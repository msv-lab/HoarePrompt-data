Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether each element in `a` (except the first one) is greater than its preceding element, and `check_all` is true.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
