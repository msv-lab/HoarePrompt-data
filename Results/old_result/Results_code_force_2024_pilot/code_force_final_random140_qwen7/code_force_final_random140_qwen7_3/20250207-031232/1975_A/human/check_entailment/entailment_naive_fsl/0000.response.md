Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the possibility of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix such that the resulting array becomes non-decreasing. Let's analyze the given example from the problem statement:

### Example Analysis
Consider the array `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. For this array, `check_all` is `False` because `a[3] (5)` is not less than `a[4] (1)`.

2. **Second Check**: The program then iterates through the array to find the first pair `(i-1, i)` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. It finds this pair at index `3` (i.e., `a[2] (4)` is not less than `a[3] (5)`).

3. **Splitting and Checking**: The program splits the array at this point and checks if the remaining part of the array (`new = a[i:]`) is such that `a[0] > new[i]` for all `i` and if `new` itself is non-decreasing. However, the program incorrectly assumes that if `a[0] > new[i]` for all `i`, then the entire array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the parts. This is not always true.

### Counterexample
Consider the array `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` again. The program will split the array at the first occurrence of a non-decreasing pair, but it does not correctly handle the case where the array cannot be made non-decreasing by any valid split.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after splitting and rearranging, the entire array becomes non-decreasing. The current implementation only checks a subset of conditions and does not guarantee that the entire array will be non-decreasing after the split and rearrangement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
