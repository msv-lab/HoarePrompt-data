Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the range is specified as `range(1, n)`).
   - The value of `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 1, so the loop will execute as long as `1 < n`, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state of `t` (which must be greater than 0) and `a` (a list of integers) do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The state of `check_all` (a boolean value) also does not affect the loop's execution directly, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is initially set to 1.

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
