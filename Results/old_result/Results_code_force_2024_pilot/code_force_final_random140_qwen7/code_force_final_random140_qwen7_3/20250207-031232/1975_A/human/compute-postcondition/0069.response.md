Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end, `new_all` is True, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be at least 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts. If the condition `check_all and new_all` is true, then `check_all` becomes True, and we break out of the loop. If the condition is false, then `check_all` remains False, but `check_all` still becomes True due to the else part, and we also break out of the loop. In both cases, the other conditions remain unchanged.
