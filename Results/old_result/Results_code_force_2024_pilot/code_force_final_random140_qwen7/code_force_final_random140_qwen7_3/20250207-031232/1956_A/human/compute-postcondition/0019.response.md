Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the first split, `q` is an integer input from the second split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then assigns the resulting list to `qs`. The values of `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial state.
