Output State: **`remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

In this case, the function `func_1(p)` is called with the list `p` as its argument. The value of `remaining_players` is determined by the execution of `func_1(p)`, but since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `remaining_players`. However, we know that `remaining_players` now holds the result of applying `func_1` to the list `p`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
