Output State: **`remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), where \(\text{count}\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`, `cur_n` is \(k + 1\), and `max_n` remains the same.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `n` to `cur_n`. Since `n` is defined as \(k + 1\), `cur_n` now holds the same value as `n`.
- The values of `remaining_players[n]`, `count`, and `max_n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
