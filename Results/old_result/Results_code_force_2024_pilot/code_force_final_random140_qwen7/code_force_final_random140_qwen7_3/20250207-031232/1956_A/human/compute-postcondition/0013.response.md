Output State: **`remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `remaining_players` joined by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `remaining_players = func_1(p)` assigns the result of calling the function `func_1` with the argument `p` to the variable `remaining_players`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The `results` list now includes a string representation of `remaining_players` joined by spaces as its last element.
