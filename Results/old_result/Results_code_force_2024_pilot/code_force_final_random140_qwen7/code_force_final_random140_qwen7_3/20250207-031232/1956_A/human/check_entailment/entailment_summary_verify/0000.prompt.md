You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:
import bisect
#Function 1:
def func_1(p):
    max_n = 100
    remaining_players = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        cur_n = n
        while cur_n >= min(p):
            count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
            cur_n -= count
        remaining_players[n] = cur_n
    return remaining_players

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        remaining_players = func_1(p)
        res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
    return results



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple sets of inputs, each consisting of integers k, q, a list p of k integers, and a list qs of q integers. For each set, it calls another function `func_1` to get the remaining players based on the list p, then extracts specific players indicated by qs. It collects these extracted lists into a results list, converts each list to a space-separated string, and finally returns a single string containing all these results concatenated together.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to simulate the game by iterating through each possible number of players `n` from 1 to 100 and determining how many players remain after each round.
   - However, the logic inside the `while` loop is flawed. It subtracts the count of players to be removed (`count`) from `cur_n`, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the sequence `p` exceeds the current number of players `cur_n`.

2. **Example to Show Incorrectness:**
   - Consider the sequence `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`.
     - In the first round, the 3rd and 5th players are supposed to be removed. However, since there are only 5 players, the 5th player is not present, so only the 3rd player (C) is removed.
     - After removing the 3rd player, the remaining players are A, B, D, E.
     - In the second round, the 3rd player (D) is removed, and the 5th player is not present, so no one is removed.
     - Therefore, the final remaining players are A and B, making 2 winners.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate this process. It will incorrectly calculate the number of remaining players after each round, leading to an incorrect result.

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
