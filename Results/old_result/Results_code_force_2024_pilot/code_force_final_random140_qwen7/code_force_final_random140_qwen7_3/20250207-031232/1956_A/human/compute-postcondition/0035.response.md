Output State: **`remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), `cur_n` is \(k + 1 - \text{count}\), and `count` is the index of the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur_n` is decremented by `count`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `remaining_players[cur_n]` is still \(-3 \times \text{count}\), and `cur_n` is now \(k + 1 - \text{count}\). The value of `count` remains the same as it was before the operation.
