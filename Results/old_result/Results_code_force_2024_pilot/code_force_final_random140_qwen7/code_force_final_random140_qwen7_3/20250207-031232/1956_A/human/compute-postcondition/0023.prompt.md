Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; `p` is a list of k positive integers in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < k; `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < q; `t` is an input integer; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    remaining_players = func_1(p)
    res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, `t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the values in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is an integer input from the first split, `q` is an integer input from the second split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing a string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
