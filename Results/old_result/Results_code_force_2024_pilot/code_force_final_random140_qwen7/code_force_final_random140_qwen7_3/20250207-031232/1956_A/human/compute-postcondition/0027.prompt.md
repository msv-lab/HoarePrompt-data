You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; p is a list of k positive integers in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < k; qs is a list of q positive integers such that 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < q.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        remaining_players = func_1(p)
        
        res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
        
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is an integer input from the last iteration's first split, `q` is an integer input from the last iteration's second split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the last iteration's third input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the last iteration's fourth input split, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)` from the last iteration, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing string representations of `res` joined by spaces from all iterations, `t` is a positive integer reduced by the number of iterations completed, which is now 0 since all iterations have been executed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `k` and `q` will hold the values from the last set of inputs provided, `p` and `qs` will contain the last lists of integers, `remaining_players` will be the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` will be the list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by `qs`, and `results` will be a list of strings, each representing the `res` list from each iteration, joined by spaces. The variable `t` will be 0 as all iterations have been completed.
    return results
    #The program returns a string that is a space-separated list of string representations of the `res` list from each iteration, where `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`. The last set of inputs provided resulted in `k` being an integer, `q` being an integer, `p` being a list of integers, `qs` being a list of integers, `remaining_players` being the result of `func_1(p)`, and `res` being a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by `qs`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `k` and `q` as positive integers (1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100), `p` as a list of `k` positive integers in strictly increasing order (1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < k), and `qs` as a list of `q` positive integers (1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < q). The function returns a string that is a space-separated list of string representations of the `res` list from each iteration, where `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string that is a space-separated list of string representations of the `res` list from each iteration, where `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`. The last set of inputs provided resulted in `k` being an integer, `q` being an integer, `p` being a list of integers, `qs` being a list of integers, `remaining_players` being the result of `func_1(p)`, and `res` being a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by `qs`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
