You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a sorted list of integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[-1] <= 100, and the length of p is k (1 <= k <= 100).
def func_1(p):
    max_n = 100
    remaining_players = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        cur_n = n
        
        while cur_n >= min(p):
            count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
            cur_n -= count
        
        remaining_players[n] = cur_n
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `remaining_players` will be a list where each element `remaining_players[n]` is calculated as follows: For each `n` from 1 to `max_n`, the variable `cur_n` starts with the value of `n` and repeatedly decreases by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` is less than `min(p)`. The final value of `cur_n` is assigned to `remaining_players[n]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `remaining_players` will contain the final value of `cur_n` for each `n` from 1 to `max_n`, which represents how much `n` would decrease by following the described process until it falls below the minimum value in `p`.
    return remaining_players
    #remaining_players is a list where each element remaining_players[n] is the final value of cur_n after it has been repeatedly decreased by the count of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n, until cur_n is less than the minimum value in p for each n from 1 to max_n.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter p, which is a sorted list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, and the length of the list is between 1 and 100. The function returns a list remaining_players where each element remaining_players[n] is the final value of cur_n after it has been repeatedly decreased by the count of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n, until cur_n is less than the minimum value in p for each n from 1 to the maximum value in p.

```

Return Postconditions: remaining_players is a list where each element remaining_players[n] is the final value of cur_n after it has been repeatedly decreased by the count of elements in p that are less than or equal to cur_n, until cur_n is less than the minimum value in p for each n from 1 to max_n.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
