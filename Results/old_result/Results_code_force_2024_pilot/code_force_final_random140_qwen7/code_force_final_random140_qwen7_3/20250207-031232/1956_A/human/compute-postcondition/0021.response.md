Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the first split, `q` is an integer input from the second split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`**.

Explanation: The code creates a new list `res` which contains elements from the list `remaining_players` at the indices specified by the list `qs`. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `remaining_players` remain unchanged from their initial states.
