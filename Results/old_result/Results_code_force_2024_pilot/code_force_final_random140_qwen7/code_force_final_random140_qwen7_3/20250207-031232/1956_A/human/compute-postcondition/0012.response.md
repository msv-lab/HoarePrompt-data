Output State: **`res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by the new `qs`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces, `qs` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `qs`. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `results`) remain unchanged in terms of their types and relationships, but `qs` is now updated with the newly converted integer values.
