Output State: **`res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, `t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `results` list. This new element is a string created by joining the elements of the `res` list with a space separator. The values of `res`, `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
