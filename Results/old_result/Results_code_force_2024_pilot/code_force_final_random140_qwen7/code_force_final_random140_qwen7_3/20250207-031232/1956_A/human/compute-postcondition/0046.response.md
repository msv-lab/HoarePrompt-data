Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `remaining_players` will be a list where each element `remaining_players[n]` is calculated as follows: For each `n` from 1 to `max_n`, the variable `cur_n` starts with the value of `n` and repeatedly decreases by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` is less than `min(p)`. The final value of `cur_n` is assigned to `remaining_players[n]`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `remaining_players` will contain the final value of `cur_n` for each `n` from 1 to `max_n`, which represents how much `n` would decrease by following the described process until it falls below the minimum value in `p`.
