Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `k` and `q` as positive integers (1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100), `p` as a list of `k` positive integers in strictly increasing order (1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < k), and `qs` as a list of `q` positive integers (1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < q). The function returns a string that is a space-separated list of string representations of the `res` list from each iteration, where `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`.**

This means the function takes four inputs: two positive integers `k` and `q`, a list `p` of `k` strictly increasing integers, and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. It then uses these inputs to generate a list `remaining_players` through some unspecified function `func_1(p)`. Finally, it creates a new list `res` by indexing into `remaining_players` using the elements of `qs`, converts each element of `res` to a string, and returns a single string that is the space-separated concatenation of these strings.
