### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of players who remain in the game after several rounds.
   - In each round, players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` are removed from the game, where `a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k`.
   - The process continues until no more players can be removed in a round.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function calculates the number of players remaining for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.
     - It iterates over each possible initial number of players (`n`) and simulates the removal process.
     - For each `n`, it keeps removing players at positions specified by `p` until no more players can be removed.
     - The result is stored in `remaining_players`, which is an array where `remaining_players[n]` gives the number of players remaining if `n` players start the game.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_1` to precompute the number of remaining players for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.
     - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
     - For each `n` in `qs`, it retrieves the corresponding value from `remaining_players` and appends it to the result list.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process for each initial number of players.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the precomputed results to answer each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the maximum limit of players (100) correctly.
   - It correctly skips positions where there are fewer players than required.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of `func_1`. Specifically, the logic for removing players is flawed. Here is why:

- In the loop where `cur_n >= min(p)`, the code should remove players from the current position `cur_n` according to the positions in `p`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the removal process. It subtracts the count of positions in `p` from `cur_n` without ensuring that the positions are removed in the correct order and without properly handling the case where `cur_n` is less than `min(p)`.

To illustrate, consider the example given in the problem statement with `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`:
- Initially, the players are `ABCDE`.
- In the first round, players `C` and `E` are removed, leaving `ABD`.
- In the second round, only player `D` is removed, leaving `AB`.

However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the way it subtracts counts and handles the positions.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the removal process for players. Therefore, the logic in `func_1` is flawed, and the overall solution will produce incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
