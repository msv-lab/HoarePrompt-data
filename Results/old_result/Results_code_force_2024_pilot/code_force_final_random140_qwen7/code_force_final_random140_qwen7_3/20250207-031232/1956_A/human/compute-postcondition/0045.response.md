Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `remaining_players` will be a list where each element `remaining_players[n]` is set to \(-k \times count\), where `count` is the index of the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-k \times count\) in the list `p`. Here, `k` is the number of iterations the loop runs, which is determined by `max_n`. `cur_n` will be less than `min(p)` after the last iteration, and `n` will be equal to `max_n + 1`.

This means that after the loop completes, each `remaining_players[n]` will reflect the final value of `cur_n` adjusted by the operations within the loop, based on the values in the list `p`. The exact values depend on the specific sequence of `p` and the value of `max_n`.
