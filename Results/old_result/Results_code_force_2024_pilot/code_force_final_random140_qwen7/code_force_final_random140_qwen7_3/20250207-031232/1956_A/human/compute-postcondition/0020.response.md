Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the first split, `q` is an integer input from the second split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with the list `p` as its argument, and the result of this function call is stored in the variable `remaining_players`. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged from their initial state.
