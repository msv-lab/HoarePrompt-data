Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the first split, `q` is an integer input from the second split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing a string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends a string to the `results` list. This string is created by joining the elements of the list `res` with spaces. The elements of `res` are selected from `remaining_players` using the indices specified in `qs`. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `remaining_players`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
