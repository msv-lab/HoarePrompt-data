Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: The problem states that `t` is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (since it's used as the upper limit in `range(t)`).

3. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer. Given that `t` is an input integer, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer**
