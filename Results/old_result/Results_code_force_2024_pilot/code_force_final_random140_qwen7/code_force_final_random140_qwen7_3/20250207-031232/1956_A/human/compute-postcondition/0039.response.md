Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `cur_n >= min(p)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\)
   - `cur_n` is \(k + 1 - \text{count} - \text{count}\) and must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`
   - `count` is the index of the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`
   - `count` is updated to the value returned by `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)`

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition is `cur_n >= min(p)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_n` must still satisfy this condition after the update.

4. **Analyze the update of `count`**:
   - `count` is updated to the value returned by `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)`.
   - This means `count` is now the index of the first element in `p` that is strictly greater than `cur_n`.

5. **Update `cur_n`**:
   - After updating `count`, `cur_n` is recalculated using the formula \(k + 1 - \text{count} - \text{count}\).
   - Since `count` has increased (as it is the index of a larger value in `p`), `cur_n` will decrease.

6. **Ensure `cur_n` remains >= `min(p)`**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cur_n` must still be greater than or equal to `min(p)` after the update.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cur_n` to ensure it remains greater than or equal to `min(p)` after the update.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`remaining_players[cur_n]` is set to \(-3 \times \text{count}\), `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `min(p)` after the update, `count` is the index of the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-2 \times \text{count}\) in the list `p`, and `count` is updated to the value returned by `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)`**
