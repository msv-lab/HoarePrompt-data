Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop variable is an underscore (`_`), but it doesn't matter what it is since it's just a placeholder. The key variables here are `t`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`.
   - `t` is a positive integer minus 1.
   - `k` and `q` are input integers.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces.
   - `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the values in `qs`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer minus 1, if we are at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `t` should be set to its value before the decrement.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `remaining_players` remains unchanged because it is the result of `func_1(p)` and does not depend on the loop counter.
- `t` should be incremented back to its original value (a positive integer).
- `k` and `q` remain unchanged.
- `p` remains unchanged.
- `qs` remains unchanged.
- `results` remains unchanged because it already has one additional element.
- `res` remains unchanged because it is derived from `remaining_players` and `qs`.

Since `t` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be set back to its original value, which is a positive integer.

**Final State:**
State: **`remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `t` is a positive integer, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the values in `qs`**
