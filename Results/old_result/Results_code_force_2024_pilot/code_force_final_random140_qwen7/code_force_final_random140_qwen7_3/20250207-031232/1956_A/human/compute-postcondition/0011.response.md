`p` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` to the input split by spaces. The previous values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `results` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is still a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`. The value of `t` is a positive integer minus 1. The values of `k` and `q` are input integers. The value of `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The value of `qs` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The value of `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces, `p` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**
