Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the first split, `q` is an integer input from the second split**.

This means that the code takes two integers as input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts, and then uses `map(int, ...)` to convert these parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to `k` and `q`. The output state reflects that `k` and `q` now hold the respective integer values from the input, while the initial state's other conditions remain unchanged.
