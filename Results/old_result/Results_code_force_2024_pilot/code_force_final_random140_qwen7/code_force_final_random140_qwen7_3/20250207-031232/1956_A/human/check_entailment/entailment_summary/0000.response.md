Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` correctly simulates the described game and produces the expected results.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` takes a sorted list `p` (where each integer is between 1 and 100) and returns a list `remaining_players` where each element `remaining_players[n]` represents the number of players left after processing the game rules for a starting lineup of `n` players.
- The logic inside `func_1` iterates over each possible starting lineup size `n` from 1 to 100 and repeatedly decreases `cur_n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.
- This logic accurately simulates the process of kicking out players as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, the list `p`, and the list `qs`.
- It then calls `func_1` to get the `remaining_players` list for the given `p`.
- It uses the `remaining_players` list to determine the number of players left for each initial lineup size specified in `qs`.
- Finally, it formats the results and appends them to the `results` list.
- The overall logic of `func_2` matches the problem description and correctly processes each test case.

### Verification:
Given the detailed descriptions of both functions and their logical correctness based on the problem statement, the implementation appears to be accurate and should produce the correct results for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
