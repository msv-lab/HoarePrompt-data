Output State: **`remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `remaining_players` joined by spaces, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the values in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `res` by using a list comprehension. Each element in `res` is taken from `remaining_players` at the index specified by each element in `qs`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
