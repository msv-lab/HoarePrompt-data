Output State: **`remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input string and converted to integers, `results` is a list with one additional element which is a string representation of `res` joined by spaces, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the values in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code appends a string representation of the list `res` (which contains elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the values in `qs`) to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged. The updated state of `results` includes the new element, which is the string representation of `res` joined by spaces.
