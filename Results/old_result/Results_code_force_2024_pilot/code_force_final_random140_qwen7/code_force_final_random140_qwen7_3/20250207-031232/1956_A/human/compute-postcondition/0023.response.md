Output State: `k` is an integer input from the last split, `q` is an integer input from the penultimate split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the ante-penultimate input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the pre-ante-penultimate input split, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)` for the final iteration, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs` for the final iteration, `results` is a list containing string representations of `res` joined by spaces for each iteration of the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `k` will hold the value of `k` from the last iteration, `q` will hold the value of `q` from the penultimate iteration, `p` will be the list of integers obtained from the ante-penultimate input split, `qs` will be the list of integers obtained from the pre-ante-penultimate input split, `remaining_players` will be the result of calling `func_1(p)` on the list `p` from the final iteration, `res` will be the list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs` from the final iteration, and `results` will be a list containing string representations of `res` joined by spaces for each iteration of the loop.
