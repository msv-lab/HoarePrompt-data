Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic. Specifically, the program always increments `arr[i]` by `i + 1` instead of `i`. According to the problem description, the correct operation is to insert `a_i + i` into the set `S`, but the program incorrectly inserts `a_i + i + 1`.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
2 1
```
The program will insert `2 + 2 = 4` and `1 + 3 = 4` into the set `S`, resulting in `S = {4}`. Sorting this set in descending order gives `b = [4]`.

However, according to the problem description, the correct values to insert are `2 + 1 = 3` and `1 + 2 = 3`, resulting in `S = {3}`. Sorting this set in descending order gives `b = [3]`.

Since the program does not correctly follow the problem description, it produces incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
