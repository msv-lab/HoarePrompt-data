### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's analyze the program and the problem statement step-by-step:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   - We need to perform operations on an array `a` of length `n` to construct a set `S` where each element is `a_i + i`.
   - After constructing `S`, we sort it in descending order to form the array `b`.

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       func_1()

   def func_1() -> None:
       n = int(input())
       arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
       st = set()
       for i in range(n):
           st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)
       print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` as input.
   - It constructs a set `st` where each element is `arr[i] + i + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints the sorted elements of `st` in descending order.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program always increments `arr[i]` by `i + 1` instead of `i`, which is incorrect.

5. **Analysis**:
   - According to the problem statement, the correct operation is to insert `a_i + i` into the set `S`.
   - The program correctly performs `arr[i] + i + 1`, which is equivalent to `a_i + i` because `i` starts from 0, making `i + 1` the correct increment.
   - For example, if `arr = [2, 1]` and `n = 2`:
     - First iteration: `i = 0`, `arr[0] + 0 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3`
     - Second iteration: `i = 1`, `arr[1] + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Set `S` will contain `{3, 3}`, which sorts to `[3]`.

   - This matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The original assessment is incorrect because the program does not have the issue it claims.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description.
