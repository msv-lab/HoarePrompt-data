### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to perform a series of operations on an array `a` of length `n`.
   - For each operation, we select an index `i` (where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`), insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S`, and remove `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain unique values.
   - We then sort `S` in descending order to form array `b`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes an empty set `st`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr`, adding `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. This ensures that each value added to `st` is unique.
   - Finally, it prints the sorted set `st` in descending order.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of adding `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st` is correct because it ensures that each value is unique.
   - Sorting the set in descending order produces the required array `b`.
   - The code does not explicitly handle the deletion of elements from `a`, but since the problem states that `a` will be empty after `n` operations, this is not necessary for the solution.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the general case where all elements in `arr` are distinct and within the specified range.
   - It correctly handles the insertion of unique values into the set and sorting them in descending order.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` by following the steps described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
