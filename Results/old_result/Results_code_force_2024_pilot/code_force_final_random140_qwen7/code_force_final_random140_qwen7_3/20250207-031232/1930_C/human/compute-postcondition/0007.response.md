Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `st` is a set containing the values `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[3] + 4`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **State the new state**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be updated to 4.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged.
   - The set `st` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `st` is a set containing the values `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[3] + 4***.
