### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to perform a series of operations on an array `a` of length `n` to construct a new array `b` that is the lexicographically largest possible.
   - Each operation involves selecting an index `i` (where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`), inserting `a[i] + i + 1` into a set `S`, and removing `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain unique values.
   - We then sort `S` in descending order to form array `b`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes an empty set `st`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr`, adding `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. This ensures that each value added to `st` is unique.
   - Finally, it prints the sorted set `st` in descending order.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of adding `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st` is correct because it ensures that each value is unique.
   - Sorting the set in descending order produces the required array `b`.
   - However, the problem specifies that we need to maximize the lexicographical order of the array `b`. The current implementation simply sorts the set `st` in descending order, which does not necessarily produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the general case where all elements in `arr` are distinct and within the specified range.
   - It correctly handles the insertion of unique values into the set and sorting them in descending order.
   - However, it does not ensure that the constructed set `st` is optimized to produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b`. The current implementation simply sorts the set `st` in descending order, which may not always produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
