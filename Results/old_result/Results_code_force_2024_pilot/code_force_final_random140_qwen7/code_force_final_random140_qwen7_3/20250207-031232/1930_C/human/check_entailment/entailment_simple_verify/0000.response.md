### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to perform the following operations exactly `n` times:
  1. Select an index `i` such that `1 \leq i \leq |a|`.
  2. Insert `a_i + i` into the set `S`.
  3. Delete `a_i` from the array `a`.

After these operations, the array `a` will be empty, and we need to construct a new array `b` by sorting the set `S` in descending order.

#### Given Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1() -> None:
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    st = set()
    for i in range(n):
        st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)
    print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using `func_1`.
- In `func_1`, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array `arr`.
- It then iterates over the array and adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`.
- Finally, it prints the sorted elements of `st` in descending order.

#### Analysis:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- However, the critical issue is in the loop where it adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st` instead of `arr[i] + i`.

According to the problem description, the correct operation is to insert `a_i + i` into the set `S`. But the program incorrectly inserts `a_i + i + 1`.

To illustrate with an example:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  2
  2 1
  ```

- The program will:
  - For the first element `2` (at index 0), it will add `2 + 0 + 1 = 3` to the set.
  - For the second element `1` (at index 1), it will add `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` to the set.
  
  So, the set `st` will be `{3, 3}`, and after sorting, it will print `[3]`.

- According to the problem description, the correct values to insert are:
  - For the first element `2` (at index 0), it should add `2 + 0 = 2` to the set.
  - For the second element `1` (at index 1), it should add `1 + 1 = 2` to the set.
  
  So, the set `st` should be `{2, 2}`, and after sorting, it should print `[2]`.

Since the program does not correctly follow the problem description, it produces incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required logic, as it increments `arr[i]` by `i + 1` instead of `i`.

**Final: False**
