Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `st` is a set containing the value `arr[0] + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The variable `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `st` does not change within the loop head and remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:
   - `i` is 2
   - `st` is a set containing the value `arr[0] + 1`
   - `n` must be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `st` is a set containing the value `arr[0] + 1`, `n` must be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**
