Postcondition: `arr` is a list of sums sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[previous_index + 2]`). If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, then the last element of `ans` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is appended to `ans`.
