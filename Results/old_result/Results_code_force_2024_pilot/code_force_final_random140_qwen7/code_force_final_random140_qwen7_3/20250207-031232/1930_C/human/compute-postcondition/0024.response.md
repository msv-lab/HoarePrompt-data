Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` for each test case defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the conditions specified, which could be either a specific value or an error message if the input does not meet the criteria.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the given instructions, only the parameters and expected behavior based on the constraints are outlined.
