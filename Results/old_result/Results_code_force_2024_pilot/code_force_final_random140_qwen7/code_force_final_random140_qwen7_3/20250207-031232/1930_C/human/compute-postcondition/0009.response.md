Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `st` is a set containing `n` elements, each element being `arr[j] + j + 1` for `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The set `st` will contain `n` elements, where each element is the sum of an element from the list `arr` (specifically `arr[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `n-1`) and the index `j` plus one (`j + 1`).
