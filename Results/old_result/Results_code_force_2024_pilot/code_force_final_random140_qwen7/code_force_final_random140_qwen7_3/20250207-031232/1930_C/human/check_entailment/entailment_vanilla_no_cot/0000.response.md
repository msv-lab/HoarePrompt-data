Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it fails to handle the deletion of elements from the array `a` and the subsequent re-indexing of elements to the right of the deleted element. Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Deletion and Index Adjustment**: The program does not adjust the indices of the remaining elements in the array `a` after deleting an element. This means that the logic for selecting the next element `i` in the subsequent iterations is incorrect because the indices of the elements in `a` are not updated properly.

2. **Set Operations**: The program adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. However, according to the problem statement, the correct operation should be `arr[i] + i`, not `arr[i] + i + 1`.

3. **Sorting and Output**: The program sorts the set `st` in descending order and prints it. While this step is correct, the issue lies in how the set `st` is populated.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that the indices are adjusted properly and that the correct value is added to the set. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the set with the correct values
    st = set()
    for i in range(n):
        st.add(arr[i] + i)
    
    # Sort the set in descending order
    sorted_st = sorted(st, reverse=True)
    
    # Print the lexicographically largest b
    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted_st)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the set `st` is populated with the correct values (`arr[i] + i`) and then sorts it in descending order before printing the result.
