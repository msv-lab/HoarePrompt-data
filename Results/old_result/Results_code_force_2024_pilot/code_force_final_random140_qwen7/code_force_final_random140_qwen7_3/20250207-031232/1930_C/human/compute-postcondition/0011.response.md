Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `st` is a set containing the values `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[3] + 4`, and `arr[i-1] + i`.

Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the set `st` will contain the following values:
- `arr[0] + 1`
- `arr[3] + 4`
- `arr[n-1] + n`

When the `print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))` statement is executed, it will sort the set `st` in descending order and then print the sorted elements separated by spaces.

Since the exact values of `arr[0]`, `arr[3]`, and `arr[n-1]` are not provided, we will represent them symbolically.

Output: **arr[3] + 4 arr[n-1] + n arr[0] + 1**
