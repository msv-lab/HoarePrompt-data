Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
