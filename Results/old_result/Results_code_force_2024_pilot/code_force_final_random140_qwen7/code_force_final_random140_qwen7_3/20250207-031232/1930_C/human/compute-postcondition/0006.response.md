Output State: **`i` is 3; `st` is a set containing the values `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[3] + 4`.**

Explanation: The code `st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)` adds the value of `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. Given that `i` is initially 2, after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The set `st` initially contains the value `arr[0] + 1`. After adding `arr[3] + 4` to the set, `st` now contains both `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[3] + 4`.
