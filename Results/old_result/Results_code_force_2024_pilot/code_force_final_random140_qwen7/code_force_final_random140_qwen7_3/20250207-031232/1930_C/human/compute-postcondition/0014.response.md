Output State: **`arr` is a list of sums sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[previous_index + 1]`), and `ans` is a list with the element `x` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `ans`. Since `x` is the next element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[previous_index + 1]`), after appending, `ans` contains `x`. The original state of `arr` and the value of `x` remain unchanged, but now `ans` includes `x`.
