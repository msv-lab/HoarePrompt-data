Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` with associated positive integers `n` and `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. It returns a value based on the sum of elements in list `a` for each test case.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts a list of integers `a` and two positive integers `n` and `t` (where `n` is the length of the list `a` and `t` is a constraint on the number of test cases). The function processes each test case, summing the elements in the list `a` for each case, and returns a value based on these sums.
