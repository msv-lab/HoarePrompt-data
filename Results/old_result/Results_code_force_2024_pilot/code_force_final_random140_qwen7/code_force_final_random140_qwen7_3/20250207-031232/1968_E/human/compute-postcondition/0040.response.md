Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes two inputs, `t` and `n`. For each test case defined by `t`, it prints specific pairs of integers. Initially, it prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. Then, it iterates from 3 to `n + 1`, printing each integer twice. After completing all iterations, the final value of the loop variable `i` will be `n + 2`, with the constraint that `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute fully. The function does not return any value.**
