Output State: **t is 0, and n is an integer that is at least 3. If n equals 3, then i will be 1. Otherwise, i will be 0.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be reduced to 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The variable `n` will be at least 3 because it is initially an integer between 1 and 50, and any value less than 3 would have been incremented to 3 by the loop's logic. If `n` was exactly 3, it will remain 3. If `n` was greater than 3, it will be decremented to 3 during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `n-2` to 0, and once `i` reaches 0, the loop ends.
