Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n + 1` (inclusive). This means the loop continues as long as `i < n + 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 6
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3

4. **Determine if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 2`. Given that `i` is currently 6, the loop will continue if `n + 2 > 6`, which simplifies to `n > 4`.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is now 6, it will be incremented to 7 in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 4.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 7, `n` must be greater than 4**
