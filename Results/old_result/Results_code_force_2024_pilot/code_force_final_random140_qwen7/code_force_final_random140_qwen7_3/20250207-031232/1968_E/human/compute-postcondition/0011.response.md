Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 7.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 50, `n` must be at least 8 for the loop to run completely, and the last value printed by the loop (which is the final value of `i`) is 7.
