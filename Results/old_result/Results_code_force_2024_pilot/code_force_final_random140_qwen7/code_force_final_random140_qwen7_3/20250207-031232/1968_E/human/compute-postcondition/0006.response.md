Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(3, n + 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 3 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 4.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` (which will be 4) must still be less than `n + 2`. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 (since 4 < n + 2 implies n >= 5).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to update the state to reflect the next iteration of the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head. The variable `i` will be 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 4**
