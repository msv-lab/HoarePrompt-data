Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but this does not give us a concrete value since `t` itself is not explicitly defined. However, it suggests that `t` is being set to one less than its current value.
- `i` is defined as `n - 1`, where `n` must be at least 3. This means `i` will be `n - 1`, and since `n` is at least 3, `i` will be at least 2.

Given these conditions, the value of `i` will be `n - 1`, and since `n` is at least 3, `i` will be at least 2. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we can only say that `i` is `n - 1`.

Output: **i (where i is n - 1 and n is at least 3)**
