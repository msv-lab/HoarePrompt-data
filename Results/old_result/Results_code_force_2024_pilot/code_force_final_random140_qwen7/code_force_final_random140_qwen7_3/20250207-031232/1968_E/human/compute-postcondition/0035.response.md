Output State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 4.

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` set to 3 (since `range(3, n + 2)` is used) and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. The loop will continue until `i` exceeds `n + 1`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to run at least 3 times, `n` must be greater than 4, as confirmed by the given output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations.
