Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `i` is 4.

The print statement is `print(i, i)`.

Since `i` is explicitly stated to be 4, the print statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **4 4**
