Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but this definition is recursive and does not provide a concrete value for `t` without an initial value.
- `i` is defined as `n - 1`.
- `n` must be at least 3, meaning `n` could be any integer greater than or equal to 3.

Given these conditions, we need to determine the value of `i`:

- Since `i` is defined as `n - 1`, and `n` is at least 3, `i` would be at least 2 (if `n` is 3).

Therefore, the value of `i` will be `n - 1`, where `n` is at least 3.

Output: **i (where i is n - 1 and n is at least 3)**
