Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 10.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `j` is explicitly defined as 10.
2. The `str(j)` function converts `j` (which is 10) into the string "10".
3. The expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string "10" with a space and then with another "10", resulting in the string "10 10".

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string "10 10".

Output: **10 10**
