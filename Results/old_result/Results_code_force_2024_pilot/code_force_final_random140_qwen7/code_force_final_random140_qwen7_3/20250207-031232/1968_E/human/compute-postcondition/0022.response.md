Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 10.
- `n` must still be at least 9 for the loop to continue.

This means that currently, `i` is 9 (since it will become 10 in the next iteration), and `n` is at least 9.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Given that `i` is 9, the print statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **9 9**
