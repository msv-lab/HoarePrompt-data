Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and `n`. For each test case, it prints a series of pairs of numbers. If `n` is 3, it prints "2 3". If `n` is 4 or more, it prints "2 4" followed by pairs of numbers from 4 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` remains within the range 1 to 50, and `i` (which is the loop variable) is set to 3, while `j` (not explicitly used in the function) is implicitly set to 8.**
