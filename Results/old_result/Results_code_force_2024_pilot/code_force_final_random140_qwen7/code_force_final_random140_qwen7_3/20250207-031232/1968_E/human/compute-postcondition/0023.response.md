Output State: `i` is 10, `n` is at least 9.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 10, and `n` must remain at least 9 to ensure the loop ran through all necessary iterations. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and the requirement that `int(input())` must be greater than 8 are not changed by the loop itself and thus remain as they were after the third iteration.
