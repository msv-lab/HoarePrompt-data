Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 8, and `int(input())` must be greater than 8.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous values. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`. After executing this line, `i` becomes 8, and for the loop to continue, `int(input())` must be greater than 8.
