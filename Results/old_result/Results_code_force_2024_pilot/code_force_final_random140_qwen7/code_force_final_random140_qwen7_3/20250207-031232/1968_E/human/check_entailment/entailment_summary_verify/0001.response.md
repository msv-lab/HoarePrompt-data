### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\).
   - It prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - Then, for each \(i\) from 3 to \(n + 2\), it prints \((i, i)\).

3. **Output Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\) is 2, not 3.

   - For \(n = 3\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) should be 4, not 6.

   - For \(n = 4\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       7 7
       8 8
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) should be 6, not 9.

   - For \(n = 5\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       7 7
       8 8
       9 9
       10 10
       11 11
       12 12
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\) should be 8, not 13.

   - For \(n = 6\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       7 7
       8 8
       9 9
       10 10
       11 11
       12 12
       13 13
       14 14
       15 15
       16 16
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 6\) should be 10, not 17.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any \(n\). It always includes more points than necessary, leading to a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances than required.
