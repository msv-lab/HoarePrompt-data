Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 50, and n is an integer within the range 2 to 10^3. The function processes these values and returns different outputs based on the given conditions for each test case.**

However, since the specific output logic is not provided in the problem statement, the exact return value cannot be specified. The function likely evaluates some relationship or condition involving t and n for each test case and returns a result accordingly.
