Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `4` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `n` must be at least 9 (this variable is part of the loop head).
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `j` is 4 (this variable is part of the loop head).

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (as per the range definition `range(4, n + 1)`). Therefore, `j` will become 5.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not being modified within the loop head.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is updated to 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 9, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
