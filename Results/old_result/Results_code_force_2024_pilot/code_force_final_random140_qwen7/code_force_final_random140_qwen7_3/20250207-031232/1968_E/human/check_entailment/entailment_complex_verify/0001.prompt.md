You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 4.
    #
    #Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`. This is because the loop starts from 3 and increments `i` up to `n + 1`, making the final value of `i` equal to `n + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to run at least once, `n` must be greater than 4. Since the loop runs based on the input `n`, `n` must maintain this condition to complete all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes two inputs, `t` and `n`. For each test case defined by `t`, it prints specific pairs of integers. Initially, it prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. Then, it iterates from 3 to `n + 1`, printing each integer twice. After completing all iterations, the final value of the loop variable `i` will be `n + 2`, with the constraint that `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute fully. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. 

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\).
   - It prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - Then, for each \(i\) from 3 to \(n + 2\), it prints \((i, i)\).

3. **Output Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\). This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\) is 2, but the program outputs 3, which is incorrect.

   - For \(n = 3\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\). This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) should be 4, not 6.

   - For larger \(n\), the same pattern continues, leading to an incorrect number of distinct Manhattan distances.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any \(n\). It always includes more points than necessary, leading to a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances than required.
