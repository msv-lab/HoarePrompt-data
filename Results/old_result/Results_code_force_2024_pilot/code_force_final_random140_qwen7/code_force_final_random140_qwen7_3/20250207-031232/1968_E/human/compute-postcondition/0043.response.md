Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, and `j` is 10**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`, converting it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50 and that `n` must be at least 12 is not directly impacted by this code, but these conditions still hold unless further code changes them.
