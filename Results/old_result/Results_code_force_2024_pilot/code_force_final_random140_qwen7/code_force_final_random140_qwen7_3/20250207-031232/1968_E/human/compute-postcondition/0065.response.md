Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`. This implies that `t` is one less than its original value.
- `i` is defined as `n - 1`. Since `n` must be at least 3, `i` will be at least 2.
- `n` must be at least 3, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (`end=' '` ensures that the output ends with a space rather than a newline).

Since `i` is defined as `n - 1` and `n` must be at least 3, the smallest possible value for `i` is 2. However, without the exact value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 (if n is 3), or i where i is n - 1 and n â‰¥ 3**
