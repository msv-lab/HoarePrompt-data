Output State: `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 3.

**Natural Language Description:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will have been decremented by the number of times the loop ran, which is `n - 2` (since the loop runs from `1` to `n - 2`). The variable `i` will be set to `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` by the default amount of 1 with each iteration, and it stops just before reaching `n`. The variable `n` must initially be at least 3 for the loop to run even once.
