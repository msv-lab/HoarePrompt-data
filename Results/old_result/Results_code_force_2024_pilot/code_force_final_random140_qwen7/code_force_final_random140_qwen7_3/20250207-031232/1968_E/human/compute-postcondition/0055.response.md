Output State: `t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 12, `i` is 2, and `j` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Given that the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration (though it's not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, we can infer this from the pattern in the output states), after 3 iterations, `j` is 5. Therefore, to complete all iterations, `n` must be at least 12 (since `j` starts from 4 and increases by 1 each iteration). The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `j` starting value) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
