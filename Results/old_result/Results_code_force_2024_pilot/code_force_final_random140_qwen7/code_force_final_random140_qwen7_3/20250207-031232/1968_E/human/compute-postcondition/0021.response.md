Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 9
   - `n` must be at least 9

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(3, n + 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The condition for the loop is `3 <= i < n + 2`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 9.
   - `n` must be at least 9.

5. **Next Iteration Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 2`.
   - Since `i` is currently 9, the loop will continue as long as `9 < n + 2`.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 10.
   - `n` must still be at least 9 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
- `i` will be 10.
- `n` must still be at least 9.

### Answer:
State: **`i` is 10, `n` must be at least 9**
