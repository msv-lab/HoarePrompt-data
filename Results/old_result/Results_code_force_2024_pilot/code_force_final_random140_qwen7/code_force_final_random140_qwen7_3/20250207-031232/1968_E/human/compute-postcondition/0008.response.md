Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 2)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
   - `i` is 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 3 up to but not including `n + 2`.

4. **Analyze the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.

5. **Determine the next possible value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 3 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 5 if the loop continues.

6. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 2`. Given that `i` is currently 4, the loop will continue as long as `4 < n + 2`.

7. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**: Since `i` is 4, for the loop to continue, `n` must be such that `4 < n + 2`. This simplifies to `n > 2`. However, since `n` must already be greater than or equal to 5 (from the initial state), this condition is already satisfied.

8. **Update the state**: The only variable that needs to be updated is `i`, which will become 5 if the loop continues. The other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5**
