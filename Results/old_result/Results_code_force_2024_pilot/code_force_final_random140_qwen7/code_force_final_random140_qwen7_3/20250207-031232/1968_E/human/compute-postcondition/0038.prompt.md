Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(1, 1)
    print(1, 2)
    for i in range(3, n + 2):
        print(i, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 7.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 50, `n` must be at least 8 for the loop to run completely, and the last value printed by the loop (which is the final value of `i`) is 7.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 10, `n` must be at least 9.

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 10, and `n` must remain at least 9 to ensure the loop completed all its intended executions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 4.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will take the value of `n + 2`. This is because the loop starts from 3 (inclusive) and goes up to `n + 1` (inclusive), meaning it increments `i` until it reaches `n + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be `n + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to run at least 3 times, `n` must be greater than 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
