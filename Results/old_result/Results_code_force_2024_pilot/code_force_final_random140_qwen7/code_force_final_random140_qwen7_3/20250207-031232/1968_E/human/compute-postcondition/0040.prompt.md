You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 4.
    #
    #Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`. This is because the loop starts from 3 and increments `i` up to `n + 1`, making the final value of `i` equal to `n + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to run at least once, `n` must be greater than 4. Since the loop runs based on the input `n`, `n` must maintain this condition to complete all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes two values, t and n, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^3. The function does not return any value explicitly but is expected to perform some operations based on these parameters within its body.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
