The initial state does not provide any specific value for the variable `i`. Therefore, `i` could be any integer value. Since no specific value is given, we cannot determine the exact printed output.

However, based on the provided code snippet, the print statement will output the value of `i` followed by another instance of the same value of `i`.

Output: **i i**
