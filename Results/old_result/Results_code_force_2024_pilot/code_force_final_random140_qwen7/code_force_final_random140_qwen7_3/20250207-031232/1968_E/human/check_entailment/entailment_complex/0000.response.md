Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid.
2. The provided program attempts to print specific coordinates for each test case but does not vary these coordinates based on \( n \). Specifically, it always prints the same pairs of coordinates: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and for \( i \) from 3 to \( n + 1 \), it prints `(i, i)`.
3. Let's analyze the Manhattan distances produced by these coordinates:
   - The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` is \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
   - The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for \( i \geq 3 \) is \( |1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1) \).
   - The distance between `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for \( i \geq 3 \) is \( |1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-2) \).

4. For \( n > 4 \), the set of distances includes at least `{1, 2, 4, 6, ...}` which grows linearly with \( n \). However, this approach does not cover all possible distances efficiently for smaller \( n \).

5. For example, for \( n = 2 \):
   - The only possible distances are 0 and 1, so the set \(\mathcal{H}\) would be \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct but not maximized.

6. For \( n = 3 \):
   - The distances produced are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct but again not maximized since the optimal solution would produce \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) without redundancy.

Given the constraints and the need to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the provided solution does not achieve the goal for all values of \( n \). Therefore, the program is not correct for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
