Output State: `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 4.

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`. This is because the loop starts from 3 and increments `i` up to `n + 1`, making the final value of `i` equal to `n + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to run at least once, `n` must be greater than 4. Since the loop can run multiple times as long as `n` is greater than 4, the condition remains the same even after all iterations.
