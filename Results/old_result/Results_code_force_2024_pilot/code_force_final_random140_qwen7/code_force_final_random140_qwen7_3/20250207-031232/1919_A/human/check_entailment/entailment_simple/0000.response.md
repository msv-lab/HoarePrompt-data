Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on the optimal strategy of both players.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the given rules. Specifically, it incorrectly compares `n` and `k` without considering the sequence of moves and the ability to swap wallets.
3. According to the game rules, the key observation is that if one player has more coins than the other, the player with fewer coins can always force a win by swapping wallets and then reducing their own count. Conversely, if both players have the same number of coins, the player whose turn it is will lose because they will be forced to reduce their count to zero and then be unable to make a move.
4. The provided solution only checks if `n > k` or `n < k` and prints the result accordingly. This does not account for the optimal strategy where players can swap wallets to maintain control over the game state.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the game rules.

Correctness: **False**
