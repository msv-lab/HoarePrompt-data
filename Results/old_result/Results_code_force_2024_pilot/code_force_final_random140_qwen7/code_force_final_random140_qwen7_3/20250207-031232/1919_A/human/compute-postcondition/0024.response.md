Output State: **`rep` is 1, `_rep` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the values of `n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user separated by space.**

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers, and then `n, k = ...` assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. The variables `rep` and `_rep` remain unchanged with their initial values of 1.
