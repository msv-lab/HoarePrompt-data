Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, input is split into two integers and assigned to `n` and `k` respectively.**

The code takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The value of `rep` remains unchanged.
