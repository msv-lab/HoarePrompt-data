Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `_rep`, which is used as the iterator in the `range(t)` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of `_rep`**: Since `_rep` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (as is the default behavior of `range(t)`), we need to ensure that `_rep` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `_rep` is less than `t`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer and `_rep` is initialized to 0.

4. **Consider the given states**: We are given that `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), and `t` is an input integer.

5. **Adjust the states**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `_rep` to 0 and ensure that `t` is a positive integer. The values of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `_rep` and `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`_rep` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer**
