Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`, and `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`, the length of `s` is now stored in `n`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.
