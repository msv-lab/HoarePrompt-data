Output State: **`ans` is 0 if `s[i] - s[i - 1]` was greater than 1, and 1 if `s[i] - s[i - 1]` was less than or equal to 1, where `i` is within the range [3, n-1], `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`, and `n` is the length of `s`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = 1 - ans` flips the value of `ans`. If `ans` was previously 1 (indicating `s[i] - s[i - 1]` was greater than 1), it is now 0. Conversely, if `ans` was previously 0 (indicating `s[i] - s[i - 1]` was less than or equal to 1), it is now 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
