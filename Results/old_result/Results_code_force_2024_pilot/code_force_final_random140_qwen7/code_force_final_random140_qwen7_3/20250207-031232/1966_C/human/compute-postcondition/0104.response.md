Output State: The set `s` contains all elements from the list `arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr` exactly once, since each element is added to the set `s` in each iteration. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration and runs until `i` reaches `n`. The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` is always true, as it simply confirms that the loop ran the expected number of times corresponding to the length of the list `arr`.
