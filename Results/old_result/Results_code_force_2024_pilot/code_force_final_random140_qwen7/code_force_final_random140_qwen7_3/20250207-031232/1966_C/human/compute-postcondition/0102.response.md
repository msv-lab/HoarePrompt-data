Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr[i]` is added to set `s`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i + 1` (which is the new value of `i`).

Given these points, we need to update the state accordingly:

- The value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue requires `n` to be greater than or equal to `i + 1` (the new value of `i`).

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`arr[i]` is added to set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`**
