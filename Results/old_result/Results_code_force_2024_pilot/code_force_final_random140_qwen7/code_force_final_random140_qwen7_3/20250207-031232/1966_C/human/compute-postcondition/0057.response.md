Output State: **`arr[i+2]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s.add(arr[i])` is executed**

Explanation: The code adds `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Before this operation, `arr[i+2]` was already added to the set `s`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after executing `s.add(arr[i])`, `arr[i+2]` remains in the set `s`, `i` is now `i + 1`, and the set `s` has been updated to include `arr[i]`.
