Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2 and `n` is the length of list `s`. The code `ans = 1 - ans` updates the value of `ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we assume it to be 1 (a common default value). After executing `ans = 1 - ans`, `ans` becomes 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
