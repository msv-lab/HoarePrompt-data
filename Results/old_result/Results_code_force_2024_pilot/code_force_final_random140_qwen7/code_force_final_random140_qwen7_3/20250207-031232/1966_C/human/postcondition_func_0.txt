The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) and a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the sorted unique elements of the list. If the length of the unique elements list is 2, it directly prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements is always 1, toggling a boolean flag `ans` accordingly. Finally, it prints 'Alice' if `ans` is true, indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it prints 'Bob'.
