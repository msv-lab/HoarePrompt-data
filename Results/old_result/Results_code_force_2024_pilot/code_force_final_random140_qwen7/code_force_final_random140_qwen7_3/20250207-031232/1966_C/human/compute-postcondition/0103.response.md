Output State: **`arr[i]` is added to set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2` remains valid. Therefore, the updated state includes these changes.
