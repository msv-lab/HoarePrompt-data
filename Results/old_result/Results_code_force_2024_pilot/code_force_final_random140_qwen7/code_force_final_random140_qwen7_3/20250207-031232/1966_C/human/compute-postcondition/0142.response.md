Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`, and `n` is the length of `s`. If `n` equals 2, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `ans` is true, it remains true; otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.
