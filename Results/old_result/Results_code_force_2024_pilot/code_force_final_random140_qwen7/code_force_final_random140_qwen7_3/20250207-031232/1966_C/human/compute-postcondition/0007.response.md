Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n` is a valid non-negative integer; `s` is a set containing `arr[0]` and `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `i` can be either 1 or 2, `arr[i]` will be either `arr[1]` or `arr[2]`. The set `s` initially contains `arr[0]`, and after adding `arr[i]`, it will contain both `arr[0]` and `arr[i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the initial state of `s` remain unchanged.
