Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is either 0 or 1.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `s` is a list of integers with a 0 prepended to the original list of unique elements from `arr`.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- The value of `ans` is true.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Alice'` to the console. Since there are no variables or objects within the print statement itself that need to be evaluated, the output is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
