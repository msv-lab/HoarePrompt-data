Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(n)`. This means that `i` takes values from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`. This implies that `i` was incremented or updated in the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range of `range(n)`. Since `i` was incremented in the previous iteration, it will be incremented again in the next iteration unless it reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**: 
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `s` will contain the elements added up to the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was incremented in the previous iteration, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head and their states are not directly affected by the loop itself, we only need to update `i` and ensure that `s` contains the elements added up to the new value of `i`.

If we assume that `i_end` was `k` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `arr[i]` is added to set `s`, where `i` is `k + 1`**.

To generalize this, if we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can say:

**State: `arr[i]` is added to set `s`, where `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

So, the final answer is:

**State: `arr[i]` is added to set `s`, where `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
