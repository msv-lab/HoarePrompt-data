Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is equal to the length of set `s`, `ans` is 0, and we break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop. Since the loop condition was checking whether `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, and the code breaks out of the loop regardless of the condition's outcome, `ans` remains 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify them.
