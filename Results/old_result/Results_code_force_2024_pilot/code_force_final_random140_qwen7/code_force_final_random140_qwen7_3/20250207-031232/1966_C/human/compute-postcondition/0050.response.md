Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is an empty set, `ans` is 1, either `n` is equal to 2 or `i` is 3 and `ans` is 0, and the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was not met for any `i` from 1 to 3; `arr` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The line `s = set()` creates an empty set named `s`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
