Output State: **`arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since sets only store unique elements, if `arr[i]` was already present in `s`, it would remain unchanged. The state of `arr` and any other variables not affected by this line of code remains the same. Therefore, the output state is that `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.
