Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.
   - This implies that `i` was incremented in the previous iteration.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`, it means that `i` was incremented in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented again.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `i` needs to be incremented to the next value.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is a constant defined before the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr[i]` is added to set `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`**.

Since the exact value of `i` is not given, we can represent it as `i + 1` where `i` was the value at the end of the previous iteration.

Final State: **`arr[i]` is added to set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**.
