Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n-1`. The variable `n` remains a valid non-negative integer, and `s` is a set containing all elements from the list `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the value of `n` minus one. The set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr`, starting from `arr[0]` up to `arr[n-1]`.
