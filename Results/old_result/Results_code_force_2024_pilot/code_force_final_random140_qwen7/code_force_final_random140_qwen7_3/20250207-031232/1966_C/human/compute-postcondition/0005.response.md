Output State: **`i` is 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1), `n` is a valid non-negative integer, `s` is a set containing `arr[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1), the set `s` now contains the first element of the array `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
