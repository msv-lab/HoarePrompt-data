Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is the new input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate values from 0 to `n-1`). If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.
   - The initial value of `i` (`n-1`) will be decremented in each iteration until it reaches 0. Therefore, `i` will take on all values from `n-1` down to 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop can only execute if `n` is at least 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, but this is not relevant for ensuring the loop can execute. What matters is that `i` will decrement from `n-1` to 0, and as long as `n` is at least 1, the loop will run.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
