Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically discarded. However, the value being passed to `range()` is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` results in a valid number of iterations.

3. **Constraints and requirements**:
   - `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` (the number of integers in the list) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the valid range for `t`.
   - The value of `t` itself does not directly affect the loop's execution but determines how many times the loop will run.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
