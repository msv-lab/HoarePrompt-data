Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `s` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `s`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
