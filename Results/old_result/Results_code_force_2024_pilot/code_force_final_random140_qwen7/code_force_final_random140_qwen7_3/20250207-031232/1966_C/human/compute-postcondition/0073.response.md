Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, n-2], `n` is equal to the length of set `s`, `ans` is 0, and `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated to `1 - ans`. Given the initial state where `ans` remains 1, after executing `ans = 1 - ans`, `ans` becomes 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
