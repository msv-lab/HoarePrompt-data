Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s` in the previous iteration, so in the next iteration, `arr[i+2]` will be added to the set `s`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`arr[i+2]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`**
