Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is set to 1 (since `1 - 1` equals 0). The code `ans = 1 - ans` flips the value of `ans`. If `ans` was initially 1, it becomes 0. The conditions involving `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
