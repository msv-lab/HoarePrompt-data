Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is now the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing 0 as its first element followed by all elements from the list `arr` up to index `n-1`, `ans` is 1, and either `n` is equal to 2 or `i` is 3 and `ans` is 0, and the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was not met for any `i` from 1 to 3.
