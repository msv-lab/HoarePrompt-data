Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `ans`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since the initial conditions of `i` being 3 and `ans` being 0 are not affected by the `break` statement, these values remain the same.
