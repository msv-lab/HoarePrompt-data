Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the provided state before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. In the first iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i` and `n`**: Since the loop will start with `i = n-1`, the loop will run exactly once (because after the first iteration, `i` will become `n`, and the condition `i < n` will fail).

5. **Consider the other variables**: The variables `ans`, `arr`, and `s` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be `n-1` and the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
