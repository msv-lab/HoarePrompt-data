Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list of integers containing all unique elements from the list `arr` converted to a list, and the variable `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `ans`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `s`, or `n`. The initial conditions state that `i` is equal to `n`, `s` contains all unique elements from the list `arr` converted to a list, and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, these conditions are preserved, and only `ans` is updated to 1.
