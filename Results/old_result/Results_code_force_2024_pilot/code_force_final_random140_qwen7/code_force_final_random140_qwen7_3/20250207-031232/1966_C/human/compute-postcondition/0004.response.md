Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
   - `s` is an empty set.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1) and `n` is a valid integer.
   - `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition, but it should still be within its specified range for consistency.
   - `arr` and `s` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they don't need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `i` should start at 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1).
   - `n` must be a valid integer and non-negative.

Given this reasoning, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1), `n` is a valid non-negative integer**.
