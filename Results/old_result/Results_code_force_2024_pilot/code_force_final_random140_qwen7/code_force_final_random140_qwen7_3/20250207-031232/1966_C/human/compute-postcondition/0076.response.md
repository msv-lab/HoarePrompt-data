Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is within the range \([1, n-2]\)
   - `n` is equal to the length of set `s`
   - `ans` is either 1 (if \(s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1\) and we break out of the loop) or 0 (if \(s[i] - s[i - 1] \leq 1\))

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to \(n-2\). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` is within the range \([1, n-2]\), the next value of `i` will be \(i + 1\).

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be within the range \([1, n-2]\).
   - This means \(1 \leq i + 1 \leq n - 2\), which simplifies to \(0 \leq i \leq n - 3\).

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if the current `i` is \(i\), the new `i` will be \(i + 1\).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of set `s`.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop body changes it.

Given these points, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is \(i + 1\), `n` is equal to the length of set `s`, and `ans` is either 1 (if \(s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1\) and we break out of the loop) or 0 (if \(s[i] - s[i - 1] \leq 1\))**.
