Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a valid non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is now a list containing 0 as its first element followed by all elements from the list `arr` up to index `n-1`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally contained all elements from the list `arr` up to index `n-1`, after the operation, `s` will start with `0` followed by the original elements of `s`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
