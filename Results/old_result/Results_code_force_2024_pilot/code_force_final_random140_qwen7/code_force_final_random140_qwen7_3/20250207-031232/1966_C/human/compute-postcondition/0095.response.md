Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `ans` is either true or false, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by mapping each element from the input (split by spaces) to an integer. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new list `arr` contains the integers entered as input.
