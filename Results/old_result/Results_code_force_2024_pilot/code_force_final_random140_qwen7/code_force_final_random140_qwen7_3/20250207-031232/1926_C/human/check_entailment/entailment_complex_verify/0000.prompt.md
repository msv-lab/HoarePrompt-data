You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Annotated Code: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer n within the range 1 to 200,000 (inclusive) and returns the sum of its digits.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 0 to 12 instead of calculating the sum of the digits for numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case. 

For example, if \(n = 12\), the program will calculate the sum of the digits for the numbers 0 through 12, which includes 0, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach would involve iterating from 1 to \(n\) and replacing each number with the sum of its digits, then summing those values.
