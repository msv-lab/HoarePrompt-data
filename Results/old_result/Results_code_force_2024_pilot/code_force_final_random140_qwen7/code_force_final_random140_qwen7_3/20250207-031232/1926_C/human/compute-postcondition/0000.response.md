Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.**

This means that the program converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back into an integer, and sums these integers. The result of this summation is then returned.
