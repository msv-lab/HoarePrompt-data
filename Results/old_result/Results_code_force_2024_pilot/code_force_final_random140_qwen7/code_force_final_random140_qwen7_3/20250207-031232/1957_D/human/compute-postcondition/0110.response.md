Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[1][0]` is 2, `suf[0][1]` is either unchanged or decremented by 1, and `suf[1][1]` is either unchanged or decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `pre[2][0]` is incremented by 1. Since `pre[1][0]` was either 1 or 2, after incrementing, `pre[2][0]` will be 2 (assuming it was 1 before). The values of `c`, `suf[0][1]`, and `suf[1][1]` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
