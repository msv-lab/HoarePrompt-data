Output State: `i` is 30, `j` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, and for every `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` represent the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.

This means that after the loop has executed all 32 iterations (from `j = 0` to `j = 31`), the variable `j` will be 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` will contain the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and `suf[j][1]` will contain the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.
