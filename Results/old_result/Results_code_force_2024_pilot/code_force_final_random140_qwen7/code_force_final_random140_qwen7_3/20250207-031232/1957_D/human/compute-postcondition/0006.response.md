Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer that must have at least two elements, `prefix` is a list containing three integers where the third integer is the bitwise XOR of the second integer and the first element of the new `arr`, `v` is the first element of the new `arr`**.

Explanation: The code appends the bitwise XOR of the last element in the `prefix` list and the first element of the new `arr` (which is stored in `v`) to the `prefix` list. Since the `prefix` list originally had two elements, after the operation, it now has three elements. The value of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
