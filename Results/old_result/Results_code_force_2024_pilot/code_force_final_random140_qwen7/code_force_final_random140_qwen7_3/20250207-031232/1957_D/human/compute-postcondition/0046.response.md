Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` is 0, `suf[0][1]` is incremented. The other variables remain unchanged.
