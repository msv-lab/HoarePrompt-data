Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(32)`. The variables involved here are `j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < 32`.

3. **Determine the current state of `j`**: According to the postcondition given, `j` is an integer + 1. This means that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was already incremented by 1.

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**: Since `j` is an integer + 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it means `j` was `31` before the increment (because `31 + 1 = 32`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `32`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: The loop will continue if `j < 32`. Since `j` will be `32` at the start of the next iteration, the condition `j < 32` will be false, and the loop will terminate.

6. **Adjust the states**: We only need to adjust the state of `j` since it is the only variable in the loop head.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is 32, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1 if `(cur >> j & 1)` is false, and `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1 if `(cur >> j & 1)` is true**.
