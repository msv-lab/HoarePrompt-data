Output State: **`i` is 29, `j` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[29]`, and for every `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` represent the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur` to be `prefix[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 29, `cur` is now updated to `prefix[29]`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `suf`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
