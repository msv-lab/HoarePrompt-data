Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop condition. In this case, the loop variable is `i`, and the loop runs from `n` to `0` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 31.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` is currently 31, the next value of `i` would be 30.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than `0`. Since `i` will be 30 in the next iteration, the condition `i > 0` will still hold true.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the state to reflect the new value of `i` and ensure that the other variables remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 64, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`**.
