Output State: **`i` is 31; `j` is less than 32; the value of `(cur >> j & 1)` is true; `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` must be less than 32 and the current value of `(cur >> j & 1)` is true, `j` is a valid index for the array `suf`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
