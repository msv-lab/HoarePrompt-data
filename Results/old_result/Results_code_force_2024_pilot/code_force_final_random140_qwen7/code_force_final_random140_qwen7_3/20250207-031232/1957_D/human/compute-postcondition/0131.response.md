Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is 1, `pre[1][0]` is 1, `pre[1][1]` is 1, and `suf[1][1]` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, `suf[1][1]` is decremented from its initial value of 0 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
