Postcondition: `i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, and `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` represent the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`. If the least significant bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. If the least significant bit of `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.
