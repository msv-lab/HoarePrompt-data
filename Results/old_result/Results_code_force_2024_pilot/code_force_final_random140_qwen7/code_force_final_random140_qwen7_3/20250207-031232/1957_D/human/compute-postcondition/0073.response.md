Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is an integer + 1, `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. The initial state indicates that `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1 if `(cur >> j & 1)` is false, and `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1 if `(cur >> j & 1)` is true. Since the code only modifies `suf[j][1]`, it increases its value by 1. All other variables remain in their initial states.
