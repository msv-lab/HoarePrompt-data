Output State: **`j` is 31, `c` is an integer, `pre[31][0]` is 32, `pre[31][1]` is 0, `suf[31][0]` is 0, and `suf[31][1]` is -32, `i` is 32, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[31]`**.

In this case, the code `y = arr[i - 1]` assigns the value of `arr[31]` (since `i` is 32) to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
