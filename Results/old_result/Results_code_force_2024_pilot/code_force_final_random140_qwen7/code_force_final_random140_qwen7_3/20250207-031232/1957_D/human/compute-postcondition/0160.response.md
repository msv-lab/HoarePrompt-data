Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is 1, `suf[0][1]` is 0, `pre[0][0]` is 0, `suf[0][0]` is -1**.

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, `suf[1][1]` would be decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `suf[0][1]` is 1, after decrementing by 1, its new value becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
