Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is still 31, `j` is 64, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.**

This means that after the loop completes all 32 iterations (since `range(32)` will iterate from 0 to 31), the variable `j` will be 32, but since it increments before checking the condition, it effectively ends at 64. The array `suf` will contain counts of 1s and 0s starting from each bit position down to the least significant bit of `cur`.
