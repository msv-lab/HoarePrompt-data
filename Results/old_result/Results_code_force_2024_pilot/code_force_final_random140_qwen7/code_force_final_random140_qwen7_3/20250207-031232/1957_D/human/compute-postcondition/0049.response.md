Postcondition: `i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[j][0]` is the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and `suf[j][1]` is the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`. If the least significant bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. If the least significant bit of `cur` is 0, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.
