Postcondition: `j` is 1, `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is 1, `pre[1][0]` is either 1 or 2, and `suf[1][0]` is -1. If the 0-th bit of `c` is 1 (which it is according to the precondition), then depending on additional conditions within the if part, `pre[1][0]` could be set to 1 or 2. Otherwise, `pre[1][0]` is set to 2.
