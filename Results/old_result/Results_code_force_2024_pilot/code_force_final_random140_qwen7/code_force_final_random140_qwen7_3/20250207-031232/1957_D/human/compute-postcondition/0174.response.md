Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `j` is 31, `c` is an integer where the highest bit (31st bit) is 1, `pre[31][0]` is 0, `pre[31][1]` is 32, `suf[31][0]` is -32, and `suf[31][1]` is -32.

This means that after the loop completes, `c` will have its highest bit set to 1, indicating it is a non-zero integer. The counts in `pre[31]` reflect that there are no zeros (since `pre[31][0]` is 0) and 32 ones across all bits up to the 31st bit. Similarly, `suf[31]` indicates that there are no additional zeros beyond the 31st bit (hence `-32` for `suf[31][0]`) and 32 ones (hence `-32` for `suf[31][1]`).
