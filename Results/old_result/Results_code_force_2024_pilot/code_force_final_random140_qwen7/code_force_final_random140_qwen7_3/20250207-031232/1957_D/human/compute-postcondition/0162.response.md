Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[1][0]` is 2, `suf[0][1]` is unchanged, `pre[0][0]` is 0, `suf[0][0]` is -1, `suf[1][0]` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, the value of `suf[1][0]` is decreased by 1. Initially, `suf[1][0]` was unchanged from its initial state, which means it was equal to 2 (as per the initial state). After decrementing, `suf[1][0]` becomes 1 - 1 = -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
