Output State: **`i` is 31, `j` is less than 32, and the j-th bit of `cur` is 0; `suf[j][0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Since `j` is less than 32 and the j-th bit of `cur` is 0, the value of `suf[j][0]` was initially 0 (as it is not specified otherwise). After executing the code, `suf[j][0]` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition about the j-th bit of `cur` also remains valid.
