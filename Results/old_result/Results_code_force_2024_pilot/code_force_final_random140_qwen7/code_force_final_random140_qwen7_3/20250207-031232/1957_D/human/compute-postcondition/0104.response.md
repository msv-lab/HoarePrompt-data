Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[1][0]` is 2, `suf[j][0]` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, the value of `suf[1][0]` is initially decremented from 0 (as stated in the initial state) to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
