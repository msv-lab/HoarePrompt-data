Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The state before the loop starts indicates that `i` is currently 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, n+1)`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since `i` is initially 1, for the loop to start executing, `i` should be 1 and `n` should be at least 1 (since the loop runs from 1 to `n+1`).

5. **Adjust the state of `n`**: To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

6. **Other variables**: The other variables (`j`, `cur`, `suf`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Based on the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
