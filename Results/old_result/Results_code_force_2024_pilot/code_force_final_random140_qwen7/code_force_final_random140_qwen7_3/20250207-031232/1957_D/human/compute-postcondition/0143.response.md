Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is 31, `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is 1, `pre[j][0]` is 1 or 2 for all `j` from 0 to 31, and `suf[j][1]` is 0 for all `j` from 0 to 30, and `suf[31][1]` is -32.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all 32 iterations (`j` ranging from 0 to 31), the value of `j` will be 31. The variable `c` remains an integer, and its 0-th bit is 1 as it was initially set to 32 (which has the 0-th bit as 0, but it gets flipped to 1 in the first iteration). For each bit position `j`, `pre[j][0]` will be either 1 or 2 depending on whether the bit was 0 or 1 respectively in the original value of `c`. Since `c` was 32, the 0-th bit is 1, and all other bits are 0, `pre[j][0]` will be 1 for `j` from 1 to 31 and 2 for `j` = 0. The `suf[j][1]` array will have `-1` for each `j` from 0 to 30 because the 0-th bit was 1, and thus `suf[j][1]` is decremented once per iteration for those positions. Finally, `suf[31][1]` will be `-32` since the loop runs 32 times, decrementing `suf[31][1]` by 1 in each iteration.
