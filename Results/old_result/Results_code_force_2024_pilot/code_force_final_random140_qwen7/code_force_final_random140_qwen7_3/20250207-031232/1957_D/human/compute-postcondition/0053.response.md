Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 2, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[2][0]` is 1 and `suf[1][0]` and `suf[1][1]` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of bits set to 0 in the suffix starting from the j-th bit (where j was 1 before the increment) for the current value of `cur`. Initially, `j` is 1, so after executing `suf[j][0] += 1`, the count of bits set to 0 in the suffix starting from the 1st bit is incremented by 1. Since `j` is now 2, the updated state for `j` is 2, and the count of bits set to 0 in the new suffix (starting from the 2nd bit) is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
