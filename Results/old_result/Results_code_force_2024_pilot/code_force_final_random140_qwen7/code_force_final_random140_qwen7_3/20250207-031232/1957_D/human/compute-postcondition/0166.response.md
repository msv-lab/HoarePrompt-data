Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][0]` is 0, `pre[2][1]` is 1, `suf[0][0]` is -1**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value at `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1. Since `pre[2][1]` was initially undefined (or 0 if no prior assignment), it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
