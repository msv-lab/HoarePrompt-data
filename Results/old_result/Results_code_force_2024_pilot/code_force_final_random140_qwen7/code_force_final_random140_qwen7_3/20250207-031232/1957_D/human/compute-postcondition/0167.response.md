Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][0]` is 0, `pre[2][1]` is 1, `suf[0][0]` is -1, `suf[2][1]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `suf[2][1]` is initially 1, and after the operation, it becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
