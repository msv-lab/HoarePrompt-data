Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result based on the sum of the integers in each test case, ensuring the total sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer t and a list of integers. It calculates the sum of integers in each list and returns a result based on these sums, with the constraint that the total sum of all integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
