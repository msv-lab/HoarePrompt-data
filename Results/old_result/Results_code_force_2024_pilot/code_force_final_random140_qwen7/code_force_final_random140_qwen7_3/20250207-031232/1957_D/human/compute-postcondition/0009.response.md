Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `prefix` is a list containing as many integers as there are elements in `arr`, where each element in `prefix` (except the first one) is the bitwise XOR of the previous element in `prefix` and the corresponding element in `arr`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `prefix` will contain an entry for every element in `arr`, with each entry being the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point.
