Postcondition: `j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][0]` is either 0 or 1, `suf[0][0]` is either -1 or -2, `pre[2][1]` is 1, `suf[2][1]` is 0. If `c` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise AND with 1 is true, then `pre[0][0]` is set to 0 and `suf[0][0]` remains -1. Otherwise, `pre[0][0]` is set to 1 and `suf[0][0]` is set to -2.
