Output State: **`j` is 0; `c` is an integer where the result of `(c >> j & 1)` is 0; `pre[j][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0 and the result of `(c >> j & 1)` is 0, `pre[0][0]` was initially 0 (since `(c >> 0 & 1)` is 0). After executing `pre[j][0] += 1`, `pre[0][0]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
