Postcondition: `j` is 1, `c` is an integer. If shifting `c` right by `j` bits and performing bitwise AND with 1 results in a non-zero value, then `pre[1][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[0][1]` is unchanged, and `suf[1][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pre[1][0]` is set to 2 and `suf[1][0]` is set to -1.
