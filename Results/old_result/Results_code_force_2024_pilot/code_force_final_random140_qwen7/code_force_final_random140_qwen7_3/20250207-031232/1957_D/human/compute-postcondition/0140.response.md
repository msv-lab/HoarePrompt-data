Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is 1, `pre[1][0]` is 2, and `suf[1][0]` is -2.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the affected element is `suf[2][0]`. Initially, `suf[1][0]` is -1. Since the index 2 does not have a specified value, we assume it is being initialized or updated here. Thus, `suf[2][0]` is set to `-1 - 1 = -2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
