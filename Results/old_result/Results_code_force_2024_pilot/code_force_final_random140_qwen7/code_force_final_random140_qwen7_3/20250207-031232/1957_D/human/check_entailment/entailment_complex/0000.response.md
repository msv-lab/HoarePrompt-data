Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
3. It constructs a prefix XOR array, which is necessary for efficiently calculating the XOR of any subarray.
4. The program initializes two lists (`pre` and `suf`) to keep track of the counts of zeros and ones for each bit position (from 0 to 31) in the prefix and suffix XOR values.
5. It iterates through the prefix XOR values and updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays accordingly.
6. For each element in the array, it calculates the number of valid tuples using the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
7. The final result is printed for each test case.

Given the detailed state transitions and the logical flow of the program, the program appears to follow the correct algorithm for solving the problem. The steps to compute the number of valid tuples are implemented correctly based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
