Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` remains 29, `j` is 32, `cur` remains as the initial value (which is an integer), and for every `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` represents the count of bits set to 0 and `suf[j][1]` represents the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over all bits from 0 to 31. For each bit position `j`, it checks the value of the `j`-th bit of `cur` using `(cur >> j) & 1`. If the bit is 1, it increments `suf[j][1]`; if the bit is 0, it increments `suf[j][0]`. After 32 iterations, `j` becomes 32, and the loop terminates. The value of `i` and `cur` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
