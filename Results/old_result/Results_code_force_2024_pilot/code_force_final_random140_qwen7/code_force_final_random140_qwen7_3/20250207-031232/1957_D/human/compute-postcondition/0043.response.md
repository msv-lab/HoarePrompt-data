Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `j`. The loop will iterate over the range from 0 to 31 (inclusive), as specified by `range(32)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is given as 64. However, for the loop to start executing, `j` must be within the range of 0 to 31.

3. **Adjust the state of `j`**: Since the loop requires `j` to be in the range of 0 to 31, we need to adjust the initial value of `j` to be within this range. The closest valid starting point would be `j = 0`.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `cur`, `suf[j][0]`, and `suf[j][1]`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be within the range of 0 to 31, specifically starting at 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`**.
