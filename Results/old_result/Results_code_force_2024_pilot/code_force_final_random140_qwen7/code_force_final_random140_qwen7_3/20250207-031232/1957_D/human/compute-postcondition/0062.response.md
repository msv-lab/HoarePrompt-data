Output State: `i` is 30, `j` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, and for every `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` represent the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`. Specifically, `suf[31][1]` will be 1 if the most significant bit of `cur` is 1, and `suf[31][0]` will be 1 if the most significant bit of `cur` is 0. For all other `j` values, `suf[j][1]` and `suf[j][0]` will reflect the cumulative counts of 1s and 0s from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.

This means that after the loop completes, `j` will have reached 31, and for each bit position from 0 to 31, we will have the exact count of 1s and 0s from that bit position to the most significant bit of `cur`.
