Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is 1, `pre[1][0]` is 2, and `suf[1][0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given the initial state where `pre[1][0]` is 1, after executing the code, `pre[1][0]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
