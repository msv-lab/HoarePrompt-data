Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`**: According to the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j < 32`.

4. **Calculate the New Value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop will increment `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Adjust the Other States**: The other states (`c`, `pre[1][0]`, and `suf[1][0]`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer where the 0-th bit is 1, `pre[1][0]` is either 1 or 2, and `suf[1][0]` is -1**.
