Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `prefix` is a list containing four integers where the fourth integer is the bitwise XOR of the third integer and the second element of the new `arr`, `v` is the second element of the new `arr`**.

Explanation: The code appends to the `prefix` list the value of `v` XORed with the last element of the `prefix` list. Here, `v` is the second element of the new `arr`. Therefore, the `prefix` list now contains four elements, where the fourth element is the result of the XOR operation between the third element and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
