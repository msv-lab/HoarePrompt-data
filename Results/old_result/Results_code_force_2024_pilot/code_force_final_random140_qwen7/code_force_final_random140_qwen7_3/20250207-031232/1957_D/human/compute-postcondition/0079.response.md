Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is 32, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1, `suf[j][1]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 32, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` and `j` remain unchanged, and since the condition `(cur >> j & 1)` was not specified to affect `suf[j][1]`, its value remains unchanged.
