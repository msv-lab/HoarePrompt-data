Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 2, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[1][0]` is unchanged, `suf[1][1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `suf[j][1]` by 1. Initially, `j` is 1, so `suf[1][1]` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `i`, `cur`, `suf[1][0]`, and the unchanged state of `j` are preserved.
