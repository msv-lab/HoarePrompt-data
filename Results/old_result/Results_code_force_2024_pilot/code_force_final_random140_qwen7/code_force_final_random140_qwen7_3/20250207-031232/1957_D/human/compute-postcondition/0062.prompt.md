Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 30, `j` is 64, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if cur >> j & 1:
        suf[j][1] += 1
    else:
        suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, and `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` represent the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`. If the least significant bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. If the least significant bit of `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 30, `j` is 2, `cur` is `prefix[30]`. If the bit at position `j` (which is the 2nd bit) of `cur` is 1, then `suf[1][1]` is incremented by 1. If the bit at position `j` is 0, then `suf[2][0]` is set to 1 and `suf[1][0]` and `suf[1][1]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 30, `j` is 3, `cur` is `prefix[30]`. If the result of `(cur >> j) & 1` is true, then `suf[3][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
