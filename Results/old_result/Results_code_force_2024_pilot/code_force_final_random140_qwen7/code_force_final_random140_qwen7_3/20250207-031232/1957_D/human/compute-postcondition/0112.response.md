Postcondition: `j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[1][0]` is 2, `suf[0][1]` is either unchanged or decremented by 1, and `suf[1][1]` is either unchanged, decreased by 1, or decreased by 2 depending on the value of `c` and `j`.

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
