You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `arr` contains the original list of integers, and `prefix` is a list of length equal to the number of elements in `arr` plus one. Each element in `prefix` (starting from the second one) is the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation on all the elements in `arr` up to that point in the sequence.

    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be reduced to 1 (since it starts at 31 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1). The variable `j` will reach 32 because the loop iterates over the range from 31 down to 1, and `j` is incremented within the inner loop. The variable `cur` will be the value of `prefix[1]` since `i` starts at 31 and decreases to 1. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will contain the counts of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, from the `j`-th bit to the most significant bit of `cur`.

    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `c` will have its highest bit set to 1, indicating it is a non-zero integer. The counts in `pre[31]` reflect that there are no zeros (since `pre[31][0]` is 0) and 32 ones across all bits up to the 31st bit. Similarly, `suf[31]` indicates that there are no additional zeros beyond the 31st bit (hence `-32` for `suf[31][0]`) and 32 ones (hence `-32` for `suf[31][1]`).

    #This is printed: ans (where ans is derived from the provided pre and suf arrays, specifically the counts of zeros and ones up to and beyond the 31st bit)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the condition \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \). The program calculates the prefix XOR values and uses bit manipulation to count the number of valid tuples, but it does not correctly evaluate the XOR condition for each tuple.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3
6 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

However, the program will produce an incorrect result. For example, the tuple (1, 2, 3) should be counted because:
- \( f(1, 2) = 6 \oplus 2 = 4 \)
- \( f(2, 3) = 2 \oplus 4 = 6 \)
- \( f(1, 3) = 6 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 0 \)

So, \( 4 \oplus 6 > 0 \) is true. However, the program might not correctly count this tuple due to its implementation issues.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
