Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 \cdot 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. The list d contains m integers such that 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9. The list f contains k integers such that 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]
    a = [*map(int, input().split())]
    b = [*map(int, input().split())]
    f = [*map(int, input().split())]
    gap = [(y - x, x, y) for y, x in zip(a[1:], a)]
    gap.sort(reverse=True)
    start = gap[0][1]
    end = gap[0][2]
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    nd = 0 if len(gap) == 1 else gap[1][0]
    b.sort()
    f.sort()
    res = inf
    for i in range(m):
        remain = mid - b[i]
        j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
        if j == k:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        else:
            s = f[j] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
            if j >= 1:
                s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
                if start < s < end:
                    res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    if res == inf:
        print(gap[0][0])
    else:
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `m` remains as the initial positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[m-1]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]`, and `res` is the minimum value found during the loop iterations of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` whenever the condition `start < s < end` is satisfied. Additionally, `res` is either infinity or the minimum value found under the specified condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All iterations of the loop have been executed, with `i` now equal to -1 since it starts at `m-1` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches -1. The value of `res` is infinity if no valid minimum value was found during any iteration where `start < s < end`, and `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]`. Otherwise, `res` holds the valid minimum value found during some iteration, and the variable `mid` has been adjusted in each iteration based on the value of `b[i]`. The values of `remain`, `j`, and `s` are determined within each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `res` will contain the minimum value among all the updates made during the iterations, whether `res` was initially infinity or a finite value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
