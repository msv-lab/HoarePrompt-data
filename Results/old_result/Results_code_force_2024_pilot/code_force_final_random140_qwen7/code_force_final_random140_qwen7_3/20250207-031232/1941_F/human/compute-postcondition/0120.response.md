Postcondition: `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` inserts `remain` to keep `f` sorted, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` is equal to `k`, and `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k` and `j` is not less than 1. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated accordingly; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
