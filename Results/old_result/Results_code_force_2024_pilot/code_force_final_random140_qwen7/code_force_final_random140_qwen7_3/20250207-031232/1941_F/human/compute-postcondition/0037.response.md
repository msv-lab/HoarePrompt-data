Postcondition: `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[0]` or `f[j] + b[0]` depending on whether `j` equals `k` or not, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and `res` is updated to the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if the condition `start < s < end` is met. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, `start`, `end`, and `res` remain unchanged.
