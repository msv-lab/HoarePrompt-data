Output State: **`start` is equal to the first element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`, `end` is equal to the third element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`, `mid` is equal to (`start` + `end`) // 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` is the sorted list of integers, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise it is the first element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `gap`, `res` is infinity (float('inf')).**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `res`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
