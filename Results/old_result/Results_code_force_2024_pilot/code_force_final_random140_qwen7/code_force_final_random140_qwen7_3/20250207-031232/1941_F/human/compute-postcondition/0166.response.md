Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input split and mapped to integers.**

This means that the user is expected to input three space-separated integers, which will be assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. Since the actual input values are not provided, the output state describes the action of assigning these integer values to the variables.
