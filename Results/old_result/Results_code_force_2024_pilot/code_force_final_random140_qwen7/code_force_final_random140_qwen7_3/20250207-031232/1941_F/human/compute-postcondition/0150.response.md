Postcondition: `mid` is decreased by `b[i]`, resulting in `remain`; `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted to keep list `f` sorted; `s` is the sum of `f[j]` and `b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, then `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If the condition `start < s < end` is not met, the values of `res`, `mid`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, and `f` remain unchanged.
