Postcondition: `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[0]`, `s` is `f[j] + b[0]`, and `res` is the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end - s` and `s - start`, with `nd` remaining unchanged.
