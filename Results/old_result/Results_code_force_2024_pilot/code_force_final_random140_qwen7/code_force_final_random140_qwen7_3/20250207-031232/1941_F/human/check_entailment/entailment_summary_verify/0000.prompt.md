You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving four lists (a, d, f) and three integers (n, m, k). It calculates and returns the minimum value that satisfies a specific condition. Specifically, it finds the smallest possible value of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` where `s` is the sum of an element from list `f` and an element from list `d`, and `start` and `end` are determined from list `a`. If no valid value is found, it returns the first gap value from list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where the new problem's complexity could potentially reduce the gap between the existing problems more effectively than just considering the immediate neighbors.

Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3
5 5 5
5 10 15 20 26
11 14 16 13 8
16 4 5 3 1
```

In this case, the initial gaps are:
- \(10 - 5 = 5\)
- \(15 - 10 = 5\)
- \(20 - 15 = 5\)
- \(26 - 20 = 6\)

The program sorts the gaps and considers the largest gap (6). It then tries to insert a new problem to minimize this gap. However, the program does not explore all possible combinations of models and functions to ensure the minimum possible gap.

For instance, with the model complexities \(d = [11, 14, 16, 13, 8]\) and function complexities \(f = [16, 4, 5, 3, 1]\), the program might not find the optimal solution. A better approach would be to consider all possible new problem complexities \(d_i + f_j\) and check which one minimizes the maximum gap.

A more comprehensive solution would involve generating all possible new problem complexities and then finding the minimum gap after inserting these new problems. This ensures that the program considers all potential ways to reduce the imbalance.
