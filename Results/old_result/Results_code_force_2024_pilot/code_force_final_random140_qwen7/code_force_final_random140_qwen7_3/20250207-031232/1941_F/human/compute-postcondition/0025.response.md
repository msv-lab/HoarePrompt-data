Output State: **`res` is the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end - s` and `s - start`, and `nd` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))` updates the value of `res` to be the minimum of its current value (`res`) and the maximum of three values: `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. The variables `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, and `s` are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain the same as the initial state. The value of `nd` is included in the max function but is not specified to be updated, so it remains unchanged.
