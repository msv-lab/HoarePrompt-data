Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, and `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]` depending on whether `j >= 1`. `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.
