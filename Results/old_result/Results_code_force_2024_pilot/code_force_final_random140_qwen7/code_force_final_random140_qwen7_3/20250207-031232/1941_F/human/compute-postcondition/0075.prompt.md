Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is equal to the first element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`, `end` is equal to the third element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`, `mid` is equal to (`start` + `end`) // 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` is the sorted list of integers, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise it is the first element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `gap`, `res` is infinity (float('inf')).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[0]` or `f[j] + b[0]` depending on whether `j` equals `k` or not, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and `res` is updated to the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if the condition `start < s < end` is met. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, `start`, `end`, and `res` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]`, and `res` is the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. If `start < s < end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]`, and `res` is the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. If `j == k`, then `j` remains unchanged and `res` remains unchanged. If `j != k`, then `j` is updated to the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` and `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
