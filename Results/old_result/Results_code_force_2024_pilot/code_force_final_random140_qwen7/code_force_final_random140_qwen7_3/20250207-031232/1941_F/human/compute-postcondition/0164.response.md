Postcondition: **All iterations of the loop have been executed, with `i` now equal to -1 since it starts at `m-1` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches -1. The value of `res` is infinity if no valid minimum value was found during any iteration where `start < s < end`, and `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]`. Otherwise, `res` holds the valid minimum value found during some iteration, and the variable `mid` has been adjusted in each iteration based on the value of `b[i]`. The values of `remain`, `j`, and `s` are determined within each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.**
