Postcondition: `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, and `res` is assigned the value of `min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))`. If `start < s < end` holds true, then `res` is updated to `min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))`. If the condition `start < s < end` does not hold, then `res` remains unchanged.
