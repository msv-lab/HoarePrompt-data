Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is set to infinity (inf), `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1 else `gap[1][0]`, `start` is equal to `gap[0][1]`, `total` is 10, `i` is `m-1`, `m` remains as the initial positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[m-1]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned the values from the input split into integers, `f` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `gap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difference between consecutive elements of `a` and the preceding element, `gap` is sorted in descending order, `end` is equal to `gap[0][2]`, `mid` is calculated as `(start + end) // 2`, `b` is sorted, `f` is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` inserts `remain` to keep `f` sorted, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` is equal to `k`, and `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k` and `j` is not less than 1. If `start < s < end`, `res` is further updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (`end - s`, `s - start`, `nd`), considering the following conditions: `i` is `m` (with `m` being greater than 0), `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` inserts `remain` to keep `f` sorted, and `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `j >= 1` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `mid` is decreased by `b[i]`, resulting in `remain`; `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted to keep list `f` sorted; `s` is the sum of `f[j - 1]` and `b[i]`. If `j == k`, then `s` is the sum of `f[j - 1]` and `b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is assigned the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `(end - s, s - start, nd)`. If `j >= 1` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `(end - s, s - start, nd)`. Otherwise, the values of `res`, `mid`, `remain`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
