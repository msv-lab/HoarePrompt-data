Postcondition: `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[0]` or `f[j] + b[0]` depending on whether `j` equals `k`, and `nd` remains unchanged. If `j` equals `k` and the condition `start < s < end` is met, `res` is updated to the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. If `j` does not equal `k` and `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and the condition `start < s < end` is met, `res` is assigned the minimum value between `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. If `j` is less than 1 or the condition `start < s < end` is not met, `res` remains unchanged.
