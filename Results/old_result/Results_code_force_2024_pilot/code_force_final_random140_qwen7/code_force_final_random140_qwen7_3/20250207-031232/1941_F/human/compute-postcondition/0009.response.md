Output State: **`start` is equal to the first element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`, `end` is equal to the third element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`, `mid` is equal to (`start` + `end`) // 2, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` is the same list of integers.**

This means that the variable `mid` has been calculated as the integer division of the sum of `start` and `end` by 2. The values of `start`, `end`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
