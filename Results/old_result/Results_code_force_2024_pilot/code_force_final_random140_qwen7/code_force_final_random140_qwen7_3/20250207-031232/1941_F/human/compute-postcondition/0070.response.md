Postcondition: `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and `res` is the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, and `res` remains unchanged if `start >= s` or `s >= end`.
