Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order according to the new `remain` value, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, and `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of the following expressions: 
- `end - (f[j - 1] + b[3])` if `start < f[j - 1] + b[3] < end`,
- `(f[j - 1] + b[3]) - start` if `start < f[j - 1] + b[3] < end`,
- `nd` if `start < f[j - 1] + b[3] < end`,
- `end - (f[j] + b[3])` if `start < f[j] + b[3] < end`,
- `(f[j] + b[3]) - start` if `start < f[j] + b[3] < end`,
- `nd` if `start < f[j] + b[3] < end`.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `res` is updated to the smallest value among the specified maximum expressions based on the conditions involving `start`, `end`, and the positions of `f[j - 1] + b[3]` and `f[j] + b[3]` within the range `[start, end)`.
