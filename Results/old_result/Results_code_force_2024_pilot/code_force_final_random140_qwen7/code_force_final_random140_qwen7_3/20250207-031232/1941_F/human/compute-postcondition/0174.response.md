Output State: **`start` is equal to the first element of the tuple in `gap` which is the difference between consecutive elements in `b` and the elements themselves, sorted in descending order; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers; `f` is the same list of integers; `gap` is a list of tuples each containing the difference between consecutive elements in `b` and the elements themselves sorted in descending order; `end` is equal to the third element of the first tuple in `gap`; `mid` is equal to (start + end) // 2.**

This means that the variable `mid` has been calculated as the integer division of the sum of `start` and `end` by 2. The values of `start`, `end`, `b`, `f`, and `gap` remain unchanged from their initial states.
