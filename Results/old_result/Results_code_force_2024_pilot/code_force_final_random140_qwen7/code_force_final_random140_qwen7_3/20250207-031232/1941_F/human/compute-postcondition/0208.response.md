Postcondition: `mid` is subtracted by `b[i]` to get `remain`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order, and `j` is not equal to `k`. The value of `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`, where `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` when `i` is 1 or the sum of `f[j - 1]` and `b[i]` when `i` is 0. If `start < s < end` does not hold, `res` remains unchanged.
