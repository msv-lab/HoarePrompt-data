Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are replaced by the list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. As a result, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are no longer holding their original integer values; instead, they are replaced by the list `a` which contains the integers obtained from the input.
