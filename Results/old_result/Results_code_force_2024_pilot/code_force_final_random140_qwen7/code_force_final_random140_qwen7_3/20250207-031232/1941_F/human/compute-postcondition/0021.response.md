Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `j` equals `k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and if `start < s < end`, then `res` is updated to the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, `start`, `end`, and `res` remain unchanged.**
