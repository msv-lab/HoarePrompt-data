Postcondition: `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `start < s < end`, or `f[j] + b[i]` if `j >= 1`, and `res` is the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` if `start < s < end`. If `j == k`, `j` is updated to the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` and `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. If `j < 1`, the values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, and `res` remain unchanged.
