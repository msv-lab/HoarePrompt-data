Output State: **`b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is now a sorted list of integers (same as `b`), `gap` is a list of tuples each containing the difference between consecutive elements in `b` and the elements themselves sorted in descending order, `end` is equal to the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is equal to (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1 else the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `start` is equal to the first element of the tuple in `gap` which is the difference between consecutive elements in `b` and the elements themselves, sorted in descending order, `res` is infinity.**

Explanation: The line `res = inf` assigns the value `inf` (infinity) to the variable `res`. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
