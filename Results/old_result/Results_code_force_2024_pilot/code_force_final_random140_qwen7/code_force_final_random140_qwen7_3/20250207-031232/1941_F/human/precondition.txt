t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The list a contains n integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 \cdot 10^9. The list d contains m integers where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9. The list f contains k integers where 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of k across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
