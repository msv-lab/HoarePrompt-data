Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are replaced by the list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. As a result, `n`, `m`, and `k` are no longer individual variables holding their original integer values; instead, they collectively represent the list `a` which contains the integers from the input. The specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k` individually are lost, but the collective state is now represented by the list `a`.
