Postcondition: **`res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (`end - s`, `s - start`, `nd`), considering the following conditions: `i` is `m` (with `m` being greater than 0), `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` inserts `remain` to keep `f` sorted, and `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `j >= 1` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
