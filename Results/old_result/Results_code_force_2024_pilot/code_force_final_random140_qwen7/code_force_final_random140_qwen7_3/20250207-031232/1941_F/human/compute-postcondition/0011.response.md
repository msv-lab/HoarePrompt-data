Output State: **`start` is equal to the first element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`, `end` is equal to the third element in the tuple at index 0 of the list `gap`, `mid` is equal to (`start` + `end`) // 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `f` is the same list of integers, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise it is the first element in the tuple at index 1 of the list `gap`**.

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The values of `start`, `end`, `mid`, `f`, and `nd` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated state of `b` being sorted while keeping the other variables as they were initially.
