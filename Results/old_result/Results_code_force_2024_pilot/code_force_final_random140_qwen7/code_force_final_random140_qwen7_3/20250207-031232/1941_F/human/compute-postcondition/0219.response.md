Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, `res` is assigned the value of `min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))` if `start < s < end`. If the condition `start < s < end` is not met, `res` remains unchanged.
