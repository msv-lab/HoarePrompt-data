Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, and `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (`end - s`, `s - start`, `nd`). Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when the condition `start < s < end` is not met.
