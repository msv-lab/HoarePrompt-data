Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input split and mapped to integers.**

This means that the initial state involves taking three space-separated integers as input from the user, which are then split into a list, and each element of the list is converted to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The exact values of these variables depend on the input provided by the user, but they are now holding those integer values.
