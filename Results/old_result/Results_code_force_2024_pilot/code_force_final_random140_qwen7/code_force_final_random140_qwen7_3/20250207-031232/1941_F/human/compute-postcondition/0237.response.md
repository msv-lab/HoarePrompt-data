Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted in list `f` to maintain sorted order according to the new `remain` value, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - (f[j] + b[3]), (f[j] + b[3]) - start, nd)` if `start < f[j] + b[3] < end`. If the condition `start < f[j] + b[3] < end` is not met, `res` remains unchanged.
