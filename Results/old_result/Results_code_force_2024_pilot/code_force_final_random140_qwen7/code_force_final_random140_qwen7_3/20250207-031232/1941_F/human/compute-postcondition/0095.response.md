Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(m):
   ```
   The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine Initial Value of `i`:**
   From the given state before the loop, we know that `i` is initially set to `m-1`.

3. **Determine Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. Since `i` starts at `m-1`, the loop will execute once when `i` is decremented to `m-2`.

4. **Adjust States:**
   - `i` should be adjusted to `m-1` because this is its initial value.
   - `m` should remain as the initial positive integer because it is used to define the range of the loop.

### Final State Adjustment:

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `m`. Given that `i` starts at `m-1`, the loop will execute exactly once.

### State Adjustment:

State: **`i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
