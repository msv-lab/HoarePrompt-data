Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `cnt0` is 1 more than its previous value, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt0` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1 more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
