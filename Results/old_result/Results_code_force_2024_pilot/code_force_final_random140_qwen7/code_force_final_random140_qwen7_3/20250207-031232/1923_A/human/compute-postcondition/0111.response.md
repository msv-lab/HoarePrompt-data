Postcondition: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 2, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`. Additionally, `cnt0` is incremented by 1 if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged.**
