Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 2, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`. Additionally, `cnt0` is equal to `cnt0` plus 1.**

Explanation: The line `cnt0 += 1` increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. The other variables (`idx`, `arrs`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
