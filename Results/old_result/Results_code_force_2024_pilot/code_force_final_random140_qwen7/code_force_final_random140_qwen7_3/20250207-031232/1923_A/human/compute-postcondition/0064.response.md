Output State: **After all iterations, `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the index `idx` will be equal to the last index of the list `arrs`. The list `arrs` will still contain at least one element. The variable `cnt1` will hold the total count of 1s present in the list `arrs`.
