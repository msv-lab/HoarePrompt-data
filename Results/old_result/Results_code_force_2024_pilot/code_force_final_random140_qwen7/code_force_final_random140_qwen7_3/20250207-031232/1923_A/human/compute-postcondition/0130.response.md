Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an index within the list, and the value of `arrs[idx]` is 1, `cnt1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt1` is incremented by 1, but the values of `arrs` and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `arrs[idx]` is still 1.
