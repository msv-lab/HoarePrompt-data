Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `idx` is equal to -1, the first element of `arrs` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `length = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `length`. The other variables (`ans`, `cnt1`, `idx`, the first element of `arrs`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
