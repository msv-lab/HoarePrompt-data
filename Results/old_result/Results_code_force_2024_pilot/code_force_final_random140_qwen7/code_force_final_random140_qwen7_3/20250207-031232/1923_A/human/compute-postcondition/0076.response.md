Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`; the first element of `arrs` is 0; `ans` is 0; if the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is reduced by 1; the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. Since no other operations are performed, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of all the variables mentioned in the initial state.
