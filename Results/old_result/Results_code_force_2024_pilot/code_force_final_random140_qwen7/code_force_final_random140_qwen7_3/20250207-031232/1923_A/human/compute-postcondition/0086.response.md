Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head uses `idx` and `len(arrs)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `idx` is initially set to the length of `arrs` minus 1.
   - `len(arrs)` is the length of the list `arrs`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `idx` is less than `len(arrs)`.
   - Initially, `idx` is set to `len(arrs) - 1`, so the loop will start with `idx` being one less than the length of `arrs`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `idx` should be set to `len(arrs) - 1`.
   - `arrs` should be a list of integers updated from user input.
   - `len(arrs)` should be the length of the updated list `arrs`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `idx`, `arrs`, and `len(arrs)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, len(arrs) is the length of the updated list `arrs`**
