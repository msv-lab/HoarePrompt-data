Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `idx` is equal to -1, and the first element of `arrs` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = cnt0` assigns the value of `cnt0` to `ans`. Since `cnt0` was not defined before and no value was explicitly given to it, its value remains unchanged from its initial state, which is 0. All other variables (`cnt1`, `idx`, and the first element of `arrs`) remain unchanged as well.
