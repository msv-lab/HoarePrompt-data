Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `idx` is equal to -1, and the first element of `arrs` is 0.**

The code simply initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cnt1`, `idx`, or the elements of `arrs`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `ans` being set to 0.
