Postcondition: `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 depending on the second element of `arrs`, and `idx` is 1. If the element at index `idx` in `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is set to 3. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 2.
