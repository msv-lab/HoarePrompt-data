Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `idx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of the length of the list `arrs`. This means `idx` will take values from 0 to `len(arrs) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arrs` is a list of integers.
   - `idx` is an index within the list.
   - If `arrs[idx]` equals 1, then `cnt1` is increased by 1.
   - If `arrs[idx]` does not equal 1, no change occurs to `cnt1`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `idx`**: Since `idx` is incremented at each iteration (it starts from 0 and goes up to `len(arrs) - 1`), the next value of `idx` will be the current value of `idx` plus 1.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `arrs` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `idx` will be `idx + 1`.
   - `cnt1` remains unchanged unless `arrs[idx]` equals 1 during the current iteration.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `arrs` remains the same.
- `idx` is incremented by 1.
- `cnt1` remains unchanged based on the condition in the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an index within the list that is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `cnt1` remains unchanged.**
