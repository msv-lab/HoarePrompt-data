Output State: **`idx` is 1; `cnt0` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cnt0` was 0 (implied by the context since no initial value is given and it's common to start counters at 0), so after executing `cnt0 += 1`, `cnt0` becomes 1. The value of `idx` remains unchanged at 1.
