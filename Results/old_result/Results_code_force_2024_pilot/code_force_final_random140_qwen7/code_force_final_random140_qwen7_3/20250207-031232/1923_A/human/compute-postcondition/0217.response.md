Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `idx`.
   - The loop iterates over the range of `len(arrs)`, meaning `idx` will take values from `0` to `len(arrs) - 1`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - `arrs` is a list of integers.
   - `idx` is an index within the list that must be less than `len(arrs)`.
   - `idx` must be equal to the current `idx + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `cnt1` is increased by 1 if the value at `arrs[idx]` is equal to 1.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `idx` must be equal to the current `idx + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, this means that `idx` was `len(arrs) - 1` in the previous iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `idx` will be `0` (the first index).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `arrs` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `idx` will be `0` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `cnt1` remains unchanged because the condition for incrementing `cnt1` (`arrs[idx] == 1`) would not be met when `idx` is `0` (since `idx` was `len(arrs) - 1` in the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is increased by 1 if the value at `arrs[0]` is equal to 1**.
