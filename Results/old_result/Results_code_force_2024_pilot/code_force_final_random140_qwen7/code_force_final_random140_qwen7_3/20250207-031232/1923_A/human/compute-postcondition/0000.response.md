Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and the number of consecutive 0s between the closest 1s on either side of each block of 1s is the answer.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet does not actually execute any operations to transform the list `a` into blocks of 0s and 1s or count the number of consecutive 0s between blocks of 1s. It only describes the goal and the structure of the problem. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from the initial state. The output state includes the description of what needs to be calculated, which is the number of consecutive 0s between the closest 1s on either side of each block of 1s.
