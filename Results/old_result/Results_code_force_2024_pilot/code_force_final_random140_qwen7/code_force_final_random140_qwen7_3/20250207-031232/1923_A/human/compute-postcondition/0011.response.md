Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `cnt0` is 1, the first element of `arrs` is 0, and `idx` is not 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cnt0 += 1` increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. Given that `cnt0` was initially 0, after executing this line, `cnt0` becomes 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
