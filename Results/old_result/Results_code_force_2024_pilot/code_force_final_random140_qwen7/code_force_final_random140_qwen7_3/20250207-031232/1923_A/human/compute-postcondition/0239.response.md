Output State: **After all iterations, `idx` will be equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `cnt1` will be the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`; `cnt0` will be the total number of 0s in the list `arrs` minus 1 if the last element of `arrs` is 0, or it will retain its initial value if the last element is 1; `ans` will be 0 if `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, otherwise `ans` will be `cnt0`.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop processes each input list `arrs` independently, counting the number of 0s and 1s, and adjusting the count of 0s based on specific conditions. After processing all inputs (`t` times), the final values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are used to determine `ans`.
