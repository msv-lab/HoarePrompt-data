Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`, the first element of `arrs` is 0, `idx` is not 0, and `cnt0` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Since `idx` was already equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1 and no other changes were made to `idx` or `arrs`, the conditions for these variables remain the same. The only change is that `cnt0` is now 1 because it was incremented from its previous value (which was 0).
