Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `cnt0` is equal to `cnt0` plus 1, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt0 += 1` increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. Since `idx` was initially set to the length of `arrs` minus 1, its value remains unchanged. The values of `arrs` and its length also remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
