Postcondition: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`; the first element of `arrs` is 0; `ans` is 0; if the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is reduced by 1; the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0.
