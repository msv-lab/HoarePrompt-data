Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`; the first element of `arrs` is 0; if the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `cnt0`; `t` is decreased by 1; `length` is an input integer.**

This means that the variable `length` has been assigned the value of an integer input, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
