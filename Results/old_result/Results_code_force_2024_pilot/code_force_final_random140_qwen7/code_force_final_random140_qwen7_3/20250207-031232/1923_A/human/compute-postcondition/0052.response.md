Output State: **`idx` is 0; `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements, and the first element of `arrs` is equal to 1; `cnt1` is 1.**

The code increments `cnt1` by 1. Initially, `cnt1` is 0, so after executing `cnt1 += 1`, `cnt1` becomes 1. The values of `idx` and `arrs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
