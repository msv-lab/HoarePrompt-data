You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers (0s and 1s). For each test case, it counts the number of 0s that are not adjacent to 1s and returns this count. If there is only one 1 or no 1s in the list, it returns 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the logic to count `cnt0` (the number of consecutive zeros) is flawed. The program incorrectly counts zeros that are not part of the initial segment of zeros, which can lead to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The correct output should be `1`, as moving the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell achieves the goal. However, the current implementation would incorrectly count the zeros and produce an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the segment of zeros that need to be moved and count only those zeros. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first chip
        start = None
        for i in range(length):
            if arrs[i] == 1:
                start = i
                break
        
        # Count the number of zeros to the left of the first chip
        cnt0 = 0
        for i in range(start):
            if arrs[i] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
        
        # Count the number of chips to the right of the first chip
        cnt1 = 0
        for i in range(start, length):
            if arrs[i] == 1:
                cnt1 += 1
        
        # The minimum number of operations is the number of zeros to the left of the first chip
        ans = cnt0
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the segment of zeros that need to be moved and counts only those zeros, ensuring the correct minimum number of operations is calculated.
