Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, and `cnt0` is the total count of zeros in the list `arrs`; `cnt1` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt1` to 0. The values of `arrs`, `t`, `length`, and `cnt0` remain unchanged from the initial state.
