Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `t`. The values of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
