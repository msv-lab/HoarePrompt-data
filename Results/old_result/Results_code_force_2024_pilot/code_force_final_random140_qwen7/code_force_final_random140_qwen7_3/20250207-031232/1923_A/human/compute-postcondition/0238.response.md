To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `idx` is 0.
2. `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`.
3. `cnt0` is either the initial value minus 1 (if the last element of `arrs` is 0) or retains its initial value (if the last element of `arrs` is not 0).
4. `ans` is either 0 or `cnt0` depending on whether `cnt1` equals 1 or 0.

Given these conditions, let's consider the possible scenarios for `cnt1` and how `ans` is determined:

- If `cnt1` equals 1, then `ans` is set to `cnt0`.
- If `cnt1` does not equal 1, then `ans` is set to 0.

Since the exact values of `arrs`, `cnt1`, and `cnt0` are not provided, we need to consider the general case where `cnt1` could be any non-negative integer.

However, the key point here is the value of `ans` based on the conditions provided. Since the exact values of `arrs`, `cnt1`, and `cnt0` are not specified, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the conditions given.

Given the conditions, `ans` will either be `cnt0` if `cnt1` is 1, or 0 otherwise. Without loss of generality, we can say that `ans` will be one of these two values based on the conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0 or cnt0 (where cnt0 is the initial value minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 0, or retains its initial value if the last element of arrs is not 0)**
