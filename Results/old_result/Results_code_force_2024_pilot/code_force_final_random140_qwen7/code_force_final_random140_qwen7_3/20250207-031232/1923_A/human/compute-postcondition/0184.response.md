Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `idx = 0` to `idx < len(arrs)`. 

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `arrs` must have at least one element.
   - If `arrs[0]` is 1, then there is no change in the state.
   - If `arrs[0]` is 0, then `cnt0` is incremented by 1.

4. **Analyze what happens in the next iteration**:
   - Since `idx` starts at 0 and the loop increments `idx` by 1 each time, the next value of `idx` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `arrs` must still have at least one element (which it does, as stated in the postcondition).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `idx` will be incremented to 1.
   - `arrs` remains the same (it must still have at least one element).
   - The value of `arrs[0]` determines whether `cnt0` changes or not, but since we are only asked to adjust the states in the loop head, we do not need to specify the exact value of `arrs[0]` or `cnt0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`idx` is 1, `arrs` must have at least one element**.
