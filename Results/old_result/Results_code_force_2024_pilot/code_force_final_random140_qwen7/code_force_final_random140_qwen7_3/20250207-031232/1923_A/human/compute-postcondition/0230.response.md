Output State: **`idx` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `cnt0` is either the initial value minus 1 (if the last element of `arrs` is 0) or retains its initial value (if the last element of `arrs` is not 0), and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables (`idx`, `cnt1`, and `cnt0`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states from the precondition.
