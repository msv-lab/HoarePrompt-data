Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `idx` is equal to -1, the first element of `arrs` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The line `cnt0 = 0` initializes the variable `cnt0` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `cnt1`, `idx`, the first element of `arrs`, `t`, `length`, or the list `arrs` itself. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
