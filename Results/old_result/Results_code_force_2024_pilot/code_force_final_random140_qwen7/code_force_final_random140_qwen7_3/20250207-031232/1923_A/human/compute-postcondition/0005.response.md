Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt0` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cnt0` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `length`, or `arrs`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
