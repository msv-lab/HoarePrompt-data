Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an index within the list such that the value at `arrs[idx]` is equal to 1, `cnt1` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cnt1` by 1. Since `idx` was previously an index within `arrs` such that `arrs[idx]` equals 1, this condition remains unchanged. The value of `arrs` and `idx` stay the same, but `cnt1` is now one more than its previous value.
