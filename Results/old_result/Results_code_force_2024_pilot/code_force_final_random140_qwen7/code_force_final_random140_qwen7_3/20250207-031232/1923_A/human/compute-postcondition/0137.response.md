Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `idx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of the length of `arrs`, meaning `idx` will take values from `0` to `len(arrs) - 1`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `arrs` is a list of integers.
   - `idx` is an index within the list.
   - `cnt1` is increased by 1 if `arrs[idx]` equals 1.

4. **Analyze the Postcondition**:
   - After the previous iteration, `idx` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `cnt1` is increased by 1 if `arrs[idx]` equals 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

5. **Calculate the New Value of `idx`**:
   - Since `idx` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `idx` will be the current value of `idx` plus 1.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - The state of `arrs` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - The state of `idx` needs to be adjusted to the new value, which is the current value of `idx` plus 1.
   - The state of `cnt1` remains unchanged unless `arrs[idx]` equals 1, but since we are only asked to adjust the state based on the loop head, we do not change `cnt1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `idx`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an index within the list that is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `cnt1` remains unchanged.** 

In terms of specific values:
- `idx` will be the current value of `idx` + 1.
- `cnt1` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

So, if the current value of `idx` is \( k \), then at the start of the next iteration, `idx` will be \( k + 1 \).
