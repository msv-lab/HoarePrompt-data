You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers (0s and 1s). For each test case, it counts the number of 0s that are not adjacent to 1s and returns this count. If there is only one 1 or no 1s in the list, it returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to move chips to form a single block without any free cells between them using the minimum number of operations. An operation involves moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `length` and the array `arrs` representing the cells.
   - It initializes `cnt0` to count the number of consecutive zeros starting from the first cell.
   - It initializes `cnt1` to count the number of chips (1s) in the array.
   - The logic to count `cnt0` is flawed. It should only count the zeros between the first chip (if present) and the end of the array. The current implementation counts zeros even before the first chip, which is incorrect.
   - The logic to handle the edge case where the first cell is zero and the last cell is also zero is incorrect. It subtracts one from `cnt0`, but this does not necessarily reflect the correct count of gaps.
   - The final answer is calculated as the number of zeros (`cnt0`) between the first chip and the end of the array. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the optimal way to move chips.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the first and last positions of chips (1s).
   - Count the number of zeros between these positions. This will give the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips together.

4. **Corrected Code**:
   ```python
   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           length = int(input())
           arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
           
           # Find the first and last positions of chips
           first_chip = None
           last_chip = None
           for i in range(length):
               if arrs[i] == 1:
                   if first_chip is None:
                       first_chip = i
                   last_chip = i
           
           # Calculate the number of zeros between the first and last chip
           cnt0 = 0
           for i in range(first_chip, last_chip + 1):
               if arrs[i] == 0:
                   cnt0 += 1
           
           print(cnt0)
   ```

Based on the analysis, the original code is incorrect due to flawed logic in counting zeros and handling edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
