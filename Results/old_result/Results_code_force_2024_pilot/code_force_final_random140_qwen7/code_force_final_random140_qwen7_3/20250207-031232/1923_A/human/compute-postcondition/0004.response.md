Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `arrs`. The initial conditions for `t` and `length` remain unchanged.
