Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arrs` using `range(len(arrs))`. This means `idx` will take values from 0 to `len(arrs) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements.
   - `cnt1` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the next value of `idx`**: Since `idx` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `idx` would be 2.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `idx` must be less than `len(arrs)`. Given that `idx` is currently 1, it will continue to the next iteration where `idx` will be 2.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `idx` will be 2.
   - `arrs` must still be a list with more than 0 elements (no change needed here as it was already true).
   - `cnt1` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `idx` is 2, `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements, and `cnt1` remains unchanged.**
