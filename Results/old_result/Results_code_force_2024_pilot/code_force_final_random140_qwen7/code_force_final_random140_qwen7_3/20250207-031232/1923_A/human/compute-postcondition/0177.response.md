Output State: **`idx` is 0, `arrs` must have at least one element, and `arrs[0]` is equal to 0; `cnt0` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cnt0` was 0. After executing `cnt0 += 1`, `cnt0` becomes 1. The other variables (`idx` and `arrs`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
