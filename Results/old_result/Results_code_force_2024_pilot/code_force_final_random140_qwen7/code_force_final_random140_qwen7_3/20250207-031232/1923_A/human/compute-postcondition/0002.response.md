Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `_`, but since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any specific value, we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Identify the variables that affect the loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer and the condition is \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
