Output State: **`idx` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, `cnt0` is either the initial value minus 1 (if the last element of `arrs` is 0) or retains its initial value (if the last element of `arrs` is not 0), and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `idx`, `cnt1`, `cnt0`, or the list `arrs`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
