Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements.
2. The first element of `arrs` is 0.
3. `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`.
4. `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1.
5. If the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, then `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `cnt0`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the value of `ans`:

- Since `arrs` has more than 0 elements and the first element is 0, there must be at least one other element in the list.
- `cnt1` is the count of 1s in the list. If `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is `cnt0`.

However, `cnt0` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. To determine `ans`, we need to consider the possible values of `cnt1`:

- If `cnt1` is 0, then `ans` is 0.
- If `cnt1` is 1, then `ans` is 0.
- If `cnt1` is greater than 1, then `ans` would be `cnt0`. But since `cnt0` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, the problem states that if `cnt1` is not 1 or 0, `ans` is `cnt0`. Given the lack of additional information about `cnt0`, we assume it is not defined or irrelevant for this specific case.

Since the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact value of `cnt0`, and based on the conditions given, the only certain values for `ans` are when `cnt1` is 0 or 1, both of which make `ans` equal to 0.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0**
