Output State: **After all iterations, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in the list `arrs`, and `cnt0` retains its initial value as it is not affected by the loop.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through the list `arrs` starting from the last index and moving towards the first index. For each index, it increments `cnt1` if the value at that index is 1. Once the loop completes, `idx` will be set to 0 because the loop continues until `idx` is no longer a valid index (i.e., it becomes negative). The variable `cnt0` is not mentioned in the loop and is only incremented based on conditions outside the loop, so its value remains unchanged.
