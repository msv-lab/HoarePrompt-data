Output State: **`idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1; `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements; `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in the list `arrs`; the first element of `arrs` is 0; `ans` is 0; if the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is reduced by 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `idx`, `arrs`, `cnt1`, or `cnt0`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only new information is that `ans` is now 0.
