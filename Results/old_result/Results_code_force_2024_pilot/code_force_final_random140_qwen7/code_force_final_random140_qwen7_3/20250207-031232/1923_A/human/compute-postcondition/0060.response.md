Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `idx` is 1
   - `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements
   - `cnt1` remains unchanged
   - If `arrs[idx]` equals 1, then `cnt1` becomes 2.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for idx in range(len(arrs)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arrs`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `idx` must be incremented to the next value within the range of `len(arrs)`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `idx`:**
   - Since `idx` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `idx` would be 2 (assuming `arrs` has at least 2 elements).

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `idx` will be incremented to 2.
   - `arrs` remains the same as it is a list with more than 0 elements.
   - `cnt1` remains unchanged unless `arrs[2]` equals 1, but since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we do not change `cnt1` here.

6. **Final State:**
   - `idx` is 2
   - `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements
   - `cnt1` remains unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**State: **`idx` is 2, `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements, and `cnt1` remains unchanged**.
