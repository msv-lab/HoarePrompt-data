Postcondition: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`. If `arrs[idx]` is equal to 0, then `cnt0` is incremented by 1. If `arrs[idx]` is not equal to 0, then `cnt0` remains unchanged.
