Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `idx`.
   - The list being iterated over is `arrs`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements.
   - If the first element of `arrs` is equal to 1, then `cnt1` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `idx` is currently 0, the loop will increment `idx` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `idx` will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `arrs` must still have more than 0 elements.
   - The value of `cnt1` will depend on the value of the first element of `arrs`:
     - If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt1` will remain 1.
     - If the first element of `arrs` is not 1, `cnt1` will remain unchanged (which could be 0 or any other initial value).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `idx` is 1.
- `arrs` must have more than 0 elements.
- `cnt1` will remain as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`idx` is 1, `arrs` is a list with more than 0 elements, `cnt1` remains unchanged.**
