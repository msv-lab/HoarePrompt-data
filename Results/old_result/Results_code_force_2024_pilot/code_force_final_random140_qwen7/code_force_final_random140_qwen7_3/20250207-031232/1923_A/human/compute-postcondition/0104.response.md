Postcondition: `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1, `arrs` is a list of integers updated from user input, and the length of `arrs` is the length of the updated list `arrs`. Additionally, if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is equal to 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then `cnt0` remains unchanged. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `arrs[idx]` is 1 and `cnt0` is incremented by 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is not 1, no changes are made to `arrs` and `cnt0`.
