Output State: **`cnt1` is 0, `cnt0` is unchanged, `idx` is the length of `arrs` minus 1, `ans` is undefined, `t` is decremented by 1, and `arrs` is the updated list of integers from user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `cnt1` to 0. It does not modify `cnt0`, `idx`, `ans`, `t`, or `arrs` in any way. The value of `idx` remains as the length of `arrs` minus 1, and `t` is decremented by 1. `arrs` is updated from user input, but no further operations are performed on it. Since no conditions or loops are present in the given snippet, the values of `cnt0` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
