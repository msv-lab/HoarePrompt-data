Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `cnt0` is either 2 or 3 depending on the second element of `arrs`, and `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt0` was initially either 1 or 2 (depending on the second element of `arrs`). After executing `cnt0 += 1`, `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `cnt0` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 2, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
