Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Counting of Zeros**: The code counts zeros in a way that doesn't correctly reflect the need to move chips to the leftmost possible position. Specifically, it counts zeros starting from the first element, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Logic for Counting Zeros**: The logic for counting zeros should focus on finding the number of consecutive zeros that separate blocks of ones. This is because each block of zeros represents an obstacle that needs to be overcome by moving chips to the left.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when there are multiple blocks of ones separated by zeros.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the index of the last chip
        last_chip_index = None
        for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):
            if arrs[i] == 1:
                last_chip_index = i
                break
        
        # Count the number of zeros to the left of the last chip
        cnt0 = 0
        for i in range(last_chip_index):
            if arrs[i] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
        
        print(cnt0)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version finds the index of the last chip and then counts the number of zeros to the left of this index, which gives the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.
