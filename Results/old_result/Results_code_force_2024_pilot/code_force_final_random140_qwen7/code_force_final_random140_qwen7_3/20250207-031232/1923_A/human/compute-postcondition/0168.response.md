Output State: **`idx` is not 0, `arrs` must have at least one element, and the first element of `arrs` is 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Since `idx` is not 0, `arrs` has at least one element, and the first element of `arrs` is 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is still 0. After executing the code, `cnt0` is updated to 1.
