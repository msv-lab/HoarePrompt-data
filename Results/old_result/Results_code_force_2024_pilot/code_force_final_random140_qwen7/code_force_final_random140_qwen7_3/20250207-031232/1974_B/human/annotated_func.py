#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the described algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    char_map = {char: r[-i - 1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` where each character is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of the string `r` as per the mapping in `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns another string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of a reference string `r` according to a given `char_map`.
