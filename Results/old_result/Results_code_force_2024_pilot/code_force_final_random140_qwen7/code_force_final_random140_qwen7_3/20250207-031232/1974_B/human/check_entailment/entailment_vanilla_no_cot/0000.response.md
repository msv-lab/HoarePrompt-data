Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the decoding logic based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into parts, correctly handling multiple test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself).
3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - It first finds all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - It creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`.
   - It uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string by replacing each character according to the mapping.
4. **Output**: The decoded strings are stored and printed out in the correct format.

Given that the logic accurately reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
