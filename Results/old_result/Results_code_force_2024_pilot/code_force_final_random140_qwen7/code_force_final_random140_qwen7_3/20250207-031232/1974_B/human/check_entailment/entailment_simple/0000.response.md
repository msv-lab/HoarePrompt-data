Reasoning:
1. The program reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
3. The function `func_1` is designed to decode the string based on the encoding rules provided.
4. `unique_chars` is derived from the encoded string, ensuring all unique characters are considered.
5. The `r` string is constructed by sorting these unique characters alphabetically.
6. A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `r` to its corresponding character from the end of `r`.
7. The `decoded` string is generated by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from `char_map`.
8. The logic in `func_1` accurately reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding logic as specified.

Correctness: **True**
