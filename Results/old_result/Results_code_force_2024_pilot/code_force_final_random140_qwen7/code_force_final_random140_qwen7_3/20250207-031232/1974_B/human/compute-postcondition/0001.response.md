Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`; `r` is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `unique_chars`.**

Explanation: The code `r = ''.join(unique_chars)` creates a new string `r` by joining all the elements in the list `unique_chars`. Since `unique_chars` contains the sorted unique characters from `encoded`, `r` will be a string formed by concatenating these unique characters in sorted order. The lengths and types of `encoded` and `unique_chars` remain unchanged.
