Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`; `r` is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `unique_chars`; `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each character in `r` to its corresponding character from the end of `r`; `decoded` is a string where each character is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `r` as per the mapping in `char_map`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new string `decoded` by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from the end of the string `r` using the `char_map` dictionary. The values of `encoded`, `unique_chars`, `r`, and `char_map` remain unchanged.
