Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
3. The `func_1` function is responsible for decoding the string:
   - It first creates a string `r` containing all unique characters from the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its corresponding character from the end of `r`.
   - Finally, it uses this map to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from `r`.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct logic for decoding the string. The steps taken in the `func_1` function match the described encoding process but in reverse.

Therefore, the program should work correctly based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
