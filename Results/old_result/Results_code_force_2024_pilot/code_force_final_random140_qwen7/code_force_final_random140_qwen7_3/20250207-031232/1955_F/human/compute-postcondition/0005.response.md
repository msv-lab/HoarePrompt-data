Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into four space-separated integers, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `i` is still less than `t` is maintained.
