Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are `i` and the value used to generate the range, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. 

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` (which is `int(input())`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is the upper limit for the range.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`. However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we focus on adjusting `t` to ensure the loop continues. The loop will continue as long as `i < t`, so `t` remains the same unless the user inputs a new value, but since no new input is mentioned, `t` stays the same.

5. **State adjustment**: Since `t` is the upper limit for the range and it does not change within the loop, we only need to update `i` to `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can only express it in terms of the initial conditions and the fact that `i` will be incremented by 1.

So, the final state can be expressed as:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `i + 1`**.
