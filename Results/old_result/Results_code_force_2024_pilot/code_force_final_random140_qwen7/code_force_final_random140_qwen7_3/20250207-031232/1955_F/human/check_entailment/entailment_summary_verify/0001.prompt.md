You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total count of even numbers (1s and 2s divided by 2) plus a special condition based on the remainders when dividing the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s by their respective values. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, which means we need to maximize the number of times the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. 

### Given Program Analysis
The provided function `func()` reads the input and calculates a value using the formula:
\[ \text{result} = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 3 == 3) \]

Here’s what each part of the formula does:
1. **Floor Division**: `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, `d // 2` count how many pairs of each type of number (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s) can be removed without changing the parity (odd/even nature) of the count.
2. **Modulo Operation**: `a % 2`, `b % 2`, `c % 3` check the remaining counts modulo 2 and 3, respectively. The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` checks if the sum of these counts, when taken modulo 3, equals 3, which would mean that removing one more number could make the XOR zero.

### Correctness Check
To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that the formula correctly maximizes the number of Bob's wins. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Floor Division**: Removing pairs of numbers ensures that the parity of the counts remains the same, thus not affecting the possibility of making the XOR zero.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` ensures that the sum of the remaining counts, when taken modulo 3, is 3. This implies that there are enough odd counts to potentially make the XOR zero after removing one more number.

Given this analysis, the formula seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of Bob's wins by ensuring that the XOR remains zero as much as possible.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
