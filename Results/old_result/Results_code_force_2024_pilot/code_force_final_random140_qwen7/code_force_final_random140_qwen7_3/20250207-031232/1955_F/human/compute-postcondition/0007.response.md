Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the input value used to determine the range of the loop.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than the integer value entered by the user.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration and is now less than `t`, it will be incremented again for the next iteration.
   - The input value for the range will remain the same unless the user provides a new input, but since no new input is mentioned, we assume it remains the same.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 again, making it `i + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k` before, it will be `k + 1` in the next iteration. Since `i` is currently less than `t`, it will still be less than `t` after incrementing.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`.**
