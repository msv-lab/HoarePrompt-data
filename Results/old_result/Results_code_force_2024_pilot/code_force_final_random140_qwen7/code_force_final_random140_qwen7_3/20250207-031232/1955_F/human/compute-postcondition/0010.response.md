Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, i equals t, and a, b, c, and d are integers obtained from the input split by spaces for the last iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10,000, as it was initially set. The variable `i` will equal `t` because the loop condition `i < t` will no longer be true once `i` has been incremented `t` times. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will be the integers obtained from the input split by spaces for the last iteration of the loop, as these values are redefined with each iteration but do not persist outside of the loop.
