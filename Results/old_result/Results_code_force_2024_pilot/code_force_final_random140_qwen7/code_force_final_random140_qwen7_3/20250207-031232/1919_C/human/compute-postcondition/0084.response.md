Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(a)`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches the length of `a`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `a` must have at least one element
   - `b` is an empty list
   - The condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` must hold, where `a[2] > a[1]`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - The condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` must still hold, which means `a[3] > a[2]` must be true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - The condition `a[3] > a[2]` must hold for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be 3.
- The condition `a[3] > a[2]` must hold.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is 1, `i` is 3, `a` must have at least one element, `b` is an empty list, and `a[3] > a[2]` must hold.**
