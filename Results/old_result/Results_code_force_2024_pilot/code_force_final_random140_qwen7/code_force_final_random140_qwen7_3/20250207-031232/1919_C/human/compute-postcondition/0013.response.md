Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i + 1` in `lit`, `b` includes the element `lit[i]` and `b` has appended the element `lit[i]`.**

This means that the list `b` has had its last element updated to include the value of `lit[i]`. The other conditions and the nature of the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
