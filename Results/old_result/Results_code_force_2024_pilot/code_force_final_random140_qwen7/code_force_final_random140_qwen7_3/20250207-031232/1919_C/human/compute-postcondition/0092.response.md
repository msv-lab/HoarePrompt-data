Output State: **s is 2, i is n, a contains the first element of lit followed by all elements from lit that are greater than their preceding elements in lit, and b is an empty list.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `s` will be incremented each time an element in the list `a` is found to be greater than its preceding element. Since the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `len(a) - 1`, it will check each element in `a` against its predecessor. Based on the provided information, the loop has executed up to the third iteration, meaning that two elements in `a` have been found to be greater than their preceding elements, so `s` is 2. The variable `i` will be `len(a)` after the loop completes, as the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of `a`. The list `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements, and `b` will remain an empty list since no elements were added to it within the loop.
