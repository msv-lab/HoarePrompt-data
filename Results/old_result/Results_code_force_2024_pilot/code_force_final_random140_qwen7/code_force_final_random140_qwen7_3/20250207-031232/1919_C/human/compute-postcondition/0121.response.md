Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is `n + 4`, `cp` is 0, `a` is `[lit[0], lit[i]]`, `b` has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, `lit` is updated to a list of integers based on user input, and `a[-1]` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Initially, `a` was `[lit[0]]`, so after appending `lit[i]`, `a` becomes `[lit[0], lit[i]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
