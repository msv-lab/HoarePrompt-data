Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 1; `b` contains the element `lit[2]`.**

The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 2, `b` will contain the element `lit[2]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
