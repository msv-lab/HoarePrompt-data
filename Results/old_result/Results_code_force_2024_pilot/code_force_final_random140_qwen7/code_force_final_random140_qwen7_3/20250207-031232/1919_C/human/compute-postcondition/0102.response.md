Postcondition: `s` is 4, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` must have at least 1 element, and if the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`, then no change is needed. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then the condition remains as is.
