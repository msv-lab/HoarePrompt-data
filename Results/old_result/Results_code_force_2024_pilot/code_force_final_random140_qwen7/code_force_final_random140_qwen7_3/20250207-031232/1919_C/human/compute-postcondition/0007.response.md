Output State: **`a` is a list of integers. The last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`. `b` is a list that now includes the element `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `b`. Since the initial state mentions that `a` is a list of integers and the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `b` now contains the element `lit[i]`.
