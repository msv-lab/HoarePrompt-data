Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [lit[0]], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[-1] < lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        else:
            a.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is equal to the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element, and `i` is equal to `len(b)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `s` is equal to `n + 3`, `i` is `len(b)`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, and the loop has executed until `i` is equal to the length of `b`.

In this final state, the variable `s` has incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, starting from 2 (as given in the initial state). Since the loop runs for `n` iterations (based on the provided output states), `s` ends up being `n + 3`. The variable `i` reaches the length of `b` after all iterations. The lists `a` and `b` retain their structures as described, with `a` containing elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements, and `b` having been fully iterated over according to the loop's conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: total is 0, s is n + 15, cp is 0, i is 7.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(b) - 1`. We know that after 3 iterations, `s` is `n + 12`. This means that the condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` was met 3 times. Each subsequent iteration will increment `s` by 1 as long as the condition continues to hold true. Since the loop runs until `i = len(b) - 1`, and we have already completed 3 iterations with `i` being 6, there are `len(b) - 7` more iterations. If the condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` holds true for all these remaining iterations, `s` will be incremented by the number of these iterations. However, without knowing the exact length of `b`, we assume that the condition continues to hold true for all remaining iterations. Thus, if there are `k` more iterations, `s` will be `n + 12 + k`. Given that `i` is 7 after 3 iterations, and assuming the loop runs until `i = len(b) - 1`, if `len(b)` is the minimum possible value that allows for 3 iterations (which is 7), then there would be no more iterations. But considering the general case where `len(b)` could be larger, we assume the condition holds true for all remaining iterations, leading to `s` being `n + 15` after all iterations. The other variables (`total`, `cp`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
