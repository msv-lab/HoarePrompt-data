Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences. The issue lies in the logic used to split the array into subsequences `a` and `b`. Specifically, the program only considers increasing sequences and does not explore all possible ways to split the array to minimize the penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

The program's output would be:
```
3
```

However, the optimal split would be `s = [1, 3, 5]` and `t = [2, 4, 6]`, resulting in a penalty of `2 + 1 = 3`. But another valid and optimal split is `s = [1, 2, 3]` and `t = [4, 5, 6]`, which also results in a penalty of `2 + 1 = 3`.

The program's logic only considers appending elements to `a` if they are greater than the last element of `a`, and appending to `b` otherwise. This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty because it does not explore all possible splits.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible splits and choose the one that minimizes the penalty. One way to achieve this is by using dynamic programming or a more exhaustive search approach to evaluate all possible splits.
