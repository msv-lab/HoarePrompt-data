Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is 2, i is n, a contains the first element of lit followed by all elements from lit that are greater than their preceding elements in lit, and b is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is 3, `i` is n, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` must have at least 1 element, and if the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`, then no change is needed. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then the condition remains as is.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is 4, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` must have at least 1 element, and if the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`, then no change is needed. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then the condition remains as is.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is 5, `i` is `n + 2`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` must have at least 1 element, and if the current value of `b[i]` (which is `b[n + 2]`) is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[n + 1]`), then no change is needed. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then the condition remains as is.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
