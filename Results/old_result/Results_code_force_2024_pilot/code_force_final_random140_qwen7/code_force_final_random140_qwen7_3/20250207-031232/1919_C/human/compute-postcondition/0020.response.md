Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list that includes the element `lit[i + 1]`. If the last element of `a` is less than `lit[i]`, then `b` will also include the element `lit[i]`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` will be replaced by `lit[i]`, and `b` will still include the element `lit[i]`.
