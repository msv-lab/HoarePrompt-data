Postcondition: `s` is 2, `i` is 3, `a` must have at least one element, `b` is an empty list, and `a[3] > a[2]` must hold.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `s` will be 2, `i` will be 3, `a` must contain at least one element, `b` remains an empty list, and the condition `a[3] > a[2]` must be satisfied.
