Output State: **`lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `s` is equal to the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element, `i` is equal to `len(b) + 1`, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `lit`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
