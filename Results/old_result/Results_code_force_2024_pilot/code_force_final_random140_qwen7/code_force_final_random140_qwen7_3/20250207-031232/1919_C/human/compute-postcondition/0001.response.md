Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the value of `n` will also be within this range. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the precondition specifies its value and no operation modifies it.
