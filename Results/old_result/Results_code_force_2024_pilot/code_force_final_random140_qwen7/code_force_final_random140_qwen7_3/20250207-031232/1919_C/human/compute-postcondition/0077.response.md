Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, and `b` will be an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `a`, or `b`, which are described in the initial state. Therefore, the updated state only reflects the change in `s`.
