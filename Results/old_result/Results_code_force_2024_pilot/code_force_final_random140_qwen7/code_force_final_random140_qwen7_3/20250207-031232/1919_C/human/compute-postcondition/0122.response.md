Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is equal to `n + 4`, `cp` is 0, `a` is either `[lit[0]]` or `[lit[0], lit[i]]`, `b` has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, `lit` is updated to a list of integers based on user input, and `a[-1]` is less than `b[-1]` if the if part is executed, otherwise `a[-1]` is greater than or equal to `b[-1]`.**
