Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(a)`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `a` must have at least one element
   - `b` is an empty list
   - The condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` holds true (since `a[1] > a[0]`).

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - The condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` must still hold true for `i = 3`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - We need to ensure that `a[3] > a[2]` holds true for the loop to continue.

6. **Final state**:
   - `s` remains 1.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `a` must still have at least one element.
   - `b` remains an empty list.
   - The condition `a[3] > a[2]` must hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `s` is 1, `i` is 3, `a` must have at least one element, `b` is an empty list, and `a[3] > a[2]` must hold true.**
