Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is either `len(b) + 3` or `len(b) + 4`, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is equal to `n + 4`, `cp` is 0, `a` is one of the following: `[lit[0], lit[i-1]]` or `[lit[0], lit[i-1], lit[i]]`, `b` has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, `lit` is updated to a list of integers based on user input, and `a[-1]` is less than `b[-1]` if the if part is executed, otherwise `a[-1]` is greater than or equal to `b[-1]; a is appended with `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is either `len(b) + 3` or `len(b) + 4`, and `a` was previously either `[lit[0]]`, `[lit[0], lit[i-1]]`, or `[lit[0], lit[i-1], lit[i]]`, appending `lit[i]` to `a` results in `a` being one of the following: `[lit[0], lit[i-1]]` or `[lit[0], lit[i-1], lit[i]]` (if `a` was initially `[lit[0], lit[i-1]]`) or `[lit[0], lit[i-1], lit[i]]` (if `a` was initially `[lit[0], lit[i-1], lit[i]]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
