Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - The last element of `a` is either less than the element at index `i + 1` in `lit` or equal to `lit[i]`.
   - `b` includes the element `lit[i]` and may have appended the element `lit[i]` depending on the condition evaluated in the if statement.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, if the loop just finished an iteration with `i` being some value `k`, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state based on the new value of `i`**:
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant defined before the loop.

6. **Determine the new postconditions**:
   - The last element of `a` should now be compared with the element at index `i + 1` in `lit` (which is `i + 2` in the next iteration).
   - `b` should include the element `lit[i + 1]` (which is `lit[i + 2]` in the next iteration) and may have appended it depending on the condition evaluated in the if statement.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, the last element of `a` is either less than the element at index `i + 2` in `lit` or equal to `lit[i + 1]`. `b` includes the element `lit[i + 1]` and may have appended the element `lit[i + 1]` depending on the condition evaluated in the if statement.**
