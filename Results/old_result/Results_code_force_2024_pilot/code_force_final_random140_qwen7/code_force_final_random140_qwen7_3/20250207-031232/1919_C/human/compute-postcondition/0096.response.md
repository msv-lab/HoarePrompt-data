Output State: **`s` is 3, `i` is n, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` must have at least 1 element, and the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as the code snippet only modifies `s`.
