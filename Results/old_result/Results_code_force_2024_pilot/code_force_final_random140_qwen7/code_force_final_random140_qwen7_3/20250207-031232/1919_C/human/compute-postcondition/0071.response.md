Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, if `i` is currently 2, it will become 3 in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, and `i` becomes 3, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
