Postcondition: `s` is 3, `i` is n, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, and `b` must have at least 1 element. If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`, then no changes are made.
