Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: total is 0, s is `n + 9`, cp is 0, i is `len(b) + n + 3`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times as per the provided states, we can infer that `len(a)` is at least 4 (since `i` increments by 1 each time and starts from 1). After 3 iterations, `s` has increased by 1 each time the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` is met, starting from `n + 4` (as given in the initial state). Therefore, after 3 iterations, `s` would be `n + 4 + 3 = n + 7`. However, the problem statement shows `s` as `n + 7` after 3 iterations, which means the condition was met exactly 3 times. For the remaining iterations, the condition continues to hold true, so `s` will increment by 1 for each additional iteration. Since the loop runs until `i = len(a) - 1`, and we know it has already run 3 times, there are `len(a) - 4` more iterations. Assuming `len(a)` is the minimum possible value (4), there would be 1 more iteration, making `s` equal to `n + 8`. But since the exact number of iterations is not specified beyond the first 3, we consider the general case where `len(a)` could be larger, leading to `s` being `n + 9` after all iterations. The other variables (`total`, `cp`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `s` is `n + 10`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 4, `len(b)` must be at least 5, and if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, the condition holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 0, `s` is `n + 11`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 5, `len(b)` must be at least 6. If `b[5]` is greater than `b[4]`, the condition remains as is; otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `s` is `n + 12`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 6. If `b[6]` is greater than `b[5]`, then the values remain unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
