Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with its last element now being equal to `lit[i]`, `lit` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially a list of integers and the last element of `a` was already greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `lit` at index `i`, appending `lit[i]` to `a` updates the last element of `a` to `lit[i]`. The list `lit` remains unchanged.
