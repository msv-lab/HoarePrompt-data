Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with its last element now being equal to `lit[i]`, `b` includes the element `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This means the last element of `a` is now `lit[i]`. The variable `b` already includes the element `lit[i]`, so no change is made to `b`.
