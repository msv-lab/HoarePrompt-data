Postcondition: `s` is 1, `i` is 3, `a` must have at least one element, `b` is an empty list, and either `a[3] > a[2]` holds or the condition does not trigger (meaning `a[3] <= a[2]`).

Explanation: The if statement checks if `a[i] > a[i - 1]` where `i` is 3. If the condition is true, then `s` becomes 2, indicating that the element at index 3 is greater than the element at index 2. If the condition is false, then `s` remains 1, and the condition `a[3] > a[2]` does not hold. The value of `i` is set to 3 in both cases, and `b` remains an empty list.
