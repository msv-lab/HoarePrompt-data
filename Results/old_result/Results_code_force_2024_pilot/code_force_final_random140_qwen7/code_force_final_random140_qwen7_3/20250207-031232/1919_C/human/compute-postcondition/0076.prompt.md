Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `s` is equal to the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element, `i` is equal to `len(b) + 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. If the last element of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` in list `lit`, then list `b` has appended the element at index `i` from list `lit`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `a` now has an additional element which is `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. If the last element of array `a` is less than `lit[2]`, then `a` does not change. Otherwise, `a` contains the element `lit[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 3. If the last element of array `a` is less than `lit[3]`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, `a` contains the element `lit[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
