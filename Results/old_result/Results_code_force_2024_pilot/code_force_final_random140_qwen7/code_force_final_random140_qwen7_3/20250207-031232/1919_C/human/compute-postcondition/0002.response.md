Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the resulting map object to a list. The list `lit` is created with these integer values. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
