Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `b` (exclusive).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is 3
   - `i` is `n` (which was `i` from the previous iteration)
   - `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`
   - `b` must have at least 1 element
   - If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`, no change is needed. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, the condition remains as is.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 1`.
   - `b` must still have at least 1 element, and the condition regarding `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` remains 3
   - `i` is now `n + 1`
   - `a` remains unchanged
   - `b` must still have at least 1 element
   - The condition regarding `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` remains the same

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`s` is 3, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` must have at least 1 element, and if the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`, then no change is needed. If `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`, then the condition remains as is.**
