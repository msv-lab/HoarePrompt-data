Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is equal to `n + 3`
   - `i` is `len(b)`
   - `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`
   - `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, and the loop has executed until `i` is equal to the length of `b`

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations based on the provided output states.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - Since the loop has already run for `n` iterations, `s` has incremented by 1 for each iteration, starting from 2. Therefore, `s` is currently `n + 3`.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `b`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to run an additional iteration.
   - The loop runs based on the input value, which is read using `int(input())`.

Given that the loop has already completed `n` iterations, the next iteration would be the `(n+1)`-th iteration. However, since the loop condition is defined by the input value, and we are not given a specific input value, we need to consider the general case where the loop would run one more time if the input value is greater than 0.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable that changes with each iteration of the loop is `s`, which increments by 1.
   - The loop will run one more time if the input value is greater than 0, so `s` will become `n + 4`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `len(b) + 1`.
   - `a` and `b` will retain their structures as described.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`s` is equal to `n + 4`, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, and the loop has executed until `i` is equal to the length of `b` + 1.**
