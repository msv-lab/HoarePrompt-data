Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list that includes the element `lit[i]`. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i + 1` in `lit`, then `b` has appended the element `lit[i]`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`, and `b` still includes the element `lit[i]`.
