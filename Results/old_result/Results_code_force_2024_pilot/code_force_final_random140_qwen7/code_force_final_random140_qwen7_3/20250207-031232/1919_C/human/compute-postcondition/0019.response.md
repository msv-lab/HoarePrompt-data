Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with its last element now being `lit[i]`, `b` includes the element `lit[i + 1]` and may have appended the element `lit[i]` depending on the condition evaluated in the if statement.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. The last element of `a` is now `lit[i]`. The state of `b` remains unchanged unless there was an if statement that appended `lit[i]` to `b`, which is not specified in the given code snippet. Therefore, we keep the condition about `b` as it may or may not include `lit[i]` depending on the unspecified if statement.
