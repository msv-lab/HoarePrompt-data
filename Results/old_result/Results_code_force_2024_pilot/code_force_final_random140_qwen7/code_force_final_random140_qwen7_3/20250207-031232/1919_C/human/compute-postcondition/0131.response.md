Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is either `len(b) + 3` or `len(b) + 4`, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is equal to `n + 4`, `cp` is 0, `a` is one of the following: `[lit[0]]`, `[lit[0], lit[i-1]]`, or `[lit[0], lit[i-1], lit[i]]`, `b` is now `b` with `lit[i]` appended (if the if part is executed, `a[-1]` is less than `b[-1]`; otherwise, `a[-1]` is greater than or equal to `b[-1]`), and `lit` is updated to a list of integers based on user input.**
