Output State: `s` is equal to `n + 3`, `i` is `len(b)`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements in `lit`, `b` is a list that has undergone all comparisons as specified by the loop, and the loop has executed until `i` is equal to the length of `b`.

In this final state, the variable `s` has incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, starting from 2 (as given in the initial state). Since the loop runs for `n` iterations (based on the provided output states), `s` ends up being `n + 3`. The variable `i` reaches the length of `b` after all iterations. The lists `a` and `b` retain their structures as described, with `a` containing elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding elements, and `b` having been fully iterated over according to the loop's conditions.
