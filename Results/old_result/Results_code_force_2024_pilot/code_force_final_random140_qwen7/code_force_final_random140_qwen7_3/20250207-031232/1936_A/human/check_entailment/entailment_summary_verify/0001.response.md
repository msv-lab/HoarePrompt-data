### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the First Candidate (`ans1`):**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses the `func_1` function to compare `(p_0 | p_i)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`. This step seems to be aimed at finding a candidate index `i` where the bitwise OR with `p_0` is relatively small compared to `p_i | p_i`.

3. **Finding the Second Candidate (`mx` and `v`):**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and an empty list `v`.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` again and uses the `func_1` function to compare `(p_mx | p_i)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` and sets `mx` to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `v`. This step aims to find a set of indices where the bitwise OR with `p_mx` is relatively small compared to `p_i | p_i`.

4. **Selecting the Best Candidate:**
   - From the list `v`, it selects the first element as `mx`.
   - It then iterates through the rest of the elements in `v` and uses the `func_1` function to compare `(p_mx | p_i)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mx` to `i`. This step ensures that `mx` is the index with the largest bitwise OR value among the candidates.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer, which are supposed to be the indices maximizing the bitwise XOR.

### Analysis:

- **Flaw in Finding `ans1`:**
  - The logic for finding `ans1` is flawed. It only considers the bitwise OR of `p_0` with `p_i` and `p_i` with itself. This does not guarantee that `ans1` will be part of the optimal pair that maximizes the bitwise XOR.

- **Flaw in Finding `mx` and `v`:**
  - The logic for finding `mx` and `v` is also flawed. It only considers the bitwise OR of `p_mx` with `p_i` and `p_i` with itself. This does not guarantee that `mx` will be part of the optimal pair that maximizes the bitwise XOR.

- **Query Limit:**
  - The program does not ensure that the number of queries is within the limit of `3n`. The current logic might lead to more than `3n` queries, especially if the permutations are complex.

### Correct Function Summary:

- The function `func_1` correctly performs the required bitwise operations and returns the comparison result.

### Correct Approach:

A more effective approach would involve leveraging the properties of bitwise operations and the structure of the permutation. One possible method is to use a divide-and-conquer strategy to narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR. The logic for selecting `ans1` and `mx` is flawed, and the program does not ensure that the number of queries is within the allowed limit.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**
