Output: **NO**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000. `itest` is explicitly set to 1. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces. However, the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k` do not affect the execution of the `print('NO')` statement. This statement directly prints the string 'NO', regardless of the values of other variables.
