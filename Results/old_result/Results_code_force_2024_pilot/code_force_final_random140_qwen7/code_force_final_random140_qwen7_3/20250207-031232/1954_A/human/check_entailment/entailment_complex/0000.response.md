Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. This involves checking the conditions under which Bob can or cannot achieve his goal.

2. **Conditions Analysis**:
   - **Condition 1**: \( n \leq k \)
     - If \( n \leq k \), Bob can repaint all parts since he can choose at most \( k \) parts and \( k \geq n \).
   - **Condition 2**: \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \leq k \)
     - Here, \( \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \) represents the minimum number of different colors needed to cover all parts. If \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \leq k \), Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color because he can change at most \( k \) parts.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided solution correctly identifies these conditions.
   - If either \( n \leq k \) or \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \leq k \) holds, it prints "NO", indicating that Bob can achieve his goal.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", indicating that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles all edge cases within the constraints \( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \) and \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \).

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
