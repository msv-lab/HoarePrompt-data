Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m` is equal to 1 and `k` is less than `n`. In this scenario, Bob can always repaint the parts to match the initial color chosen by Alice, making it impossible for Alice to prevent Bob from having all parts the same color. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 1 2
```

According to the problem description, Alice should be able to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results.
