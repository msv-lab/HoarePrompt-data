Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `itest` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the integers split from the input, and the program does not change the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` regardless of whether the condition `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is met.
