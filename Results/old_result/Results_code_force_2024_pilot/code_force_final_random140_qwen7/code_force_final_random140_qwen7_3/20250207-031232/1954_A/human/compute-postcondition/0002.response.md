Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `itest` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input.**

The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `itest` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, while `t` and `itest` retain their initial conditions.
