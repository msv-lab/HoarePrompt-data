### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `n <= k`
     2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`

3. **Output Based on Conditions:**
   - If either of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon to the same color, regardless of Alice's painting. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

2. **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
   - This condition checks if Bob can repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform after Alice's painting. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to paint the ribbon with `m` colors. If the difference between `n` and this value is less than or equal to `k`, then Bob can still repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If neither condition is met, it means that no matter how Bob repainted, he couldn't make all parts the same color, thus 'Yes' should be printed. However, the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' in these cases. Let's consider the following scenarios:
     - **Case 1: `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) > k`**
       - In this case, both conditions are false, meaning that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The program should print 'Yes'.
     - **Case 2: `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
       - In this case, the second condition is true, but the first condition is false. The program incorrectly prints 'NO' instead of 'Yes'.

### Testing the Conditions:

- **Case 1: `n <= k`**
  - If `n <= k`, the program correctly prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can always repaint all parts.

- **Case 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
  - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, the program also correctly prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can still repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform.

- **Case 3: Neither Condition is True**
  - If neither condition is true, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where neither condition is true, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
