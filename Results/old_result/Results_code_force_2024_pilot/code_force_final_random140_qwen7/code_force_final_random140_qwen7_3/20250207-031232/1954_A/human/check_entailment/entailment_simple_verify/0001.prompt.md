You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, m, and k such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), itest is equal to \(t-1\), n, m, and k are the last set of integers inputted during the loop's final iteration. The value of `n` is the `n` from the last input, `m` is the `m` from the last input, and `k` is the `k` from the last input. Depending on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, either "YES" or "NO" will have been printed for each iteration, but the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` themselves will retain their last input values.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `n <= k`
     2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`

3. **Output Based on Conditions:**
   - If either of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Reasoning:

1. **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
   - This condition checks if Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon. If `n <= k`, then Bob can definitely repaint all parts to the same color, making it impossible for Alice to prevent this. Therefore, the condition should result in 'NO' when true.

2. **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
   - This condition checks if Bob can repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform after Alice's painting. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to paint the ribbon with `m` colors. If the difference between `n` and this value is less than or equal to `k`, then Bob can still repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform. Therefore, the condition should also result in 'NO' when true.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If neither condition is met, it means that no matter how Bob repainted, he couldn't make all parts the same color, thus 'Yes' should be printed.

### Testing the Conditions:

- **Case 1: `n <= k`**
  - If `n <= k`, the program correctly prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can always repaint all parts.

- **Case 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
  - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, the program also correctly prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can still repaint enough parts to make the ribbon uniform.

- **Case 3: Neither Condition is True**
  - If neither condition is true, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is correct.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
