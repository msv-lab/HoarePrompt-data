Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `itest` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not change the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. Otherwise, the program does not change the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
