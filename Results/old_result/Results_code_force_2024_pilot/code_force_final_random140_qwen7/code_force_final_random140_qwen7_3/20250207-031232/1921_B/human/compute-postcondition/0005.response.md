State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n` must be true at the start.
3. Since `i` starts at 0, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
4. The variables `a` and `b` are not used in the loop condition or initialization, so they do not need to be adjusted.
