Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is `s[i] > t[i]`
   - `b` is 1
   - `i` is `n-2`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` was `n-2` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to `n-1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is derived from `s[i] > t[i]` and `i` is now `n-1`.
   - `b` remains 1.
   - `i` is updated to `n-1`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is `s[n-1] > t[n-1]`, `b` is 1, `i` is `n-1`**
