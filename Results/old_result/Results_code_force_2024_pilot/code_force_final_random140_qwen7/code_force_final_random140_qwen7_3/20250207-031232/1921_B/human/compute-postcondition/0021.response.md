Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is a newly input string**.

Explanation: The code initializes `a` and `b` to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `a` is now 0, `b` is now 0, `i` is still `n-1`, and `t` remains a newly input string.
