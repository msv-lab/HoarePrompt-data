Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing the initial and desired states of the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    a = b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a += s[i] > t[i]
        b += s[i] < t[i]
    print(max(a, b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is equal to the count of indices `i` where `s[i] > t[i]` holds true over the entire range of `n`, and `b` is equal to the count of indices `i` where `s[i] < t[i]` holds true over the entire range of `n`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` after the loop has executed all its iterations.

In simpler terms, `a` will hold the total number of times an element in list `s` is greater than the corresponding element in list `t`, and `b` will hold the total number of times an element in list `s` is less than the corresponding element in list `t`. After the loop completes, `i` will be set to the last index `n-1` of the lists `s` and `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is the sum of all `s[i] > t[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `b` is `4 + (n - 3)`, `i` is `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, variable `a` will hold the total count of positions where the character in string `s` is greater than the corresponding character in string `t`. Variable `b` starts at 0 and increments by 2 each time through the loop (since it was 1 after the first iteration and 2 after the second, and so on), so after `n` iterations, `b` will be `4 + (n - 3)`, which simplifies to `n + 1`. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n` (after `n` iterations).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` will contain the total count of positions where the character in string `s` is greater than the corresponding character in string `t`; `b` will contain the total count of positions where the character in string `s` is less than the corresponding character in string `t`; `i` will be `n - 1` after the loop finishes; `t` will remain unchanged as it was an input and not modified by the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `a` will hold the sum of instances where characters in `s` are greater than those in `t`, and `b` will hold the sum of instances where characters in `s` are less than those in `t`. The variable `i` starts from `n-1` and gets decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, but its final value within the loop context is `n-1`. The string `t` remains unaffected as it is used for comparison but not altered during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
