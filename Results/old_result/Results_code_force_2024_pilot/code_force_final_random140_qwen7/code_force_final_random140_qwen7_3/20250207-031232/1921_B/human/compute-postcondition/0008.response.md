Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is 0
   - `b` is 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` is True, else `b` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (since `i` starts from 0 and the loop runs for `n` iterations)

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Consider the state of other variables (`a` and `b`)**:
   - These variables are not part of the loop head, so their values do not change for the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains 0
   - `b` remains 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` is True, else `b` remains 0
   - `i` is now 1
   - `n` must still be greater than 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` is True, else `b` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
