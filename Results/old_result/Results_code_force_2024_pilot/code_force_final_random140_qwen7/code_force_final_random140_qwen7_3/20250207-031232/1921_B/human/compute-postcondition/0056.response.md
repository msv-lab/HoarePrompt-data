Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is increased by 1
   - If `s1[i]` equals `s2[i]`, `hd` remains unchanged

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n` and check if `n` is still greater than 0.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `n`
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (since it was greater than 0 at the start of the loop)

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
