Output State: **`a` is `s[i] > t[i]` and `b` is 1, `i` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `a += s[i] > t[i]` updates the value of `a` by adding the boolean result of `s[i] > t[i]` to the current value of `a`. However, since the initial value of `a` is `s[n-1] > t[n-1]`, and the code does not change the value of `b` or `i`, these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` is updated to include the result of `s[i] > t[i]`, while `b` and `i` retain their initial values.
