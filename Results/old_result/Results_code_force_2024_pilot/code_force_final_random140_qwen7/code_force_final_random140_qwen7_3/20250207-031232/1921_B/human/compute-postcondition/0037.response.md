Output State: **`a` is the sum of all `s[i] > t[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `b` is `n + 3`, `i` is `n - 1`, `t` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `t = input()` reads an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `s` as an input string is not modified, so it is still considered as an input string.
