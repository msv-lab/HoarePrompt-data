Output State: **`a` is the original value of `a` plus 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, otherwise it remains the same; `b` is `b` plus 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b += s[i] < t[i]` checks if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`. If true, `b` is incremented by 1. The value of `a` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is "the original value of `a` plus 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, otherwise it remains the same."
