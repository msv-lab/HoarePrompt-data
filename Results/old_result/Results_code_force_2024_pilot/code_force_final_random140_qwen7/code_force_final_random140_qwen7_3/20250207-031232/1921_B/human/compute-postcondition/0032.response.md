Output State: `a` is the sum of all `s[i] > t[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `b` is `4 + (n - 3)`, `i` is `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, variable `a` will hold the total count of positions where the character in string `s` is greater than the corresponding character in string `t`. Variable `b` starts at 0 and increments by 2 each time through the loop (since it was 1 after the first iteration and 2 after the second, and so on), so after `n` iterations, `b` will be `4 + (n - 3)`, which simplifies to `n + 1`. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n` (after `n` iterations).
