Output State: **`a` is the sum of all `s[i] > t[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `b` is `n + 3`, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input string and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `n` remains an input integer.
