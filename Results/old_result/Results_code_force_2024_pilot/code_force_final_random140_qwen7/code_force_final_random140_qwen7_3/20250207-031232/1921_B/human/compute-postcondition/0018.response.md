Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is equal to the count of indices `i` where `s[i] > t[i]` holds true over the entire range of `n`, `b` is equal to the count of indices `i` where `s[i] < t[i]` holds true over the entire range of `n`, and `i` is equal to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged because no operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet.
