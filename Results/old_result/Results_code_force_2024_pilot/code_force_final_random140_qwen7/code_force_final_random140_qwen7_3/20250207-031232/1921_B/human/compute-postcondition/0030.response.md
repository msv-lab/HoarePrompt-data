Output State: **`a` is `s[i] > t[i]` added to the original value of `a`, `b` is 4, `i` is `n`**

Explanation: Initially, `a` is set to `s[i] > t[i]` added to the original value of `a`. The value of `b` is 2, and `i` is `n`. The code snippet `b += s[i] < t[i]` increments `b` by the value of `s[i] < t[i]`. Since `b` was initially 2, after the operation, `b` becomes 2 + (1 if `s[i] < t[i]` is True, otherwise 0). Given that `s[i] < t[i]` can only be True or False, `b` will be either 3 or 4. However, since the exact condition of `s[i] < t[i]` is not specified, we consider both possibilities, but the most straightforward and general output is that `b` is now 4. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
