You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing the initial and desired states of the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` will contain the total count of positions where the character in string `s` is greater than the corresponding character in string `t`; `b` will contain the total count of positions where the character in string `s` is less than the corresponding character in string `t`; `i` will be `n - 1` after the loop finishes; `t` will remain unchanged as it was an input and not modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and another string `t` of the same length. For each test case, it counts the number of positions where the characters in `s` are greater than and less than the corresponding characters in `t`. It then prints the maximum of these two counts, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into a state where each character matches the corresponding character in `t`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the desired state `t`. The operations include:
- Adding a cat to an empty box (`b_i = 0`).
- Removing a cat from a non-empty box (`b_i = 1`).
- Moving a cat from one box to another.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of boxes `n`.
2. Reads the initial state `s` as a string.
3. Reads the desired state `t` as a string.
4. Initializes two counters `a` and `b` to zero.
5. Iterates through each box:
   - If the initial state `s[i]` is greater than the desired state `t[i]`, it increments `a`.
   - If the initial state `s[i]` is less than the desired state `t[i]`, it increments `b`.
6. Prints the maximum of `a` and `b`.

### Reasoning
1. **Counting Mismatches**: The program counts the number of positions where the initial state `s` has more cats than the desired state `t` (variable `a`) and where the initial state `s` has fewer cats than the desired state `t` (variable `b`).

2. **Misplaced Cats**: 
   - For each position where `s[i] > t[i]`, we need to remove a cat (operation `b`).
   - For each position where `s[i] < t[i]`, we need to add a cat (operation `a`).

3. **Minimum Operations**: The total number of operations required is the maximum of these two counts because:
   - We can either remove excess cats or add missing cats, but we cannot do both simultaneously for the same position without increasing the count.

### Correctness Check
The logic of the program is correct. It correctly counts the number of cats that need to be added or removed to match the desired state. The maximum of these two counts gives the minimum number of operations required.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

**Correctness: True**
