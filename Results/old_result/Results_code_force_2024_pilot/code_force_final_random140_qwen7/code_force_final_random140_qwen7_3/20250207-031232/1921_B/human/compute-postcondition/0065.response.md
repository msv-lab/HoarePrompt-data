Output State: **`res` is the absolute difference between the counts of '1' in `s1` and `s2`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `hd` is the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` and assigns it to `res`. The variables `i`, `n`, and `hd` remain unchanged from their previous states.
