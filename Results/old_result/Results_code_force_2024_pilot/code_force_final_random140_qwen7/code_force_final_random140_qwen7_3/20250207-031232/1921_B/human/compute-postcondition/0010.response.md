Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 1 if s[0] < t[0] is True and s[2] < t[2] is True, else `b` is 0, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The initial state is `a` is 1, `b` is 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` is True, else `b` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0. The code `b += s[i] < t[i]` increments `b` by the boolean value of `s[i] < t[i]`. Since `i` is 2, the condition checks `s[2] < t[2]`. The value of `b` will be 1 if both `s[0] < t[0]` and `s[2] < t[2]` are True, otherwise, it remains 0. The values of `a`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
