Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is `s[i] > t[i]`
   - `b` is 2
   - `i` is `n-1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and should still be within the range `[0, n-1)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `i` would make it `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Hence, `i` should be set to `n-1 + 1 = n`.

5. **Update other variables**:
   - The variable `a` is derived from `s[i] > t[i]`. With `i` being `n`, `a` will be `s[n] > t[n]`.
   - The variable `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is `s[n] > t[n]`, `b` is 2, `i` is `n`**
