Output State: **`a` is `s[i] > t[i]`, `b` is 2, `i` is `n-1`**

Explanation: Initially, `a` is set to the boolean value of `s[i] > t[i]`, `b` is 1, and `i` is `n-1`. The code snippet updates `b` by adding the boolean value of `s[i] < t[i]` to `b`. Since `b` was initially 1, it will now be `1 + (s[i] < t[i])`. Given that `s[i] < t[i]` results in a boolean value (either `True` or `False`), and `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` in arithmetic operations, `b` will be updated to `2` if `s[i] < t[i]` is `True`, otherwise it remains `1`. However, since `i` is not reassigned, its value remains `n-1`. Therefore, the final state includes the updated value of `b` and the unchanged values of `a` and `i`.
