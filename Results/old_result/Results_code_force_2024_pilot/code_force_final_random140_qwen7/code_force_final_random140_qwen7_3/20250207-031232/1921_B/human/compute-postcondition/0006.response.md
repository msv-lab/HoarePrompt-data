Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, `s[i] > t[i]` is evaluated but not assigned to any variable.**

Explanation: The code updates `a` by adding 1 if `s[i] > t[i]` is true. However, since `s` and `t` are not defined in the initial state, and no specific values for `s[i]` and `t[i]` are given, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. The condition `s[i] > t[i]` is evaluated but its result is not stored in any variable. All other variables (`b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
