Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` is True and `s[2] < t[2]` is True, else `b` is 0; `i` is 3; `b` is `s[3] < t[3]`.**

Explanation: Initially, `b` is set to 1 if both `s[0] < t[0]` and `s[2] < t[2]` are True, otherwise `b` is 0. The code then increments `b` by the result of `s[i] < t[i]`, where `i` is 3. This means `b` is now `b + (s[3] < t[3])`. Since the initial value of `b` is either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, and it is now incremented by `(s[3] < t[3])`, the new value of `b` is `b + (s[3] < t[3])`.
