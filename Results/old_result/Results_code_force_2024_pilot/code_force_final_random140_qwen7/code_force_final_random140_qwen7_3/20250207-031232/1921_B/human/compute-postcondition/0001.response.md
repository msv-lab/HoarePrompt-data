Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input is taken for `n` and no operation affects `t`. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition of being a positive integer within the specified range, while `n` is now an integer input by the user.
