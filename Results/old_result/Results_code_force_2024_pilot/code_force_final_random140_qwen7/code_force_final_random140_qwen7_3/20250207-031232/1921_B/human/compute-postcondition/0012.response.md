Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` is True and `s[2] < t[2]` is True, else `b` is 0, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `a += s[i] > t[i]` increments `a` by 1 if the condition `s[i] > t[i]` is true. Given the initial state, `i` is 3. However, the values of `s[3]` and `t[3]` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. But since `a` was initially 1, `a` will remain 1 unless `s[3] > t[3]` is true, which would increment `a` to 2. Since no such condition is met, `a` remains 1. The other variables (`b`, `i`, and the conditions related to `b`) remain unchanged.
