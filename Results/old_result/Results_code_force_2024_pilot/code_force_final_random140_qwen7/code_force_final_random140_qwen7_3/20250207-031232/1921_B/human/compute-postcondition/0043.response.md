Output State: **`a` is the original value of `a` plus 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, otherwise it remains the same; `b` is `b` plus 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `a += s[i] > t[i]` increments `a` by 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. It also increments `b` by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid after the code execution.
