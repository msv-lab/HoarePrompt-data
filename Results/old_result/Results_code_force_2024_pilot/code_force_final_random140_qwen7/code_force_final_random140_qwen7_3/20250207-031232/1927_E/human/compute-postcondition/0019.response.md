Output State: **`idx` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros where one element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is set to `bottom_v`; `bottom_v` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1; `top_v` is `n`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`**.

Explanation: The code sets the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to the value of `bottom_v`. Since `bottom_v` is either 2 or 0 depending on the value of `idx`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `n`, the `permutation` list now has one element updated. All other variables remain unchanged.
