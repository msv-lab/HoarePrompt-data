Postcondition: `idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + 2k + 1`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + 1` if `idx` is odd, and `bottom_v` is increased by 1.
