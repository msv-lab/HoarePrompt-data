Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + `k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` from `top_v - 1` to `top_v`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `idx` is either 2 or 3, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is either `2 + k` or `3 + k`, and it is still required to be less than `len(permutation)`. The value of `k` remains greater than 3, and the condition regarding `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now that it equals `top_v`.
