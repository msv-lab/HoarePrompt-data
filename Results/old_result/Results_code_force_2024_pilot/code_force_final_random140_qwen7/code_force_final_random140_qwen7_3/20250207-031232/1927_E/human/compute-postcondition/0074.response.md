Postcondition: `idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` must be greater than 3; if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - n + 1`, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is not `bottom_v + n - 1`
