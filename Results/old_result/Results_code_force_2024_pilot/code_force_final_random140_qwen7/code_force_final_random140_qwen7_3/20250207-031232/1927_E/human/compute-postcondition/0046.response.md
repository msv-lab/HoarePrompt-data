Postcondition: `idx` is either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is either 1 or 2, and `len(permutation)` is greater than 1. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `bottom_v + 1`, and `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `top_v - 1`.
