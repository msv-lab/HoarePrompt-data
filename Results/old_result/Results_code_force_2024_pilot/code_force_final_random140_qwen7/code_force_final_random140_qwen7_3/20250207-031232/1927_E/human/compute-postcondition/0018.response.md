Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the input.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `bottom_v` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1.
   - `top_v` is `n`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Since `len(permutation)` is `n`, the loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < n`.
   - Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` starts at `k` (which is even and between 2 and `n`), the loop will execute as long as `k < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. It must be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros; `bottom_v` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1; `top_v` is `n`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`**.
