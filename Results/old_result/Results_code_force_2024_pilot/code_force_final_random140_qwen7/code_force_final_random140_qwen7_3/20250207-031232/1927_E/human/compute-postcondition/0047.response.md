Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + k`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is incremented by `k`. Since `idx` is either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will become `idx + k`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
