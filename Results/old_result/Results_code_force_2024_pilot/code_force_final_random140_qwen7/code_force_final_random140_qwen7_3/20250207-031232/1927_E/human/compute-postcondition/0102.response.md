Output State: **`idx` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the input with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where each element alternates between `4` and `n-3` based on the value of `idx` modulo 2, `bottom_v` is `4`, and `top_v` is `n-3`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` equals `n`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `idx` is either 3 or 4.
- The loop runs until `idx` reaches `k`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated by adding `k` until it reaches or exceeds `n`.
- After all iterations, `idx` will be `k` (since `k` is even and within the range \(2 \leq k \leq n\)).
- `bottom_v` starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each valid index it fills, so after 3 iterations, it becomes 4.
- `top_v` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 for each valid index it fills, so after 3 iterations, it becomes `n-3`.
- Each valid index filled alternates between `bottom_v` (which is 4) and `top_v` (which is `n-3`) based on whether `idx` is even or odd.

Therefore, the `permutation` list will contain alternating values of 4 and `n-3`.
