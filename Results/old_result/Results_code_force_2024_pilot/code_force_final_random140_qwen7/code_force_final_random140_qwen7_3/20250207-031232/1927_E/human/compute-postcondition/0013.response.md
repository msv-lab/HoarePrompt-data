Functionality: **The function processes up to `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` (with 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k being even). It then calls another function `func_1()` for each test case without returning any specific value. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the variable `t` is less than or equal to 0.**
