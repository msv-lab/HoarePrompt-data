Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + 3*k + 1; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; `bottom_v` is increased by 1; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 4.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by the value of `k`. Given that `k` is greater than 3, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to its original value plus `k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
