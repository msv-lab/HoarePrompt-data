Functionality: **The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from input, where \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even. It constructs a list `permutation` of length \(n\) where each element is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` based on the parity of the current index. Specifically, elements at indices that are multiples of \(k\) plus the current index are filled with `bottom_v` starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each valid index, and elements at other indices are filled with `top_v` starting from \(n\) and decreasing by 1 for each valid index. After constructing the list, it prints the elements of the list as a space-separated string. If the conditions on \(n\) and \(k\) are not met, the function will raise an error.**
