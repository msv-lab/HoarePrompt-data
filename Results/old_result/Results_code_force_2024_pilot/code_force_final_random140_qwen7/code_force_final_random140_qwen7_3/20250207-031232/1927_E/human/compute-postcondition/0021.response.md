Output State: **`idx` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with one element updated to `top_v` at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `bottom_v` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1; `top_v` is `n`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `permutation` list by setting the element at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to `top_v`. Since `top_v` is equal to `n`, the `permutation` list is modified accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.
