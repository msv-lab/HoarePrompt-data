Output State: `idx` is either 3 or 4, `n` is an integer obtained from the input with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` based on the value of `idx` modulo 2, `bottom_v` is increased by 3 from its initial value, and `top_v` is decreased by 3 from its initial value, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` equals `n`.

To understand this final state:
- The loop runs until `idx` reaches `k`. Since `k` is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n\), `idx` will eventually reach `k`.
- During each iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated by adding `k` until it reaches or exceeds `n`.
- After all iterations, `idx` will be `k` (if `k` is less than or equal to 4, then `idx` will be `k` or `k+1`).
- `bottom_v` starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each valid index it fills, so after 3 iterations, it increases by 3.
- `top_v` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 for each valid index it fills, so after 3 iterations, it decreases by 3.
- Each valid index filled alternates between `bottom_v` and `top_v` based on whether `idx` is even or odd.
