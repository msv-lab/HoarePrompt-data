Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation of length n.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The function `func_1()` constructs the permutation.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two variables `bottom_v` and `top_v` initialized to 1 and `n`, respectively.
   - It iterates over indices from 0 to `k-1` (inclusive).
     - For each index `idx`, it updates elements at positions `idx`, `idx+k`, `idx+2k`, etc., in the permutation list.
     - If `idx` is even, it assigns the current value of `bottom_v` to the position and increments `bottom_v`.
     - If `idx` is odd, it assigns the current value of `top_v` to the position and decrements `top_v`.

3. **Output:**
   - The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

### Verification of k-Level Property

To verify if the constructed permutation is k-level, we need to check if the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` is at most 1.

#### Example Test Case:
- Let's consider the test case `n = 10` and `k = 4`.

#### Permutation Construction:
- The initial permutation is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- After processing:
  - For `idx = 0` (even): `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - For `idx = 1` (odd): `[1, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - For `idx = 2` (even): `[1, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - For `idx = 3` (odd): `[1, 10, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

#### Sum Calculation:
- Sums of segments of length 4:
  - Segment starting at index 0: `1 + 10 + 3 + 9 = 23`
  - Segment starting at index 1: `10 + 3 + 9 + 0 = 22`
  - Segment starting at index 2: `3 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 12`
  - Segment starting at index 3: `9 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9`

#### Maximum and Minimum Sums:
- Maximum sum: `23`
- Minimum sum: `9`
- Difference: `23 - 9 = 14`

This shows that the constructed permutation does not satisfy the k-level property for this example.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation because the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` can be greater than 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
