Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + 2*k + 1; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; `bottom_v` is increased by 1; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 4.**

Explanation: The variable `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their original conditions and values. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains as `idx + 2*k + 1`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is still 4.
