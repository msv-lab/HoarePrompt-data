Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + nk + (n-1)`, where `n` is the total number of iterations; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v + n - 1`, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - n + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. Given that `idx` was initially either 1 or 2, after executing `idx += 1`, `idx` will now be either 2 or 3. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
