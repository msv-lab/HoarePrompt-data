Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`.

2. **Understand the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`. 

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `idx` is either 1 or 2.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is either 1 or 2.

4. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Since `idx` can be either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` being 1 or 2 is a valid starting point, but we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`.

5. **Adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` can be either 1 or 2, we need to make sure that `len(permutation)` is greater than 1 (since 2 is the maximum value for `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`).

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is either 1 or 2, and `len(permutation)` must be greater than 1**
