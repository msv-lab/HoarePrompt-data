Output State: **`idx` is either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with one element updated to `n-1` at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `bottom_v` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1; `top_v` is `n-1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `top_v -= 1` decrements the value of `top_v` by 1. Since `top_v` was initially set to `n`, after executing this line, `top_v` becomes `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
