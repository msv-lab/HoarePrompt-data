Postcondition: `idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`.
