The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be greater than 0. According to the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since `t` is equal to `t - 1`, it means `t` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1**
