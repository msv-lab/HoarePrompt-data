Output State: The loop will continue until `idx` equals `k`. Given that `k` is even and within the range \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), the loop will execute exactly `k` times. After all iterations, `idx` will be equal to `k`.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

- `idx` will be set to `k` after the loop completes.
- `bottom_v` will be incremented by `k/2` because it increases by 1 each time `idx` is even, and there are `k/2` even numbers between 0 and `k-1` if `k` is even.
- `top_v` will decrease by `k/2` for similar reasons as `bottom_v`.

Since `permutation` is initially a list of `n` zeros, and during each iteration, positions that are multiples of `k + idx` are filled with values from `bottom_v` or `top_v` based on the parity of `idx`, the final state of `permutation` will be filled according to these rules up to the point where `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` exceeds `n`.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be:
- `idx` is `k`.
- `bottom_v` is `n + 1 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx // k) * 2`, which simplifies to `n + 1 - (n // k) * 2` since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be `n` or slightly less.
- `top_v` is `n - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx // k) * 2`, which also simplifies to `n - (n // k) * 2`.
- `permutation` will contain values from `bottom_v` and `top_v` filling the positions that are multiples of `k + idx` as described in the loop body.

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:
Output State: `idx` is `k`, `bottom_v` is `n + 1 - (n // k) * 2`, `top_v` is `n - (n // k) * 2`, and `permutation` is a list of `n` integers filled according to the specified rules.
