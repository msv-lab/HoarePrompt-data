Output State: `idx` remains either 0 or 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where each index `i` (where `i` is a multiple of `k` plus `idx`) contains either `bottom_v - 1` or `top_v + 1` depending on the value of `idx` (0 or 1) and the parity of the iteration; `bottom_v` is `n + 1` because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each valid placement in the permutation; `top_v` is `-1` because it starts at `n` and decrements by 1 for each valid placement in the permutation; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `n` since the loop continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is no longer less than the length of `permutation`.

This means that after all iterations, the `permutation` list will have elements placed according to the rules defined in the loop, with `bottom_v` and `top_v` adjusted as described, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` reaching the length of the `permutation` list.
