Output State: **`idx` is 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`; `bottom_v` is 3; `len(permutation)` is greater than 2; `k` is greater than 3; and `idx` is even.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
