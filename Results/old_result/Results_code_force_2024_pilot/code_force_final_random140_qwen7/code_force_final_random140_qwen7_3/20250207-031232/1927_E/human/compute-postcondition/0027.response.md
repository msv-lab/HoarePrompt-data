Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v`, `idx` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and it is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with one element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx + k` updated, `bottom_v` is either 3 or 1 depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1, `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1` depending on the condition of the if statement, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than the length of `permutation` before the next iteration.**

Explanation: The line `bottom_v += 1` increments the value of `bottom_v` by 1. Since `bottom_v` was initially either 2 or 0 (depending on whether `idx` is 0 or 1), after adding 1, `bottom_v` will now be either 3 or 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
