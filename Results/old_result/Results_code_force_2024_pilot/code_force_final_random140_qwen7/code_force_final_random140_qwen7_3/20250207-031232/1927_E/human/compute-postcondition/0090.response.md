Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx` + 2*k + 1; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` is greater than 3; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 4.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` to `bottom_v`, which is 4. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
