Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + 2k + 1`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v`; otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v`**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` from `top_v - 1` or `bottom_v + 1` (depending on whether `idx` is even or odd) to `top_v`. Since `idx` is either 1 or 2, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is defined as `idx + 2k + 1`, the length of `permutation` remains greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The condition for `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` being `top_v - 1` or `bottom_v + 1` no longer applies, and it is now explicitly set to `top_v`.
