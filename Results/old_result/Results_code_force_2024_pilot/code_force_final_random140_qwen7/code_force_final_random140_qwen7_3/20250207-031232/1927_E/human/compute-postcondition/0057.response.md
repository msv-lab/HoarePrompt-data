Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + 2k + 1`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`; otherwise, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` from `bottom_v + 1` to `bottom_v` when `idx` is even, and from `top_v - 1` to `bottom_v` when `idx` is odd. Since the initial state specifies the conditions under which `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` was set to `bottom_v + 1` or `top_v - 1`, these conditions now no longer apply. Therefore, the updated condition for `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is simply `bottom_v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
