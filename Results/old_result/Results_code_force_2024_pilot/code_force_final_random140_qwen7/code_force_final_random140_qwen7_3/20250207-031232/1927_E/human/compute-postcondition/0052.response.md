Output State: **`idx` is either 1 or 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx + k`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is equal to `top_v - 1`; `len(permutation)` must be greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.**

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now `top_v - 1`.
