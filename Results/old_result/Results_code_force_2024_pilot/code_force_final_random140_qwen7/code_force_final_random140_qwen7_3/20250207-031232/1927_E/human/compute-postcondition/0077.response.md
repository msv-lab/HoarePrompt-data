Output State: **`idx` is either 2 or 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`; `k` must be greater than 3; if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1. Since `idx` is either 2 or 3, and if `idx` is odd (`idx` is 3), then `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` (which is equal to `idx`) is now `top_v - 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
