Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of test cases (`t`), and for each of these, it processes a list of integers (`n` integers). The function does not return a single value but processes and returns results for each test case individually.
