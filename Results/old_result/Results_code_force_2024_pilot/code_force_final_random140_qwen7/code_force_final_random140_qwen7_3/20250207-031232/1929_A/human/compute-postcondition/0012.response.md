Output State: The value of `t` is now the input value from the last iteration of the loop, `n` is the input integer from the last iteration, and `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user for the last iteration. The loop has processed all the input cases provided, and there are no more iterations left to execute.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the input value from the last test case, `n` will be the integer size of the array for the last test case, and `ar` will be the sorted list of integers corresponding to the last input array. The loop has completed processing all given test cases.
