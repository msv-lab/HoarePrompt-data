Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 500 is still valid.
