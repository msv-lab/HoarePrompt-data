Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:
```python
print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
```

Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. **List Comprehension**: 
   - For each index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), the expression `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` calculates the difference between the current element `ar[i]` and the previous element `ar[i - 1]`.

2. **Summation**:
   - The `sum` function adds up all the differences calculated in the list comprehension.

To understand what this expression represents, consider the following:
- If `ar` is a sorted list of integers, the differences `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` represent the gaps between consecutive elements in the list.
- Summing these differences gives the total "distance" covered by moving from the first element to the last element of the list, stepping through each consecutive pair.

Thus, the expression computes the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar` up to the `n-1`th element.

Output: **sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar` up to the `n-1`th element**
