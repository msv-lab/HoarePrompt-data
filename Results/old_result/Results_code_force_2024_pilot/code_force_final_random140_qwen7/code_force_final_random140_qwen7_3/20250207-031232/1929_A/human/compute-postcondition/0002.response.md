Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, sorts them, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `ar`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `ar` is created and contains the sorted integers.
