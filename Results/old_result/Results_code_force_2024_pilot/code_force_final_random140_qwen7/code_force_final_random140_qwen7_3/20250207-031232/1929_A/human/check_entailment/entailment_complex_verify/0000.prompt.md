You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` will be the input value for the last iteration of the loop, `n` will be the input integer for the last iteration, and `ar` will be a sorted list of integers entered by the user for the last iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will hold the value of the final test case's `t`, `n` will hold the value of the final test case's `n`, and `ar` will be the sorted list of integers corresponding to the final test case's input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it sorts the list of integers, calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly rearrange the array to maximize the beauty as described in the problem statement. The program simply sorts the array and calculates the difference between consecutive elements, which does not necessarily yield the maximum possible beauty. For instance, consider the input:

```
4
10 5 3 8
```

The sorted array would be `[3, 5, 8, 10]`, and the calculated beauty would be `(5-3) + (8-5) + (10-8) = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7`. However, the optimal arrangement could be `[10, 3, 5, 8]`, which gives a beauty of `(3-10) + (5-3) + (8-5) = -7 + 2 + 3 = -2`.

To maximize the beauty, the largest element should be placed at the beginning, followed by the smallest element, then the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the positive differences are maximized and negative differences minimized. The provided solution does not account for this optimal arrangement.
