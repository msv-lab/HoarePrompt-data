Output State: **`t` is the new input value, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `n` is assigned the value of the new input integer, and `ar` is a list of integers sorted based on the input values.**

Explanation: The code takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, converts the resulting map object to a list, sorts the list, and assigns it to `ar`. The variable `n` is updated to the new input integer value, and `t` retains its original value as specified in the initial state.
