You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)]))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it sorts the list of integers, calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `ar` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))`.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Specifically, the program computes `sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)])`.

### Reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are at the beginning and the largest elements are at the end.
   - This maximizes the difference between consecutive elements because the difference between two close numbers is smaller than the difference between two distant numbers.

2. **Summing Differences:**
   - By sorting, the expression `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` will yield the maximum possible values for these differences.
   - This is because the smallest element will be paired with the next smallest element, the second smallest with the third smallest, and so on.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.
   - It correctly calculates the maximum beauty by ensuring the array is sorted before computing the differences.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized for any given array.

Correctness: **True**
