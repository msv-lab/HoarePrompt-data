### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand why the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this sum, we need to ensure that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are as large as possible. The optimal strategy is to place the largest elements at the beginning and the smallest elements at the end, ensuring that the positive differences are maximized and the negative differences are minimized.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements:
```python
ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
```

This approach does not guarantee the optimal arrangement. Sorting the array simply arranges the elements in non-decreasing order, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty. For example, consider the input:
```
4
10 5 3 8
```

- Sorted array: `[3, 5, 8, 10]`
- Calculated beauty: \((5-3) + (8-5) + (10-8) = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7\)

However, the optimal arrangement is `[10, 3, 5, 8]`, which gives:
- Calculated beauty: \((3-10) + (5-3) + (8-5) = -7 + 2 + 3 = -2\)

This shows that sorting the array does not always yield the maximum beauty.

#### Correct Approach:
To achieve the maximum beauty, we should alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. Specifically, we can arrange the array as follows:
- Place the largest element first.
- Place the smallest remaining element next.
- Continue alternating until all elements are placed.

This ensures that the positive differences are maximized and the negative differences are minimized.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate because the provided solution does not account for the optimal arrangement of elements to maximize the beauty. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
