Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of different final configurations of the chessboard. The functions `func_1` and `helper` do not relate to the problem description at all. The problem requires calculating the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the mirroring effect of the computer's moves. However, the given functions seem to be implementing a dynamic programming solution for a different problem, possibly related to counting something else entirely.

To solve this problem, you would need to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining squares of the board after the initial \(k\) moves, taking into account the constraints and the mirroring effect. The current implementation does not address these requirements and thus is incorrect.
