Output State: **`len` is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0, and len is now in dp; `y` is `x1 + x2`.**

Explanation: The line `dp[len] = y` assigns the value of `y` (which is `x1 + x2`) to the dictionary `dp` at the key `len`. This means that `len` is now stored in the dictionary `dp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
