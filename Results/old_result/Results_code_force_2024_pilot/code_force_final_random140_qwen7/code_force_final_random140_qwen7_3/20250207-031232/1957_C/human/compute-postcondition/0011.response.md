Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `len`, which is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made. It returns 1 in Case_1, the value stored in dp at the index equal to the current value of `len` in Case_2, and the sum of x1 and x2 in Case_3.**
