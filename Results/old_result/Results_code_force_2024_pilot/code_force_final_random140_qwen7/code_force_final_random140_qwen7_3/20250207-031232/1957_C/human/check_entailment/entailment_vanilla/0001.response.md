Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after `k` moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Given Code**:
   - The code includes two functions: `func_1` and `helper`.
   - `func_1` calls `helper` with an argument `x`, but the value of `x` is not defined in the context of the problem.
   - `helper` is a recursive function that calculates a value based on the length of the remaining positions (`len`).

3. **Recursive Function `helper`**:
   - Base Case: If `len <= 0`, it returns 1.
   - Memoization: Uses a dictionary `dp` to store previously computed values for efficiency.
   - Recursive Calculation: 
     - `x1 = helper(len - 1)` (one less position).
     - `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` (two less positions, considering the two ways to place rooks).
     - Returns the sum of `x1` and `x2`.

4. **Integration with Problem**:
   - The function `helper` seems to be calculating something related to the number of configurations, but it does not directly relate to the problem of counting configurations on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after `k` moves.
   - The input `x` to `func_1` is not defined in the context of the problem, making it unclear how this function fits into the solution.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The recursive function `helper` does not account for the constraints of the problem (e.g., no two rooks attacking each other, mirroring of moves, etc.).
   - The function `func_1` is not defined in terms of the problem parameters (n, k, and the moves).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
