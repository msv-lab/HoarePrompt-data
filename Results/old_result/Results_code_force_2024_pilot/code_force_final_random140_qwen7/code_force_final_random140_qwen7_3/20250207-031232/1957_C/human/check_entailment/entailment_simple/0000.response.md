Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of moves. The moves are such that after each of your moves, the computer mirrors your move by placing a rook in the corresponding mirrored position. This means that after \( k \) moves, the board will have \( k \) pairs of rooks (one white and one black) placed such that no two rooks attack each other.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - After \( k \) moves, \( k \) rows and \( k \) columns are occupied.
   - The remaining unoccupied rows and columns form a smaller \( (n - k) \times (n - k) \) sub-board.
   - The number of ways to place rooks on this sub-board is the key to solving the problem.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` is called with the remaining size of the board \( n - k \).
   - `helper` is a recursive function that calculates the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `len`.
   - The base case of `helper` is when `len` is 0, returning 1 (no more rows/columns to place rooks).
   - For `len > 0`, the function uses memoization (`dp`) to store previously computed results for efficiency.
   - The recurrence relation in `helper` accounts for placing a rook in one of the `len` positions and then either placing another rook in one of the remaining `len-1` positions or not placing another rook, leading to the formula \( x1 + x2 \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `helper` correctly models the placement of rooks on the remaining board.
   - The use of memoization ensures that the solution is efficient and avoids redundant calculations.
   - The overall structure of the program matches the problem requirements and the logic of the solution.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
