### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We have an \(n \times n\) chessboard.
- You and the computer take turns placing rooks.
- No two rooks can attack each other (i.e., they cannot be in the same row or column).
- You start first and have already made \(k\) moves.
- The computer mirrors your moves unless \(r = c\), in which case the computer skips its turn.
- We need to calculate the number of different final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Given Code Analysis:
- The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `helper`.
- `func_1` calls `helper` but does not use its return value.
- `helper` is a recursive function that computes some value based on the input `len`.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The `helper` function is supposed to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board after \(k\) moves have been made.
- The function uses memoization to store previously computed results in `dp`.

#### Correctness of the Code:
- The `helper` function seems to be trying to count the number of ways to place rooks on a board, but it does not directly address the problem's constraints.
- The function's logic is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not account for the mirroring effect of the computer's moves or the fact that rooks cannot be placed in the same row or column.
- The function `func_1` does not utilize the `helper` function to solve the problem, making the entire implementation incorrect.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly address the problem's constraints and requirements.
