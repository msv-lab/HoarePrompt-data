#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the size of the remaining empty chessboard (i.e., n - k - k, where k is the number of moves already played by both you and the computer).
def func_1(x):
    dp = {}
    return helper(x)
    #The program returns the result of the helper function with input x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` representing the size of the remaining empty chessboard and returns the result of the `helper` function with `x` as its input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made.
def helper(len):
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value stored in dp at the index equal to the current value of len, where len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made.
    #State: len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0, and len is not in dp
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns y, which is the sum of x1 and x2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `helper` accepts a parameter `len`, which is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made. It returns 1 if `len` is less than or equal to 0. If `len` is already computed and stored in `dp`, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the result using the values of `len-1` and `len-2`, stores the result in `dp`, and returns it.
