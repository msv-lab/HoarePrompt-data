You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the size of the remaining empty chessboard (i.e., n - k - k, where k is the number of moves already played by both you and the computer).
def func_1(x):
    dp = {}
    return helper(x)
    #The program returns the result of the helper function with input x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` representing the size of the remaining empty chessboard and returns the result of the `helper` function with `x` as its input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made.
def helper(len):
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value stored in dp at the index equal to the current value of len, where len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made.
    #State: len is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0, and len is not in dp
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns y, which is the sum of x1 and x2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `helper` accepts a parameter `len`, which is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after k moves have been made. It returns 1 if `len` is less than or equal to 0. If `len` is already computed and stored in `dp`, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the result using the values of `len-1` and `len-2`, stores the result in `dp`, and returns it.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of different final configurations of the chessboard. The functions `func_1` and `helper` do not relate to the problem description at all. The problem requires calculating the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the mirroring effect of the computer's moves. However, the given functions seem to be implementing a dynamic programming solution for a different problem, possibly related to counting something else entirely.

To solve this problem, you would need to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining squares of the board after the initial \(k\) moves, taking into account the constraints and the mirroring effect. The current implementation does not address these requirements and thus is incorrect.
