Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move involves placing a rook and the opponent mirroring the move unless the coordinates are the same.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is responsible for computing the number of configurations after the initial \(k\) moves. It calls another function `helper` with the reduced size of the board (`n - k` if all moves were mirrored, otherwise `n - (k - 1)`).
   - **helper**: This recursive function computes the number of configurations for a given size of the board. It uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations, storing results in `dp`.

3. **Execution Summaries**:
   - The main loop correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reducing the board size based on the moves made and their mirroring.
   - The `func_1` function correctly reduces the board size and calls the `helper` function.
   - The `helper` function correctly handles base cases and uses recursion with memoization to compute the number of configurations.

Given the provided code and the execution summaries, the logic appears to be consistent with the problem statement and the expected behavior. The main function correctly reduces the board size and passes it to the helper function, which in turn correctly computes the number of configurations using dynamic programming.

Correctness: **True**
