Output State: **`len` is a positive integer representing the number of rows (or columns) left to place rooks on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0, and len is not in dp; `x1` is equal to `helper(len - 1)`**.

This means that the value of `len` remains unchanged, but now there is a new variable `x1` which is assigned the result of calling the function `helper(len - 1)`.
