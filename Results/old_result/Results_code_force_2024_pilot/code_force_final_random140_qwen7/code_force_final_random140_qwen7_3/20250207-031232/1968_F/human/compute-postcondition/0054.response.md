Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index found by `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or -1 if no such index exists.**

Explanation: The code `lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1` does the following:
1. It calls `func_2` with two arguments: `inds[x[r]]` and a lambda function `lambda arg: arg < l`.
2. `func_2` returns the first element in `inds[x[r]]` that satisfies the condition `arg < l` (where `arg` is each element in `inds[x[r]]`).
3. If no such element exists, `func_2` returns `None`, and the `or -1` part ensures that `lower` is set to `-1`.

Since the exact values of `inds`, `x`, and `l` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `lower`. However, we know that `lower` will be either the index found by `func_2` or `-1` if no such index exists. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
