Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`.
- `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][inds[x[l - 1]][upper]]`.
- `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`.
- `upper` is greater than `lower`.
- `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`.
- `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Yes**
