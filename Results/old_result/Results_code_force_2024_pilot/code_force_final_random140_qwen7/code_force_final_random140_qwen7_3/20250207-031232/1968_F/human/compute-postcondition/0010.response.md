Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `x` is a list with its last element being `x[-1] ^ i ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` includes the length of `x` plus one (i.e., `len(x)`), and `i` is the next element from `a` after the operation.**

Explanation: The code appends the length of the list `x` (which is `len(x) - 1` before the append operation) plus 1 to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Since `x[-1]` is `x[-1] ^ i ^ i`, which simplifies to `x[-1]` because `i ^ i` is 0, `inds[x[-1]]` is updated to include `len(x)`. Therefore, the length of `x` is now one more than it was before the append operation.
