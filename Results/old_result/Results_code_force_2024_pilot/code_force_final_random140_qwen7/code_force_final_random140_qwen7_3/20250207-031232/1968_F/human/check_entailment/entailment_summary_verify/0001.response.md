### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires checking if a subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the XOR of each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The XOR of a prefix of the array can help identify if a subarray is interesting.
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, it can always be divided into parts with the same XOR (e.g., each element is its own part).
   - If the XOR of the subarray is non-zero, we need to check if there exists a split point where the XOR values match.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function reads space-separated integers from input and applies a cast function.
   - **func_2:** This function performs binary search to find the first index where a condition is met.
   - **func_3:** This function processes the main logic:
     - Reads `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the array `a`.
     - Computes the prefix XOR values and stores indices in a dictionary.
     - For each query, checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
     - Uses binary search to find valid split points.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
     - Compute `x[i] = x[i-1] ^ a[i]` and store indices in `inds`.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - Check if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero.
     - Use binary search to find valid split points.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the prefix XOR calculation and uses binary search to find valid split points.
   - It checks the XOR of the subarray and uses the indices to validate the split points.
   - However, there are some issues with the implementation that could lead to incorrect results:
     - The function `func_2` is used to find the first index where a condition is met, but it is not clear how it is used in the context of finding valid split points.
     - The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is not fully implemented. Specifically, the use of `func_2` to find split points might not be correct.
     - The code assumes that if the XOR of the subarray is zero, it is always interesting, which is not necessarily true. For example, `[1, 1]` has a XOR of zero but cannot be divided into two parts with the same XOR.

### Conclusion:
While the code attempts to solve the problem, there are logical flaws in the implementation that could lead to incorrect results. The original assessment did not fully address these issues, leading to an incomplete and potentially incorrect solution.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
