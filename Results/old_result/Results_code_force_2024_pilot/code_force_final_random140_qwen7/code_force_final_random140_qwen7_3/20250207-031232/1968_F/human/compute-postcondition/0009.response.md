Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `x` is a list with its last element being `x[-1] ^ i ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` includes the length of `x` minus one (i.e., `len(x) - 1`), and `i` is the next element from `a` after the operation.**

Explanation: The code appends `x[-1] ^ i` to the list `x`. Since `x[-1]` is already `x[-1] ^ i`, appending `x[-1] ^ i` is equivalent to appending `x[-1] ^ i ^ i`. Given that `a` contains at least one element, `x` is a list with its last element being `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` includes the length of `x` minus one, and `i` is the next element from `a` after the operation, these conditions remain valid after the operation.
