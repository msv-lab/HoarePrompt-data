Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the smallest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists.**

Explanation: The code `lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1` calls the function `func_2` with `inds[x[r]]` as the first argument and a lambda function as the second argument. This lambda function checks if an element is less than `l`. The `or -1` part ensures that if no such index is found, `lower` is set to `-1`. The values of `i`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
