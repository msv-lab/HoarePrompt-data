Postcondition: `i` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][inds[x[l - 1]][upper]]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`, and either `upper` is greater than `lower` and `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, or `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, or `upper` is greater than `r`, or `lower` is greater than or equal to `l`.
