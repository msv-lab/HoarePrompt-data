Output State: `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list where each element is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds[x[-1]]` is a list containing all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will be exhausted since it is iterated over completely. For each element `i` in `a`, the variable `x` appends the current value of `x[-1]` bitwise XORed with `i`. This means that `x` will contain the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to the current step. The dictionary `inds` maps each value in `x` to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`, which will include all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1 because each new value in `x` is added immediately after the previous value.
