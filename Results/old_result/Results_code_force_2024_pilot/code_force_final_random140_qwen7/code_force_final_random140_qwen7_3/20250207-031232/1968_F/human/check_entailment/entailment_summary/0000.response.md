Reasoning:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of `n` and `q`, followed by an array `a` of length `n` and `q` queries.

2. **Processing Each Test Case (`func_3`)**:
   - For each test case, the array `a` is processed to compute the prefix XOR values and store them in the list `x`. This helps in efficiently checking the cumulative XOR of any subarray.
   - A dictionary `inds` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This allows quick lookups for the required conditions.
   - For each query, the solution checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` has a cumulative XOR of zero, which would mean it can be divided into two equal parts with the same XOR.
   - If the cumulative XOR from `l-1` to `r` is zero, the subarray is directly marked as interesting.
   - Otherwise, binary search (`func_2`) is used to find the appropriate indices that satisfy the condition for dividing the subarray into two parts with equal XOR values.
   - The solution ensures that the indices found by the binary search lie within the bounds of the query and checks if they form a valid division.

Given the detailed implementation and the correctness of the logic, the provided solution meets the requirements of the problem accurately.
