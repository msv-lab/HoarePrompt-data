Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element from `a` after the operation, `x` contains an additional element which is the bitwise XOR of the last element of `x` and the next element `i` from `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `x` the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` (denoted as `x[-1]`) and the next element `i` from `a`. Since `a` contains at least one element and `i` is the next element from `a` after the operation, `x` will have an additional element that is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`.
