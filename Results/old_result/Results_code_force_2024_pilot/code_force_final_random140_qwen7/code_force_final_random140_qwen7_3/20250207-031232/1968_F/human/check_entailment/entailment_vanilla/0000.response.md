### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires checking if a subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the XOR of each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The XOR of a prefix of the array can help identify if a subarray is interesting.
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, it can always be divided into parts with the same XOR (e.g., each element is its own part).
   - If the XOR of the subarray is non-zero, we need to check if there exists a split point where the XOR values match.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function reads space-separated integers from input and applies a cast function.
   - **func_2:** This function performs binary search to find the first index where a condition is met.
   - **func_3:** This function processes the main logic:
     - Reads `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the array `a`.
     - Computes the prefix XOR values and stores indices in a dictionary.
     - For each query, checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
     - Uses binary search to find valid split points.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation:** 
     - Compute `x[i] = x[i-1] ^ a[i]` and store indices in `inds`.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - Check if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero.
     - Use binary search to find valid split points.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the prefix XOR calculation and uses binary search to find valid split points.
   - It checks the XOR of the subarray and uses the indices to validate the split points.
   - The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution for determining if a subarray is interesting according to the given problem description.
