Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)` and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `q`, `l`, or `r`, and the `continue` statement does not affect their values, these variables retain their initial states. The `continue` statement itself does not change any variable values but indicates that the loop continues.
