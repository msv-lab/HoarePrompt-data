Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the index found by `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` or -1 if no such index exists, `lower` is the value of `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `lower` to be the element at the index `lower + 1` in the list `inds[x[r]]`. However, since the initial value of `lower` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
