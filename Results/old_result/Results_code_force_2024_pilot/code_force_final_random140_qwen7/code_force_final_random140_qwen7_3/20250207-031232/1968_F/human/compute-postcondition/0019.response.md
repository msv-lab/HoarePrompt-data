Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`.
- The value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the value of `x[r]`.

The `print('Yes')` statement simply prints the string 'Yes'. Since no other variables or objects are referenced in this print statement, the output is solely determined by the string itself.

Output: **Yes**
