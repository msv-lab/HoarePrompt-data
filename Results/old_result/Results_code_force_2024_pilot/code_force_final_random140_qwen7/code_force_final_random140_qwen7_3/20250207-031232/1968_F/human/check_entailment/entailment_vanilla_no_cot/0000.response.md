Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is defined to use `map` with `cast`, but it does not handle the conversion of the input properly. It should directly read and convert the input values without using `map`.

2. **Predicate Logic in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the index where the predicate holds true. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It should check if the middle element satisfies the predicate and adjust the search range accordingly. Also, the return value should be checked more carefully.

3. **XOR Calculation and Index Storage**: The code calculates the cumulative XOR values and stores indices in the dictionary `inds`. This part seems correct, but there are potential issues with how the indices are used later.

4. **Query Handling Logic**: The logic for handling the queries is flawed. Specifically, the way indices are used to determine if a subarray is interesting is incorrect. The current implementation checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is interesting.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None

def func_3():
    (n, q) = func_1()
    a = list(func_1())
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1()
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        
        if lower != -1 and upper != -1 and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage
func_3()
```

This corrected version should address the issues and correctly determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description.
