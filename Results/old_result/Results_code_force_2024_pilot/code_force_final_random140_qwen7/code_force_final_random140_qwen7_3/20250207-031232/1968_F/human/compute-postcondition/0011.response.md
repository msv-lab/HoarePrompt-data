Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `a` and `i` is the next element from `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` contains at least one element.
   - `x` is a list with its last element being `x[-1] ^ i ^ i`.
   - `inds[x[-1]]` includes the length of `x` plus one (i.e., `len(x)`).
   - `i` is the next element from `a` after the operation.

4. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element from `a` after the operation, `i` will change to the next element in `a`.
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element from `a` after the operation.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element from `a` after the operation**.
