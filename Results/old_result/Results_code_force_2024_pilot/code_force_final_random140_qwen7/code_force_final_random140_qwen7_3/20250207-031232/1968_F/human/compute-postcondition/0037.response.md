Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `i` is 1.
2. `q` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
3. `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, but the function definition is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
4. `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, similarly, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`.

Given this information, the only thing that is explicitly printed is the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
