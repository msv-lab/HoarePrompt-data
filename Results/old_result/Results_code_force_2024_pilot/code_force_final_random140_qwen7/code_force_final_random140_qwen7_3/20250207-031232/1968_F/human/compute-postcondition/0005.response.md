Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The variable `i` is being assigned values from the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `a`**: 
   - `inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `q` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element is the result of calling `func_1(int)`.
   - `l` and `r` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq l < r \leq n\) for each query.
   - `x` is a list containing the single element 0.
   - `inds[0]` is a list containing the element 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the elements of `a`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a`. We need to ensure that `a` is not empty so that the loop can execute at least once.
   - The other variables (`inds`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the list `a` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
