Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an argument that is an integer (the value of `int` is not specified, so we keep it as `int`). The function returns two values, which are assigned to `l` and `r` respectively. The initial values of `i` and `q` remain unchanged.
