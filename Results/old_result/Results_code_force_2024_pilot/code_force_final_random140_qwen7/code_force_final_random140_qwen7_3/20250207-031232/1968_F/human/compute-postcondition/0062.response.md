Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `a` of integers, and for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it returns a result based on the subarray of `a` from index `l` to `r`-1.**

Note: The function does not have any parameters listed in the provided function signature (`def func_3():`), but it seems to process a list `a` and handle queries defined by `l` and `r`. The functionality involves iterating over a specified subarray of `a` defined by `l` and `r` for each query and returning some result based on that subarray.
