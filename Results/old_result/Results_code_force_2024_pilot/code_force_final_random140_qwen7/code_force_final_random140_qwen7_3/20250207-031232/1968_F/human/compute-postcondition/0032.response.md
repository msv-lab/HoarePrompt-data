Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are the return values from `func_1(int)`.
- `upper` is defined as `inds[x[l - 1]][inds[x[l - 1]][upper]]`.
- `lower` is defined as `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`.
- Either `upper <= lower` or `upper > r` or `lower >= l`.

The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

Given this, the print statement will output the string "No" regardless of the values of the other variables because the print statement itself does not depend on the values of `l`, `r`, `upper`, or `lower`. It directly prints the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
