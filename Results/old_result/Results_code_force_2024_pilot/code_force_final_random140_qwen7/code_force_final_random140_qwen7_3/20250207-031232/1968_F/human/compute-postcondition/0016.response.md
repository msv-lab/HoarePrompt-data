Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(q)`.
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter.
   - The variable `q` defines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables:**
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `x` is a list where each element is the cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in `a` up to that point.
   - `inds[x[-1]]` is a list containing all indices from 0 to the length of `x` - 1.

3. **Understand the Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates `q` times.
   - In each iteration, `i` takes values from 0 to `q-1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop will iterate `q` times, `i` must start at 0 and increment until it reaches `q-1`.
   - The initial state of `a` being empty and `x` being initialized appropriately will ensure the loop can proceed.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `q`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0**
