Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `q` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, but since the function and its parameters are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
- `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, similarly, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`.
- `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, where `inds` is a two-dimensional list or array, and `x` is a list or array. Since the exact values of `inds` and `x` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `upper`.
- `lower` is the value of `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`, again, without knowing the exact values of `inds` and `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `lower`.

Given this information, the only part of the code that is certain to execute is the `print('No')` statement.

Output: **No**
