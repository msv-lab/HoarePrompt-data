Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `q` is greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed for the print statement.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, but the function itself is not defined, so we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
- `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, similarly, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`.
- `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, where `inds` is an assumed structure (likely a list of lists), `x` is an assumed list, and `upper` is an assumed index. Since the exact values of `x` and `inds` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `upper`.
- `lower` is the value of `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`, where `inds` is again an assumed structure, `x` is an assumed list, and `lower` is an assumed index. Similarly, we cannot determine the exact value of `lower`.

However, the print statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
