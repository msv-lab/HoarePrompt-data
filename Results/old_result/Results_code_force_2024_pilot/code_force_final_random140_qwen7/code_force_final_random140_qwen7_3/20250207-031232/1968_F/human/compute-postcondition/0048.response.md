Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `q`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue if `i < q`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `q` is greater than 0
   - `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`
   - `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`
   - The condition `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `l <= lower <= r` holds true.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `q` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `q` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `q`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0**
