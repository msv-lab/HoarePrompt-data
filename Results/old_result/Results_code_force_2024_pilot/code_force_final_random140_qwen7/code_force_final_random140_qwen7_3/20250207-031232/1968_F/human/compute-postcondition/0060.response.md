Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is the value of `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper` is greater than `lower` and `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.**
