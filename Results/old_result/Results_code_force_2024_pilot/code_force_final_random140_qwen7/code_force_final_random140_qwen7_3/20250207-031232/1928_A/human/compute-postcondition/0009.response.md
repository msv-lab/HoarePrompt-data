Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state provides the values and conditions for the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, `i` is set to 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, and `b` is an integer from input. Additionally, it is stated that either `a` is odd or `b` is odd. 

The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string 'YES', regardless of the values of `a` and `b` as long as one of them is odd. Therefore, the output is **YES**.
