Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, the input was split and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively. If `a` and `b` are both odd and `a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`, the condition is not specified further. Otherwise, the condition is met if either `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`.
