Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly identifies when Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle based on the problem statement.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can potentially form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(n\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints 'NO'.
   - It also checks if the condition \(a / 2 == b\) and \(b\) is odd, or \(b / 2 == a\) and \(a\) is odd. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - In all other cases, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program correctly prints 'NO'.
   - When \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the program should generally print 'YES', but there are specific edge cases where the program incorrectly prints 'NO'.

4. **Specific Edge Case**:
   - Consider the case where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\). Here, \(a\) is even, but the program still prints 'NO' because it does not handle the general even case properly. However, according to the problem statement, if either dimension is even, Bob can form another rectangle. Thus, the program should print 'YES' for this case.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases where \(a\) or \(b\) is even. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
