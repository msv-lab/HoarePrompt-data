### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Conditions for "NO"**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If they are, it prints 'NO'. This condition is correct because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle will always result in two rectangles with odd dimensions, and no combination of these smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle with even dimensions.
   - The program also checks if `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`. These conditions are meant to check specific cases where the original rectangle's dimensions are such that no new rectangle can be formed after cutting. However, these conditions are overly restrictive and do not cover all cases where a new rectangle cannot be formed.

3. **Conditions for "YES"**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This means the program assumes that if the previous conditions are not met, a new rectangle can always be formed. However, this assumption is incorrect because there are other scenarios where a new rectangle cannot be formed, such as when both dimensions are even but the resulting smaller rectangles cannot form a new unique rectangle.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: \(1 \times 1\)
  - Both dimensions are 1 (odd), so the program prints 'NO' correctly.

- **Test Case 2**: \(2 \times 1\)
  - One dimension is 2 (even), one is 1 (odd), so the program should print 'YES' because it can be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles and reformed into a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle, but the program prints 'NO'.

- **Test Case 3**: \(2 \times 6\)
  - The program correctly prints 'YES' because it can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and reformed into a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

- **Test Case 4**: \(3 \times 2\)
  - The program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and reformed into a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.

- **Test Case 5**: \(2 \times 2\)
  - The program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles and reformed into a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle.

- **Test Case 6**: \(2 \times 4\)
  - The program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and reformed into a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.

- **Test Case 7**: \(6 \times 3\)
  - The program correctly prints 'NO' because it cannot be cut in a way that allows forming a new unique rectangle.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following conditions:
1. If both dimensions are odd, the answer is 'NO'.
2. If one dimension is even and the other is odd, the answer is 'YES'.
3. If both dimensions are even, we need to check if the dimensions can be divided in a way that forms a new unique rectangle.

### Correct Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where one dimension is even and the other is odd correctly. The correct approach is to print 'YES' in such cases, and 'NO' only when both dimensions are odd. 

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
