Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where either \(a\) or \(b\) is equal to 1. According to the problem description, a \(1 \times 1\) rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, and thus, no other rectangle can be formed from it. However, the current implementation does not account for this specific case.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1`

The expected output is `"No"`, but the program will incorrectly output `"YES"` because it does not check if both \(a\) and \(b\) are 1. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
