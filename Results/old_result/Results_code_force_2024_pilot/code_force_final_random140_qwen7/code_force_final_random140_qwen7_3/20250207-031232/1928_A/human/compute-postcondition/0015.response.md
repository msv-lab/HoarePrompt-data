Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, the input was split and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.**

In this case, the code takes two integers from input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
