Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers from input, and the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` must be met, meaning both `a` and `b` are odd.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the condition involving `a` and `b` does not affect the print statement itself, and the print statement is just a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
