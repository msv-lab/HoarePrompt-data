You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. At this point, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `a` and `b` are integers from the last input provided within the loop. The final state of `a` and `b` will depend on the conditions checked in the loop:
    #
    #- If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, the loop will print 'NO' for each iteration where this condition holds true.
    #- If the condition `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0) or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)` is met for any iteration, the loop will print 'NO' and will not proceed further with the current pair of `a` and `b`.
    #- If none of the above conditions are met for any iteration, the loop will print 'YES' for the last valid pair of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is characterized by `i` being equal to `n`, and the values of `a` and `b` reflecting the last input pair processed by the loop, with the last printed statement being either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated throughout the loop's iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
