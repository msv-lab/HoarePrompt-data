Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle for each test case.

2. **Conditions for "NO":**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO'. This condition is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be divided into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - The program also checks if either `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'. These conditions are not entirely correct and need further analysis.

3. **Conditions for "YES":**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This implies that the rectangle can always be divided into two smaller rectangles, which is not necessarily true in all cases.

### Detailed Analysis of Conditions:

- **Condition 1: Both `a` and `b` are odd.**
  - This condition is correct. An odd-sized rectangle cannot be divided into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

- **Condition 2: `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`.**
  - This condition is incorrect. Let's consider examples:
    - If `a = 2` and `b = 1`, `a / 2 == b` is false, but the program should still allow forming a new rectangle.
    - If `a = 3` and `b = 2`, `b / 2 == a` is false, but the program should still allow forming a new rectangle.
  - These conditions incorrectly restrict the ability to form new rectangles.

### Correct Conditions:

To correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle, we need to check if at least one of the dimensions can be divided by 2 without leaving an odd-sized rectangle. Hereâ€™s the corrected logic:

- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always form another rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has incorrect conditions for determining when Bob can form another rectangle. The corrected program checks if at least one of the dimensions is even, which is the correct approach.

**Correctness: False**

The original program needs to be revised as shown above.
