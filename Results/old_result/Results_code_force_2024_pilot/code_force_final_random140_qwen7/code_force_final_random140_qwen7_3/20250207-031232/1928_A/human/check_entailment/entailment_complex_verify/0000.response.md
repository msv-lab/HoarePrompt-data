### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- The program should determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle.
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and these smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, or if \(a / 2 = b\) and \(b\) is odd, or if \(b / 2 = a\) and \(a\) is odd, the program should print "NO".
- Otherwise, the program should print "YES".

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd using the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "NO".
   - The program also checks if \(a / 2 == b\) and \(b\) is odd, or if \(b / 2 == a\) and \(a\) is odd. If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "YES".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1.
   - When both \(a\) and \(b\) are 1, the program incorrectly prints "YES" instead of "NO".

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The annotated code correctly describes the program's behavior and the conditions under which it prints "YES" or "NO".
- The final state of the program is correctly explained, indicating that the program processes all test cases and prints the final result for the last tested pair of \(a\) and \(b\).

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program fails to handle the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are 1.
- The program incorrectly prints "YES" for the test case `1 1`.

#### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to add a condition to check if both \(a\) and \(b\) are 1 before checking the other conditions.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == 1 and b == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

With this correction, the program now correctly handles the edge case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are 1.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrections made, the original assessment was accurate. The program initially failed to handle the edge case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are 1, but after adding the necessary condition, the program now meets the requirements.

**Final: True**
