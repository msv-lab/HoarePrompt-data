You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. At this point, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `a` and `b` are integers from the last input provided within the loop. The final state of `a` and `b` will depend on the conditions checked in the loop:
    #
    #- If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, the loop will print 'NO' for each iteration where this condition holds true.
    #- If the condition `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0) or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)` is met for any iteration, the loop will print 'NO' and will not proceed further with the current pair of `a` and `b`.
    #- If none of the above conditions are met for any iteration, the loop will print 'YES' for the last valid pair of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is characterized by `i` being equal to `n`, and the values of `a` and `b` reflecting the last input pair processed by the loop, with the last printed statement being either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated throughout the loop's iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it takes two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) as input and prints 'YES' if neither \(a\) nor \(b\) are both odd and do not satisfy the specific divisibility conditions, otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final result for the last tested pair of \(a\) and \(b\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where either \(a\) or \(b\) is equal to 1. According to the problem description, a \(1 \times 1\) rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, and thus, no other rectangle can be formed from it. However, the current implementation does not account for this specific case.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1`

The expected output is `"No"`, but the program will incorrectly output `"YES"` because it does not check if both \(a\) and \(b\) are 1. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
