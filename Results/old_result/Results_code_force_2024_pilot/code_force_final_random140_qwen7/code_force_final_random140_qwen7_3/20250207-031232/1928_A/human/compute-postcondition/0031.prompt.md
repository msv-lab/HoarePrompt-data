Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if the condition `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0) or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)` is true, then either `a` is even and `b` is odd, or `b` is even and `a` is odd. In all other cases, either `a` remains odd or `b` remains odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, the input was split and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is met. Otherwise, the condition is met if either `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, and the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is met if both `a` and `b` are odd, otherwise the condition is met if either `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
