Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `a` is an integer from input
   - `b` is an integer from input
   - The input was split and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.
   - The condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is met if both `a` and `b` are odd.
   - Alternatively, the condition is met if either `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (the next value).
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be updated to 2.
   - `n` must be a non-negative integer greater than 1.

Given these points, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, the input was split and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively, and the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is met if both `a` and `b` are odd, otherwise the condition is met if either `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`.**
