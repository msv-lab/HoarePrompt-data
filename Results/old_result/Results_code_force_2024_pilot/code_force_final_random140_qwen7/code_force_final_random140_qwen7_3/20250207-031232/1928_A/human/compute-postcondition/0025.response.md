Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, but its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement.
- `a` and `b` are integers from input, and the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` must be met, meaning both `a` and `b` are odd numbers.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'NO' without any dependence on the values of `a` or `b`.

Output: **NO**
