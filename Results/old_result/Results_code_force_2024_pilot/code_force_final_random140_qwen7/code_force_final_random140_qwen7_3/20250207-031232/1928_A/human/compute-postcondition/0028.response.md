Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, and the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is met if both `a` and `b` are odd, otherwise the condition is met if either `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0`, or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`. Since the if and else parts are identical, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of whether the if or else condition is met.**
