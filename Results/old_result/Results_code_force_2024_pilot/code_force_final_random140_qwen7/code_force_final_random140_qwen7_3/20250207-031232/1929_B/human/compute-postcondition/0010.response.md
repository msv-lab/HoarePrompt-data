Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `_` is not used in the code, so its value remains unchanged. The variable `t` is also not used in the code, so its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the only variables affected are `n` and `k`, which are assigned the values of the two integers input by the user.
