Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer input split from the user.
- `k` is the second integer input split from the user.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

Here, `ceil(k / 2)` computes the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer if the result is not already an integer.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. However, we know that `k` is an integer input from the user.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `k` divided by 2.

Output: **ceil(k / 2)**
