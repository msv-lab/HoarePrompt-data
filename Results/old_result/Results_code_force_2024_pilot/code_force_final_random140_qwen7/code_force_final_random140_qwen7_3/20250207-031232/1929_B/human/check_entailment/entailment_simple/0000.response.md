Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case based on the conditions provided.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program checks if `k` is even and if `k // 2` is odd.
   - If the condition `k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1` is true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

Let's verify this logic against the examples provided:

- **Example 1**: For `n = 3` and `k = 4`, the minimum number of cells to color is `2`. This is because we can color 2 cells to ensure 4 diagonals are covered. The logic works here since `4 % 2 == 0` and `4 // 2 == 2` (which is even), but the condition `k // 2 % 2 == 1` fails, so it should use `ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
- **Example 2**: For `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the minimum number of cells to color is `2`. The logic works here since `3 % 2 != 0`, so it uses `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
- **Example 3**: For `n = 3` and `k = 10`, the minimum number of cells to color is `6`. The logic works here since `10 % 2 == 0` and `10 // 2 == 5` (which is odd), so it prints `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
- **Example 4**: For `n = 3` and `k = 9`, the minimum number of cells to color is `5`. The logic works here since `9 % 2 != 0`, so it uses `ceil(9 / 2) = 5`.
- **Example 5**: For `n = 4` and `k = 7`, the minimum number of cells to color is `4`. The logic works here since `7 % 2 != 0`, so it uses `ceil(7 / 2) = 4`.
- **Example 6**: For `n = 7` and `k = 11`, the minimum number of cells to color is `6`. The logic works here since `11 % 2 != 0`, so it uses `ceil(11 / 2) = 6`.
- **Example 7**: For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the minimum number of cells to color is `2`. The logic works here since `3 % 2 != 0`, so it uses `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.

Given that the logic correctly handles all the provided examples and the conditions specified in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
