Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `k` is even and if `k // 2` is odd.
   - If this condition is true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Diagonal Analysis**:
   - A square grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
   - We need to ensure at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of colored cells.

### Detailed Reasoning

- **Case 1**: When `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd.
  - If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, we can color cells in such a way that exactly `k // 2 + 1` cells are needed.
  - This is because each diagonal can be uniquely identified and we can strategically place the cells to satisfy the condition.

- **Case 2**: When `k` is not in the form where `k // 2` is odd.
  - In other cases, we need to use the ceiling function to ensure we meet the requirement of at least `k` diagonals having at least one colored cell.
  - The ceiling function ensures that we round up to the nearest integer, which is necessary when `k // 2` is even.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the examples provided:

1. **Test Case 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
   - \( k // 2 = 2 \) (even), but `2 % 2 == 0`, so we use `ceil(k / 2) = 2`.
   - Correct answer: 2.

2. **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
   - \( k // 2 = 1.5 \) (odd), so we use `k // 2 + 1 = 2`.
   - Correct answer: 2.

3. **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
   - \( k // 2 = 5 \) (odd), so we use `k // 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - Correct answer: 6.

4. **Test Case 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
   - \( k // 2 = 4.5 \) (even), so we use `ceil(k / 2) = 5`.
   - Correct answer: 5.

5. **Test Case 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
   - \( k // 2 = 3.5 \) (odd), so we use `k // 2 + 1 = 4`.
   - Correct answer: 4.

6. **Test Case 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
   - \( k // 2 = 5.5 \) (odd), so we use `k // 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - Correct answer: 6.

7. **Test Case 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
   - \( k // 2 = 1.5 \) (odd), so we use `ceil(k / 2) = 2`.
   - Correct answer: 2.

### Conclusion

After verifying the conditions and examples, the program correctly handles the cases and produces the expected results.
