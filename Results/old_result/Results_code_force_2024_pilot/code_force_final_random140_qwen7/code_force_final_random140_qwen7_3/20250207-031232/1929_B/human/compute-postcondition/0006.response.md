Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer, and it satisfies either `k % 2 != 0` or `k // 2 % 2 == 0`.

We need to determine the value of `ceil(k / 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `k % 2 != 0` means `k` is an odd number.
   - The condition `k // 2 % 2 == 0` means when `k` is divided by 2 and the result is taken modulo 2, it should be 0. This implies that `k // 2` is even.

2. **Implication of Conditions**:
   - If `k` is odd, then `k // 2` would be a non-integer (since dividing an odd number by 2 results in a non-integer), but the condition `k // 2 % 2 == 0` suggests that `k // 2` must be an even integer. Therefore, the only way both conditions can be true is if `k` is an odd number such that `k // 2` is an even integer.

3. **Value of `ceil(k / 2)`**:
   - For an odd number `k`, `k // 2` is an integer. Since `k` is odd, `k // 2` is an even integer.
   - The ceiling of an integer is the integer itself. Therefore, `ceil(k / 2)` will be `k // 2`.

### Conclusion:
Since `k` is an odd number and `k // 2` is an even integer, `ceil(k / 2)` will simply be the integer value of `k // 2`.

Output: **k // 2**
