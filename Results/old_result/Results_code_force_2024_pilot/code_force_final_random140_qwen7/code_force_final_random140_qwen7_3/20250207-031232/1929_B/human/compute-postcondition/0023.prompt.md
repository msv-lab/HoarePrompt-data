You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is set to `t-1` after the loop completes, `n` retains its value from the first input, and `k` retains its value from the last input provided during the loop's iterations. No further changes are made to these variables within the loop, so their values persist based on the last inputs received.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1000, `_` will be equal to the total number of iterations minus one (i.e., `t-1`), `n` will be the `n` value from the first input, and `k` will be the `k` value from the last input processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers within the ranges 2 to 10^8 and 1 to 4n - 2 respectively. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
