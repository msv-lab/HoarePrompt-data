Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the second integer input split from the user)**

Explanation:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `_` is explicitly given as 2, but this variable is also not used in the print statement.
- `n` is the first integer input split from the user, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `k` is the second integer input split from the user, and it is used in the expression `k // 2 + 1`.

The expression `k // 2 + 1` computes the integer division of `k` by 2 and then adds 1 to the result. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is the second integer input from the user.
