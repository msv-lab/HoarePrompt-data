Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers within the ranges 2 to 10^8 and 1 to 4n - 2 respectively. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
