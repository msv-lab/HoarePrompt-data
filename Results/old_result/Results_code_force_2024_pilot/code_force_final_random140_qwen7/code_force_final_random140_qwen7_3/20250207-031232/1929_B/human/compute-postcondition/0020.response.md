Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `k` is the second integer input split from the user. If any of the `k` values are even and the result of `k // 2` is odd, they will be printed as `k // 2 + 1`, otherwise, they will be printed as `ceil(k / 2)`. The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop executions, and the values of `_`, `n`, and `k` are updated based on the inputs provided during each iteration but do not affect the final value of `t`.
