Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `_` (underscore) is still set to 0. The values of `n` and `k` depend on the input provided by the user.
