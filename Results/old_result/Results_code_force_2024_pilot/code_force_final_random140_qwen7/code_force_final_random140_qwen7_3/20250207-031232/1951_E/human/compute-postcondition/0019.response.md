Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is the integer value of half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even, then:
- If `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, `a` is 3.
- Otherwise, `a` is 4.

If the length of `ch` is odd, then:
- If `func_1(ch[:b])` evaluates to True, `a` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `a` is set to 2.
