Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not solve the problem correctly. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. However, it only checks the first half of the string against the reversed second half for even-length strings and the first half plus one character for odd-length strings. This is not a comprehensive check for palindromes. It will incorrectly identify some non-palindromic strings as palindromic.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine how many non-palindromic parts a string can be split into. However, its logic is flawed:
   - It incorrectly handles the middle character for odd-length strings.
   - It does not actually perform the partitioning required by the problem statement.
   - It returns a value (`a`) without using it to actually partition the string or determine if a valid partition exists.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Check if a string is a palindrome.
- Partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
- Ensure that the partitioning is valid according to the problem constraints.

Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach to solving the problem:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def find_partition(s):
    n = len(s)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        j = i + 1
        while j <= n and not is_palindrome(s[i:j]):
            j += 1
        if j == n + 1:
            return None  # No valid partition found
        yield s[i:j]
        i = j

def solve_test_case(s):
    parts = list(find_partition(s))
    if parts:
        return 'YES', len(parts), ' '.join(parts)
    else:
        return 'NO'

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        result = solve_test_case(s)
        results.append(result)

    for result in results:
        print(result[0])
        if result[0] == 'YES':
            print(result[1])
            print(result[2])
```

This solution:
- Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- Attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
- Returns "YES" with the number of parts and the parts themselves if a valid partition exists, otherwise returns "NO".
