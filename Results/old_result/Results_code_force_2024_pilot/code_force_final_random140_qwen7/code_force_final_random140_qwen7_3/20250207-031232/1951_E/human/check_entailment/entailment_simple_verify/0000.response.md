### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome.
- It splits the string into two halves and compares them.
- If the string is even-length, it checks if the first half is equal to the reverse of the second half.
- If the string is odd-length, it checks if the first half (up to the middle character) is equal to the reverse of the second half (starting from the middle character).

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function determines how many parts a string can be split into such that none of the parts are palindromic.
- It uses the result of `func_1` to decide the number of parts:
  - If the string is even-length and the first half is a palindrome, it returns 3.
  - If the string is even-length and the first half is not a palindrome, it returns 4.
  - If the string is odd-length and the first half is a palindrome, it returns 1.
  - If the string is odd-length and the first half is not a palindrome, it returns 2.

#### Main Logic:
- The main logic checks if the entire string `s` is a single character repeated (`s == s[0] * len(s)`).
- If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because a single repeated character forms a palindrome.
- It also checks if the string can be split into two parts where one part is a palindrome.
- If neither condition is met, it calls `func_2` to determine the number of parts needed.
- Based on the result of `func_2`, it attempts to split the string into non-palindromic parts and prints the result.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example test case:
```
Input:
sinktheyacht
```

- `func_1("sinktheyacht")` returns `False` because "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome.
- `func_2("sinktheyacht")` returns `0` because the length is greater than 3 and `func_1` returned `False`.
- Since `a == 0`, the string is printed as a single part: `['sinktheyacht']`.

This matches the expected output:
```
YES
1
sinktheyacht
```

Now, let's consider another example:
```
Input:
lllllllll
```

- `func_1("lllllllll")` returns `True` because "lllllllll" is a palindrome.
- `func_2("lllllllll")` returns `1` because the length is even and `func_1` returned `True`.
- Since `a == 1`, the string is split into two parts: `['l', 'llllllllll']`.
- However, "llllllllll" is still a palindrome, so the logic fails to correctly partition the string.

Based on this analysis, the provided code does not correctly handle all cases and fails to partition strings into non-palindromic substrings in certain scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to handle all edge cases and does not always produce the correct partitioning of the string into non-palindromic substrings.
