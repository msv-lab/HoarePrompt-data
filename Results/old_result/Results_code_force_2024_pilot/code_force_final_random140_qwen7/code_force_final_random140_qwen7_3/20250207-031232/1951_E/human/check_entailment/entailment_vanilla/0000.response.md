Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It works correctly for checking if a string is a palindrome:
     - If the length of `ch` is even, it splits the string into two halves and checks if they are equal when reversed.
     - If the length of `ch` is odd, it does the same but considers the middle character separately.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to determine how many non-palindromic substrings a string can be split into.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed:
     - It checks the first half of the string using `func_1`.
     - Depending on whether the string length is even or odd, it returns a value without considering the entire string's structure.
     - Specifically, it does not ensure that the entire string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Detailed Issues with `func_2`

- **Case 1**: If the string length is even and the first half is a palindrome (`func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`), it returns `3`. This is incorrect because a single non-palindromic substring can be formed from the entire string.
- **Case 2**: If the string length is even and the first half is not a palindrome, it returns `4`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider if the second half can form a non-palindromic substring.
- **Case 3**: If the string length is odd and the first half is a palindrome, it returns `1`. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of splitting the string into more than one non-palindromic substring.
- **Case 4**: If the string length is odd and the first half is not a palindrome, it returns `2`. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the entire string's structure.

### Example Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: `sinktheyacht`
  - Expected output: `YES 1 sinktheyacht`
  - Actual output: `NO` (due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)

- **Test Case 2**: `lllllllll`
  - Expected output: `NO`
  - Actual output: `NO` (correct, but due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)

- **Test Case 3**: `uwuowouwu`
  - Expected output: `YES 3 uw uow ouwu`
  - Actual output: `NO` (due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
