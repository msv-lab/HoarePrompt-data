### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The code correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.
   - It reads the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The code checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome. If so, it sets `T1` to `False`, indicating that the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If the string is not a single repeated substring (like `llllllll`), it proceeds to further checks.

3. **Partition Logic**:
   - The code uses `func_1` and `func_2` to determine how to partition the string.
   - `func_1` checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
   - `func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to determine the number of partitions needed (`a`).

4. **Partition Execution**:
   - Based on the value of `a` returned by `func_2`, the code attempts to split the string into the required number of non-palindromic substrings.
   - The logic for splitting the string is somewhat complex but generally aims to ensure that each resulting substring is not a palindrome.

5. **Output**:
   - If a valid partition is found, the code prints "YES", the number of parts, and the parts themselves.
   - If no valid partition can be found, it prints "NO".

### Specific Analysis:

- **Test Case 1 (`sinktheyacht`)**:
  - The string is not a palindrome and is not a repeated substring, so the code should find a valid partition.
  - The code correctly identifies that the string itself is a valid partition and prints "YES 1 sinktheyacht".

- **Test Case 2 (`llllllll`)**:
  - The string is a repeated substring, so no valid partition exists.
  - The code correctly identifies this and prints "NO".

- **Test Case 3 (`uwuowouwu`)**:
  - The string is not a palindrome and can be split into "uw uow ouwu".
  - The code correctly identifies this and prints "YES 3 uw uow ouwu".

### Conclusion:

The code appears to handle all test cases correctly based on the provided examples and the logic implemented. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to work as intended to determine the validity of the partitions.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
