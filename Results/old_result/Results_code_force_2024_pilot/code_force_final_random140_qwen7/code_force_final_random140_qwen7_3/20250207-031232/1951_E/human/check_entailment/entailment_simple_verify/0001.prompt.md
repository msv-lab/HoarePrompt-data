You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It works correctly for checking if a string is a palindrome:
     - If the length of `ch` is even, it splits the string into two halves and checks if they are equal when reversed.
     - If the length of `ch` is odd, it does the same but considers the middle character separately.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to determine how many non-palindromic substrings a string can be split into.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed:
     - It checks the first half of the string using `func_1`.
     - Depending on whether the string length is even or odd, it returns a value without considering the entire string's structure.
     - Specifically, it does not ensure that the entire string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Detailed Issues with `func_2`

- **Case 1**: If the string length is even and the first half is a palindrome (`func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`), it returns `3`. This is incorrect because a single non-palindromic substring can be formed from the entire string.
- **Case 2**: If the string length is even and the first half is not a palindrome, it returns `4`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider if the second half can form a non-palindromic substring.
- **Case 3**: If the string length is odd and the first half is a palindrome, it returns `1`. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of splitting the string into more than one non-palindromic substring.
- **Case 4**: If the string length is odd and the first half is not a palindrome, it returns `2`. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the entire string's structure.

### Example Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: `sinktheyacht`
  - Expected output: `YES 1 sinktheyacht`
  - Actual output: `NO` (due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)

- **Test Case 2**: `lllllllll`
  - Expected output: `NO`
  - Actual output: `NO` (correct, but due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)

- **Test Case 3**: `uwuowouwu`
  - Expected output: `YES 3 uw uow ouwu`
  - Actual output: `NO` (due to incorrect logic in `func_2`)

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
