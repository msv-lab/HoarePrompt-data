The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `p` must satisfy this condition.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is greater than 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `k` must be greater than or equal to `i`
- `s` is equal to `i`
- `d` is 0
- `h` is now `n - 1`
- `p` is 2
- `f` is `k - g`, and `g` is 1

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the current value of `p` against the condition `p <= i - 1`.

Given:
- `p` is 2
- `i` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Since `p` is currently 2, `i` must be greater than 3 (because 2 <= i - 1 implies i - 1 >= 2, hence i >= 3).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure that `p <= i - 1` holds true.

State: **`i` must be greater than 3**
