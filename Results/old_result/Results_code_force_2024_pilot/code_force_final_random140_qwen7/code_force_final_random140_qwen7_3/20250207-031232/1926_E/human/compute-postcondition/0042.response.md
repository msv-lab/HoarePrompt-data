Postcondition: **`i` is the total number of iterations, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` and the series of terms resulting from the operation `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `y` is 2 if `k > (n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**
