Output State: **`i` must be greater than or equal to 4; `p` is 3; `h` is `h` minus the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2; `g` is `g` plus the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2.**

Explanation: The code `h -= (h + 1) // 2` updates the value of `h` by subtracting the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2 from its current value. The integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2 is a specific calculation that affects `h`. The value of `g` remains unchanged as it was updated previously but is not altered by this line of code. The conditions and values of `i` and `p` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
