Output State: `i` is equal to 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `s` is equal to 4, `d` is 0, `h` is equal to 0, `p` is 4, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `d` reaches 0, which means the loop condition `d > 0` is no longer satisfied. Given that the loop runs until `d` is reduced to 0 and considering the pattern of decrementing `h` and incrementing `g`, the final state of the loop shows that `i` (which represents the number of iterations) is 4. Consequently, `s` equals `i`, making `s` also 4. Since `d` is 0, the decrement of `h` stops, and `h` becomes 0. The variable `p` increments by 1 with each iteration, so after 4 iterations, `p` is 4. The variable `g` is incremented by `(h + 1) // 2` in each iteration, and after 3 iterations, `g` is 3.
