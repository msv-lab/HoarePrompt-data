Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` (which is `d`) is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `d` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `s` is `k + (d + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `d`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. `n` is still greater than 0, `k` is still an input integer, `d` is still `(d + 1) // 2`, and `s` is still `k + (d + 1) // 2`.
