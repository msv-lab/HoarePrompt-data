Output State: **`i` is equal to 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `s` is equal to 4, `d` is 0, `h` is equal to 0, `p` is 4, `f` is 1, `y` is 8.**

Explanation: The code calculates `y` as `2 ** (i - 1) * f`. Given `i` is 4 and `f` is 1, the expression simplifies to `2 ** (4 - 1) * 1`, which is `2 ** 3 * 1 = 8`. All other variables remain unchanged.
