Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer and it is given that `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`
- `s` is 0
- `d` is equal to `n`
- `h` is equal to `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0

The expression to be evaluated and printed is `2 * k - 1`.

Since the value of `k` is not explicitly given, but it is stated that `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, we can represent `k` symbolically. However, the exact value of `k` does not affect the expression `2 * k - 1` because it is directly used in the calculation.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an input integer such that k <= (n + 1) // 2)**
