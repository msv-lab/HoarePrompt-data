Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the loop will run `n` times**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them by whitespace, and converts each to an integer. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The initial state that the loop will run `int(input())` times is now updated to say the loop will run `n` times. The values of `n` and `k` are specific input integers, and the loop execution count is now determined by `n`.
