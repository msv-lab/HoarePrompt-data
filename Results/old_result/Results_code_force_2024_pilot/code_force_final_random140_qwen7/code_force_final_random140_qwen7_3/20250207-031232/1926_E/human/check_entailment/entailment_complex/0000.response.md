Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case with `n` and `k`.

2. **Odd Card Placement**: The program correctly identifies that the first part of the sequence consists of all odd numbers from 1 to `n`. This part is handled by the condition `if k > (n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Even Card Placement**: For the even-numbered positions (which are multiples of 2, 4, 6, etc., derived from odd multipliers), the program attempts to calculate the position of the `k`-th card by determining how many odd-numbered blocks have been placed before the current block and then calculating the exact position within the current block.

4. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The variable `i` counts the number of complete odd-numbered blocks (each block containing `(d + 1) // 2` elements).
   - The variable `s` accumulates the count of elements placed so far.
   - The variable `d` decreases by the number of elements in each completed block.
   - The variable `g` accumulates the count of elements placed in the first half of the sequence.
   - The variable `f` calculates the remaining elements to place after the first half.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `2 ** (i - 1) * f`, which is supposed to give the correct position in the current block.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to the number of odd-numbered cards (`(n + 1) // 2`) by directly computing `2 * k - 1`.

Given the detailed analysis, the logic appears to be correct for the described problem. The program correctly identifies whether `k` falls into the first half (odd cards) or the second half (even cards derived from odd multipliers) and calculates the correct position accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
