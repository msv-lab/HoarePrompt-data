Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is (d + 1) // 2, `d` is now d - (d + 1) // 2, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g`) remain unchanged.
