Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `i` must be greater than 4.
   - `h` is equal to half of its original value (`(h + 1) // 2`).
   - `p` is increased by 1.

3. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `p` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, `p` must be less than `i - 1` before the increase.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The current value of `p` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `p` must be less than `i - 1` before this increment.
   - Given that `p` is increased by 1, the new value of `p` would be the old value of `p` plus 1. Hence, the old value of `p` must be less than `i - 2`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that the old value of `p` (before the increment) was less than `i - 2`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `p` such that it was less than `i - 2` before the increment.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` must be greater than 4; `h` is equal to half of its original value (`(h + 1) // 2`); `p` must be less than `i - 2`**
