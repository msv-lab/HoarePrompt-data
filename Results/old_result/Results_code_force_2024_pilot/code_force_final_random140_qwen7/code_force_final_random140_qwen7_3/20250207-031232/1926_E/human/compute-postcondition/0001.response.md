Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int**.

This means that the code has taken two inputs from the user separated by a space, converted them to integers, and assigned them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
