Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes a variable `s` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or `k`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `n` and `k` while adding the new variable `s` with the value 0.
