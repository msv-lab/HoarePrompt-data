Output State: **`i` must be greater than or equal to 4; `p` is 3; `g` is `g` plus the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2.**

Explanation: The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` increments `g` by the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2. Since `h` is not defined in the initial state, we keep it as `h`. The other variables `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
