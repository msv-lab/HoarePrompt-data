You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are initialized.
   - `s` keeps track of the cumulative count of cards placed.
   - `i` keeps track of the current multiplier (starting from 1).
   - `d` and `h` are used to manage the count of remaining cards.
   - `p` and `g` are used in the loop conditions.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. This condition determines whether the k-th card belongs to the odd-numbered cards or the even-numbered cards.
   - If `k` is greater, it enters a loop to place the even-numbered cards:
     - `s` is updated by adding the count of cards that can be placed at the current multiplier (`(d + 1) // 2`).
     - `d` is reduced by the same amount.
     - `i` is incremented to move to the next multiplier.
   - After placing the even-numbered cards, it calculates the position of the k-th card among the remaining cards.
   - If `k` is not greater, it directly prints the k-th odd-numbered card (`2 * k - 1`).

### Correctness Check:

1. **Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - The logic for placing odd-numbered cards is straightforward and correct.
   - The formula `2 * k - 1` correctly generates the k-th odd-numbered card.

2. **Even-Numbered Cards:**
   - The logic for placing even-numbered cards is flawed.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `2 ** (i - 1) * f`, where `f` is the position of the card within the current multiplier group.
   - However, the placement of even-numbered cards should follow the pattern of multiples of odd numbers, which is not correctly implemented.
   - The program does not correctly handle the placement of even-numbered cards based on the problem description.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify with the provided example:

- For `n = 7` and `k = 1` to `7`:
  - The sequence should be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
  - The program outputs: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4, which is correct.

- For `n = 1` and `k = 1`:
  - The sequence is just 1.
  - The program outputs: 1, which is correct.

- For `n = 34` and `k = 14`:
  - The sequence includes 27 (2 * 13 - 1), which is correct.

- For `n = 84` and `k = 19`:
  - The sequence includes 37 (2 * 19 - 1), which is correct.

- For `n = 1000000000` and `k = 1000000000`:
  - The sequence includes 536870912 (2 * 250000000 - 1), which is correct.

### Conclusion:

Despite the correct handling of odd-numbered cards, the logic for placing even-numbered cards is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem.
