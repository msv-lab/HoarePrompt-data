Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `g`. Since `g` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
