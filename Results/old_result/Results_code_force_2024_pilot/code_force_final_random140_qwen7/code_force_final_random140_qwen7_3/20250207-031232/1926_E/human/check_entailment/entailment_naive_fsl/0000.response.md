Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process for laying down the cards. Specifically, the logic for determining the k-th card laid down is flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  7 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  7
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program will output `4` instead of `7`.

Here's why the program fails:

1. The program attempts to handle cases where `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` separately, but the logic inside this block is incorrect. It incorrectly calculates the position of the k-th card without properly accounting for the sequence of cards laid down.

2. For `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the correct sequence of cards laid down is `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`. The fourth card in this sequence is `7`, but the program outputs `4`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate the process of laying down the cards according to the rules specified. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        cards = []
        i = 1
        while len(cards) < n:
            if i % 2 != 0:
                cards.append(i)
            i += 1
        result = cards[k - 1]
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the process of laying down the cards and finds the k-th card in the sequence.
