Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the logarithm base 2 of `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to `i`.
   - `s` is equal to `i`.
   - `d` is 0.
   - `h` is `n`.
   - `p` is 1.
   - `f` is `k - g`, where `g` is 0.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop condition `p <= i - 1` involves the variables `p` and `i`.
   - Currently, `p` is 1 and `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the logarithm base 2 of `n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - Since `p` is 1, it is always less than or equal to `i - 1` if `i` is greater than 1.
   - However, we need to ensure that `i` is indeed greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Since `i` is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to the logarithm base 2 of `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0, `i` will be at least 1.
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `i` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `i` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `s` is equal to `i`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 0.**
