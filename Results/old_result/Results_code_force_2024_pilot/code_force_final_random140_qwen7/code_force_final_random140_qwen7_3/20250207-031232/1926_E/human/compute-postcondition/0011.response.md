Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is (d + 1) // 2, `d` is now d - (d + 1) // 2, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `d -= (d + 1) // 2` updates the value of `d` by subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from it. Given that `d` was initially equal to `n`, after the operation, `d` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `p`, `g`) remain unchanged.
