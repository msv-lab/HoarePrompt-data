Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` (which is `d`) is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 1, `d` is now equal to `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `d` is updated to `d - ((d + 1) // 2)`. Given that `d` is initially equal to `n`, the new value of `d` becomes `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
