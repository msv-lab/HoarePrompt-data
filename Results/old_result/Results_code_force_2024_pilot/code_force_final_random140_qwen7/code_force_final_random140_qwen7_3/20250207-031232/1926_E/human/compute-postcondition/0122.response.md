Output State: `i` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`d`), `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is 1, `h` is equal to 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is `i - 1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `d` is reduced to 1, as it is halved each time and rounded down. The variable `p` equals the total number of iterations `i`, since `p` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. The variable `g` accumulates the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, which results in `g` being equal to `i - 1`. When `d` reaches 1, the loop terminates, and `h` becomes 0 because it is set to `n - 1 - (n - 1 + 1) // 2` in the last iteration and then decreases further.
