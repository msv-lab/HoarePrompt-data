Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` and the series of terms resulting from the operation `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `p`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
