Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s < k and d > 0`.

2. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - `s < k`: This part of the condition depends on `s` and `k`.
   - `d > 0`: This part of the condition depends on `d`.

3. **Check the current state of these variables**:
   - `s` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer (we cannot change `k`).
   - `d` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an input integer.

4. **Analyze the conditions**:
   - For `s < k` to be true, `s` (which is 0) must be less than `k`. Since `s` is 0, this part of the condition will be true as long as `k` is greater than 0.
   - For `d > 0` to be true, `d` (which is equal to `n`) must be greater than 0. Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `d` (which is `n`) is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `d` (or equivalently `n`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` (which is `d`) must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**.
