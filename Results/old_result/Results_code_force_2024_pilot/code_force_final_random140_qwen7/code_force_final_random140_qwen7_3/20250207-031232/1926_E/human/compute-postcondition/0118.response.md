Output State: **`i` must be at least 4, `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n - 1 - (n - 1 + 1) // 2`, `p` is 3, `g` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `g` is incremented by `(h + 1) // 2`. Given that `h` is calculated as `n - 1 - (n - 1 + 1) // 2`, and since `n` is equal to `d`, we substitute `n` with `d` to find `h`. Simplifying `h` gives us `h = d - 1 - ((d - 1 + 1) // 2) = d - 1 - (d // 2)`. Since `d` is equal to `n`, `h` simplifies to `d - 1 - (d // 2)`. 

Then, `g += (h + 1) // 2` translates to `g += (d - 1 - (d // 2) + 1) // 2 = g + (d // 2) // 2 = g + d // 4`. Given the initial value of `g` is 2, after the operation, `g` becomes `2 + d // 4`. Since `d` is equal to `n`, `g` becomes `2 + n // 4`. However, without the exact value of `n`, we express `g` as `4` (assuming `n` is at least 4, making `n // 4` at least 1, thus `g` becomes 3 + 1 = 4). All other variables remain unchanged.
