Output State: **`i` is the total number of iterations, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` and the series of terms resulting from the operation `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `d` will be 0, as it gets halved in each iteration and eventually reaches 0. The loop continues to increment `i` and update `h` and `g` until `d` becomes 0. The final value of `h` will be 0 since it keeps decreasing by `(h + 1) // 2` in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `p` will be equal to `i` because it increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `g` accumulates the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` in the first iteration and then adds `(h + 1) // 2` for each subsequent iteration until `h` becomes 0.
