Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The loop mentioned in the initial state will still run `n` times, but no changes are made to `n` or `k` within the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `s` and retains the initial values of `n` and `k`.
