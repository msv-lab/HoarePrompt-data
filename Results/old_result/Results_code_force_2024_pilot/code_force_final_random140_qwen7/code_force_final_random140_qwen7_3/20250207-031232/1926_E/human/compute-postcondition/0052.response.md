Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `d` is equal to `n`, the expression simplifies to `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
