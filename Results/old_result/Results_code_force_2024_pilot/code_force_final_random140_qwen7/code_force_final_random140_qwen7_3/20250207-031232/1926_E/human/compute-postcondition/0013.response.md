To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `s < k` and `d > 0`.

1. **Condition `s < k`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is \((d + 1) // 2\).
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must be less than `k`.
   - Therefore, `s` must be less than `k` for the loop to execute again.

2. **Condition `d > 0`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is now \(d - (d + 1) // 2\).
   - For the loop to continue, `d` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `d` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that both `s < k` and `d > 0` hold true for the next iteration of the loop.

### Adjusted States:
- `s` must be less than `k`.
- `d` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` must be less than `k`, `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.**
