Output State: **`i` is at least 3, `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n - 1 - (n - 1 + 1) // 2`, `p` is 2, `g` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `h` is updated by subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from itself. Given that `h` is initially equal to `n - 1`, the new value of `h` becomes `n - 1 - ((n - 1) + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `n - 1 - n // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
