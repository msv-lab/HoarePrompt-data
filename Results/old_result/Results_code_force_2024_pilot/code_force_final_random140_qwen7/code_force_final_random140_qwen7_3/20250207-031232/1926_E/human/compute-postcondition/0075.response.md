Output State: **`i` must be greater than 4; `h` is equal to half of its original value; `p` must be less than `i - 2`; `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`**.

This means that `i` remains greater than 4, `h` is updated to its original value divided by 2 (using integer division), `p` remains less than `i - 2`, and `g` is increased by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`.
