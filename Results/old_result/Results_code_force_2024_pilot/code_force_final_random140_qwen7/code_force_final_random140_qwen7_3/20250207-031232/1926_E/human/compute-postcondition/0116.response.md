Output State: **`i` is at least 3, `n` is `d`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `k + n`, `d` is `n`, `h` is equal to `n - 1 - (n - 1 + 1) // 2`, `p` is 3, `g` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `p` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
