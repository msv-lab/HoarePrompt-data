Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `s` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`.**

The code assigns the value of `n` to `d`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `d` now holds the same value as `n`.
