Output State: `i` is equal to `k`, `d` is 1, `s` is `k`, `n` is an input integer which is greater than 0, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the input integer `k`. The variable `d` will always end up being 1 because it is halved each iteration until it reaches 1. The variable `s` accumulates the sum as per the loop's logic, and since the loop continues as long as `s < k` and `d > 0`, once `d` becomes 1 and `s` reaches `k`, the loop condition fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, `s` will be exactly `k`. All other variables (`n`, `h`, `p`, `g`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
