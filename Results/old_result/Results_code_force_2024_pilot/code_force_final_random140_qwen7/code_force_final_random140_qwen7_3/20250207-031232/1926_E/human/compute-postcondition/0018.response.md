Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is `d` + 1, `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code `s += (d + 1) // 2` updates the value of `s` by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `d` must be greater than 0, `(d + 1) // 2` will be a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `s` is expressed as `d` + 1 because `(d + 1) // 2` simplifies to `d` when `d` is greater than 0.
