Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` (which is `d`) is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `d` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `s` is `s + (d + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. The initial state of `d` is given as `(d + 1) // 2`, so the updated value of `s` is `s + (d + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
