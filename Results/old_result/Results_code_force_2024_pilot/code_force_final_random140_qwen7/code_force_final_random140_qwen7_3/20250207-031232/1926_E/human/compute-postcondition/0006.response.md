Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `p` to 1. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables while updating `p` to 1.
