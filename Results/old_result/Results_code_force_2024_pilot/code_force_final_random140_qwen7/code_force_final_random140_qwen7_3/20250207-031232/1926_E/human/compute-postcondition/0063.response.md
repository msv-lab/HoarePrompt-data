Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is 3, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `f` is `k - g`, `g` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. The conditions and values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `f`, and `g` remain as per the initial state.
