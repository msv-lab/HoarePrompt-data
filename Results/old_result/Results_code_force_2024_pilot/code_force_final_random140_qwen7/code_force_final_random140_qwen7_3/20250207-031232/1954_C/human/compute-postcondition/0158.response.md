Output State: **`vt` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]`, and then further concatenated with `x`, and `kq2` is a string based on the maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with the string representations of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `kq1` was initially a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]`.
- After executing `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)`, `kq1` is now further concatenated with the value of `x` (which is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i]))`.
- The values of `vt`, `i`, `kq2`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
