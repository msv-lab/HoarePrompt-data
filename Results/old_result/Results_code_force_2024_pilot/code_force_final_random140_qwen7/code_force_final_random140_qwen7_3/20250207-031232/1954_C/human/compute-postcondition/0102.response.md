Output State: **`i` is 2, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(a[0])`, `kq2` is `kq2 + str(a[2])`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`**.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `kq1` is `kq1 + str(a[0])`
- `kq2` is `kq2 + str(a[2])`
- `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`
- `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`

The code updates `x` and `y`:
- `x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`

Since `i` is 2, the code becomes:
- `x, y = min(int(a[2]), int(b[2])), max(int(a[2]), int(b[2]))`

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`
- `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`

All other variables remain unchanged.
