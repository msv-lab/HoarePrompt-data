Output State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial states of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
