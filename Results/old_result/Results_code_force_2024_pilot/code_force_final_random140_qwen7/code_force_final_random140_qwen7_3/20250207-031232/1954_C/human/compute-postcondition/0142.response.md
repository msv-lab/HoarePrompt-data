Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that contains either the string representation of the minimum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is a string that contains either the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

This output state reflects that the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` remains as `i + 1`, and `kq1` and `kq2` retain their original descriptions. However, `x` is now set to the minimum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, and `y` is set to the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`.
