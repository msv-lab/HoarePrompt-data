Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that contains the string representation of the minimum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with `x`, and `kq2` is a string that contains the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` (which is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`) to the string `kq1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `kq1` now includes the string representation of `x` appended to its current value.
