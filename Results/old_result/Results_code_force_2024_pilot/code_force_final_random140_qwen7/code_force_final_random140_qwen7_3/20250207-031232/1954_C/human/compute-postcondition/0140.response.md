Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that contains the string representation of the minimum or maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`, and `kq2` is a string that contains the string representation of the element at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` plus the element `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i]` to `kq2`. Since `kq2` originally contained the string representation of the minimum or maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`, appending `a[i]` to `kq2` changes its content to the string representation of the element at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` followed by `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
