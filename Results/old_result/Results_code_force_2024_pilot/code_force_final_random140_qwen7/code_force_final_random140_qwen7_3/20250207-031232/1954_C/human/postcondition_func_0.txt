The function processes two input strings, `a` and `b`, each representing an integer of the same length, and constructs two new strings, `kq1` and `kq2`. For each pair of corresponding characters from `a` and `b`, if the characters are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` are updated with that character. If the characters differ, `kq1` is updated with the smaller digit, and `kq2` is updated with the larger digit. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` after processing all characters.
