Output State: **`i` is 2, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(a[0]) + str(y)`, `kq2` is `kq2 + str(x) + str(a[2])`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`**.

Explanation: The code updates `kq2` by appending the string representation of `x` to its current value. Since `x` is defined as the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `i` is 2, `x` remains the same as it was before the code execution. Similarly, `y` remains unchanged as it is defined as the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. All other variables (`i`, `kq1`, `kq2`) retain their previous values except for `kq2`, which now includes the additional string representation of `x`.
