Output State: **`kq1` is `kq1 + a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `kq2` by adding the value of `a[i]` to its current value. Since `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `kq2` is effectively updated to `kq2 + b[i]`. The value of `kq1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, both `kq1` and `kq2` are updated to include the value of `a[i]` (or equivalently `b[i]`).
