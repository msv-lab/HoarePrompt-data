Output State: **`i` is 1, `kq2` is `kq2 + str(int(a[0]))`, `kq1` is `a[0] + a[i]` if `i` was 0, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` if `i` was 1, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 1.
- Since `i` is 1, the condition `if i was 0` does not apply to `kq1`.
- `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`. Here, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, which simplifies to `x` being the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])` because `i` is 1.
- `kq1` remains unchanged as the condition `if i was 0` does not apply.
- `x` and `y` remain as defined in the initial state, being the minimum and maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, which simplifies to `x` being the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, and `y` being the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`.
- `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` if `i` was 1, but since `i` is 1, this condition does not apply, so `kq1` remains as `a[0] + a[i]` if `i` was 0.
- `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`.
