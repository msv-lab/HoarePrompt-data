Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the value of `vt`.
     - If `vt` is 0, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)`, and `kq1` remains unchanged.
     - If `vt` is 1, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)` if `i` was 1, otherwise `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(int(a[0]))`. `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` if `i` was 1, otherwise `kq1` is updated to `a[0] + a[i]`.
   - `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
   - `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(a))`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to update the state of `i` to `2`.
   - We need to determine the new values of `x` and `y` based on `a[2]` and `b[2]`.
   - We need to consider the possible updates to `kq1` and `kq2` based on the value of `vt` and the condition `i == 1`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `i` will be updated to `2`.
- `x` will be the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`.
- `y` will be the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`.

The exact values of `kq1` and `kq2` depend on the value of `vt` and the condition `i == 1`. Since `i` is now `2`, the condition `i == 1` is false, so the updates to `kq1` and `kq2` will be based on `a[0]` and `a[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(a[0])`, `kq2` is `kq2 + str(a[2])`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`**.
