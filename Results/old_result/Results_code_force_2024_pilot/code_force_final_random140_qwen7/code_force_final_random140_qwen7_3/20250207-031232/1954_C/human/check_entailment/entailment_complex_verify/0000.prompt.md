You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, indicating that all characters in `a` and `b` have been processed. `kq1` is a string constructed by taking the minimum of corresponding characters from `a` and `b` when `vt` was 0 at the end of the loop, and the maximum otherwise. Conversely, `kq2` is constructed by taking the maximum when `vt` was 0 and the minimum otherwise. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` will thus be composed of characters derived from comparing each pair of characters from `a` and `b` throughout the entire loop execution, following the rules specified within the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two input strings, `a` and `b`, each representing an integer of the same length, and constructs two new strings, `kq1` and `kq2`. For each pair of corresponding characters from `a` and `b`, if the characters are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` are updated with that character. If the characters differ, `kq1` is updated with the smaller digit, and `kq2` is updated with the larger digit. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` after processing all characters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their digits. The logic in the program only swaps the minimum and maximum digits at each position but does not consider the overall impact on the product. For instance, consider the input:

```
3
19
91
```

The program will output:

```
11
99
```

However, the optimal solution would be:

```
91
91
```

This results in a higher product (8281 compared to 181). Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and fails to maximize the product of `x` and `y`.
