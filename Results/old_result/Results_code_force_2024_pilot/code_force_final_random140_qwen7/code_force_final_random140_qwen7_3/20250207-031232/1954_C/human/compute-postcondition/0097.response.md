Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the value of `vt`. If `vt` is 0, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)` and `kq1` remains unchanged. If `vt` is 1, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)` if `i` was 1, otherwise `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(int(a[0]))`. `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` if `i` was 1, otherwise `kq1` is updated to `a[0] + a[i]`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**
