Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `i` is set to 1, `kq1` is equal to the character at index 0 of `a`, and `kq2` is equal to `kq2 + a[1]`. Otherwise, `i` is set to 0, `a[0]` is not equal to `b[0]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. If `vt` is 1, then `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y` as a string appended to it, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `x` as a string appended to it.
