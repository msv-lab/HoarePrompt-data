Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing `str(y)` appended to it, `kq2` is an empty string concatenated with `str(x)`.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` concatenates the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. Since `kq2` was initially an empty string, after executing the code, `kq2` will contain `str(x)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
