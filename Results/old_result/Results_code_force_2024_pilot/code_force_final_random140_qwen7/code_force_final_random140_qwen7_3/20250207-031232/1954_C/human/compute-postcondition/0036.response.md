Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing `str(y)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq1`. Since `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` now contains this value as a string. All other variables remain unchanged.
