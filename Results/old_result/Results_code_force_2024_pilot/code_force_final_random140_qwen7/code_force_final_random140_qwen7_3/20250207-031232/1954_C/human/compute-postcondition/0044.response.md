Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the character at index 2 of string `a`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with the character at index 2 of string `a`.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]` concatenates the character at index `i` (which is 2) of string `a` to `kq2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `kq1` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `kq1` is still `kq1` concatenated with the character at index 2 of string `a`.
