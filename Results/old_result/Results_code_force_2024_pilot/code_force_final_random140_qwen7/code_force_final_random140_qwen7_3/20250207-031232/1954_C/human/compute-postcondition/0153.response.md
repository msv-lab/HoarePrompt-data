Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]` and then further concatenated with `a[i]` again, and `kq2` is a string based on the maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with the string representations of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` appends the value of `a[i]` to the existing string `kq1`. Since `kq1` was initially based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]`, now it is further concatenated with `a[i]` again. The values of `b`, `i`, `kq2`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
