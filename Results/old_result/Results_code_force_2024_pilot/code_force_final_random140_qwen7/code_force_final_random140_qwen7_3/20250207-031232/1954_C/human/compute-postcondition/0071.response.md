Output State: **`i` is 1, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[0]`, and `kq1` is equal to `a[0] + a[i]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `i`, `kq2`, and `kq1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
