Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that now contains the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the string representation of the maximum (`y`), `kq2` is a string that now contains the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` (which is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`) to the end of the string stored in `kq2`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, and `y` remain unchanged.
