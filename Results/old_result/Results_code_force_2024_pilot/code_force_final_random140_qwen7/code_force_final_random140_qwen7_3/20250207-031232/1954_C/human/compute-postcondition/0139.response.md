Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that contains the string representation of the minimum or maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`, and `kq2` is a string that contains either the string representation of the maximum or minimum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, depending on the value of `vt`.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` concatenates the string `a[i]` (which is the string representation of the element at index `i` in list `a`) to the existing string `kq1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `kq1` now includes the element `a[i]` appended to its current value.
