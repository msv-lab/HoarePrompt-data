Output State: **`i` is 1, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[0]`, and `kq1` is equal to `a[0] + a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]` updates the value of `kq2` by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 1 and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the value of `a[i]` is `b[1]`. However, since the exact value of `b[1]` is not provided, we express `kq2` as `kq2 + a[0]` (since `a[i]` is `a[1]` and `i` is 1). The value of `kq1` remains unchanged as it was defined as `a[0] + a[i]` and `i` is still 1.
