Output State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `b = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. Since the input function returns a string, `b` will be a string. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
