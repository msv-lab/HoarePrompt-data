Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is the input string, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[len(a)-1])` and `int(b[len(a)-1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[len(a)-1])` and `int(b[len(a)-1])`, and `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists. `kq1` is a string that contains either the string representation of the minimum or maximum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is a string that contains either the string representation of the maximum or minimum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, depending on the value of `vt`. If the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated accordingly, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that contains either the string representation of the minimum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`, or the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the element `a[i]`, and `kq2` is a string that contains either the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, or the string representation of the maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]` and further concatenated with either `a[i]` or another string based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. `kq2` is a string based on the maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with the string representations of `x` (minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`) and `y` (maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`). Depending on the condition, `kq2` is either updated by appending `a[i]` or a string representation of `x` or `y` to its current value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
