Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All characters from string `a` are appended to `kq1` and `kq2` alternately.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is a string constructed based on the comparison of each character in `a` and `b` as described in the loop, and `kq2` is another string constructed similarly but with a different order of concatenation based on the value of `vt`. The variable `x` is the minimum of `int(a[len(a)-1])` and `int(b[len(a)-1])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[len(a)-1])` and `int(b[len(a)-1])`.

To break it down further:
- `kq1` and `kq2` will contain strings formed by iterating through each character of `a` and `b`.
- If characters at the same index in `a` and `b` are the same, those characters are added directly to both `kq1` and `kq2`.
- If characters differ, the smaller and larger integers (converted from characters) are added to `kq1` and `kq2` in alternating order, starting with the smaller one when `vt` is 0, and vice versa when `vt` is 1.
- After all iterations, `kq1` and `kq2` will reflect the final state of the strings constructed during the loop execution, and `i` will be the last index processed, which is `len(a) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `i` is equal to `len(a)` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the minimum or maximum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` throughout the loop, and `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of the maximum or minimum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` throughout the loop, depending on the comparison results and the initial value of `vt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
