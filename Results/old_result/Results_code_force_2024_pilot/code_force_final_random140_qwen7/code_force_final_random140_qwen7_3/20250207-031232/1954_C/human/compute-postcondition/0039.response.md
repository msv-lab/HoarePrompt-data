Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` appended to it, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to it. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string containing `str(y)` appended to it, and `kq2` is an empty string concatenated with `str(x)`.
