Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string based on the minimum or maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with `a[i]`, and then appended with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is a string based on the maximum of elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, concatenated with the string representations of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code appends `str(y)` to the existing value of `kq1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq2`, and the expressions for `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states.
