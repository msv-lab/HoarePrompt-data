Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the character at index 2 of string `a`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with the character at index 2 of string `a`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial conditions.
