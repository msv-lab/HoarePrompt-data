Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of the length of list `a`. Therefore, `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists.
   - `kq1` is a string that contains either the string representation of the minimum or maximum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`.
   - `kq2` is a string that contains either the string representation of the maximum or minimum of the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b`, depending on the value of `vt`.
   - If the elements at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated accordingly, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is based on the index `i`, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `kq1` and `kq2` will depend on the comparison of the elements at the new index `i+1` of `a` and `b`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `kq1` and `kq2` will be updated based on the elements at the new index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of both lists and equals `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that contains either the string representation of the minimum or maximum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is a string that contains either the string representation of the maximum or minimum of the elements at index `i + 1` of `a` and `b`, depending on the value of `vt`.**
