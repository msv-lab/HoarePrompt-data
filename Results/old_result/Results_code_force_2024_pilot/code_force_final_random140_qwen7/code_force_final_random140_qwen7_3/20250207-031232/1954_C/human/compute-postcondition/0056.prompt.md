Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vt` is 0, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input integer, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `i` is 1, then `kq1` is equal to the character at index 0 of `a`, `kq2` is equal to `kq2 + a[1]`, `i` is 1, and `a` is a non-empty string. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `i` is 0, then `a[0]` is not equal to `b[0]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` if `vt` is 1, otherwise `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to it, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `x` appended to it if `vt` is 1, otherwise `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, and based on the condition `a[i] == b[i]`, either `kq1` is the string `a[1]`, `kq2` is the string `a[1] + a[1]`, and the loop continues, or `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` appended to it, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to it if `vt` is 0, otherwise `kq1` is a string containing `str(y)` appended to it, and `kq2` is an empty string concatenated with `str(x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, and the following conditions hold:
- If the character at index 2 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 2 of string `b`, then `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the character at index 2 of string `a`, and `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with the character at index 2 of string `a`.
- Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and if `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` as a string appended to its current value, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` as a string appended to its current value. Otherwise, `kq1` is an empty string concatenated with `str(y)`, resulting in `str(y)`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `str(x)` appended to its end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
