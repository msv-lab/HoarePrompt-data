Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is a string; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `kq1` is a string containing the value of `str(y)` appended to its end.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the end of `kq1`. Since `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `kq1` now contains the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
