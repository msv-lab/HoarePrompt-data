Output State: **`q` is `t`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string**.

The code `kq2 = ''` assigns an empty string to `kq2`. Since `kq1` was already an empty string, its state remains unchanged. The values of `q`, `a`, and `b` are also unaffected by this assignment.
