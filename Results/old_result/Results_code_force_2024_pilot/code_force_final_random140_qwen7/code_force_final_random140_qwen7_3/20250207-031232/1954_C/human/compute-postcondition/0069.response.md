Output State: **`i` is 1, `kq1` is equal to `a[0] + a[i]`, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` increments the index `i` from 0 to 1 (since `i` was initially 0), and adds the value of `a[i]` (which is equal to `b[i]`) to `kq1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
