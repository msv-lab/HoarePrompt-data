Output State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input integer, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string.**

The code `kq2 = ''` assigns an empty string to `kq2`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `kq1` remain unchanged.
