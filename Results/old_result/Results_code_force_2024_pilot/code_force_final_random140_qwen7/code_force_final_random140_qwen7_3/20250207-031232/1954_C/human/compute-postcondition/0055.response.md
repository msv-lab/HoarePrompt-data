Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, and the following conditions hold:
- If the character at index 2 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 2 of string `b`, then `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the character at index 2 of string `a`, and `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with the character at index 2 of string `a`.
- Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and if `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` as a string appended to its current value, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` as a string appended to its current value. Otherwise, `kq1` is an empty string concatenated with `str(y)`, resulting in `str(y)`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `str(x)` appended to its end.
