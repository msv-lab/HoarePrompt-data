Output State: **`i` is 2, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(a[0]) + str(y)`, `kq2` is `kq2 + str(a[2])`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`**.

Explanation: The code updates `kq1` by appending the string representation of `y` to its current value. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the expressions for `x` and `y` also remain unchanged. The updated value of `kq1` includes the original value of `kq1` plus `str(a[0])` plus `str(y)`.
