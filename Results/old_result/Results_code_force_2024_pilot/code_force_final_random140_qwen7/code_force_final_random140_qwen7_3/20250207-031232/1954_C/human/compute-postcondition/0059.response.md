Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- All characters from string `a` are appended to `kq1` and `kq2` alternately.

### Loop Statement
```
for q in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `q`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `q < t`.

### Current State
- Since the loop is iterating over `range(t)`, `q` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- After the previous iteration, `q` is equal to `t-1` (because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`).

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be less than `t`.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `q` should be set to `t`.

### Updated State
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `q`.
- `q` should be set to `t`.

### Final Answer
State: **`q` is `t`**
