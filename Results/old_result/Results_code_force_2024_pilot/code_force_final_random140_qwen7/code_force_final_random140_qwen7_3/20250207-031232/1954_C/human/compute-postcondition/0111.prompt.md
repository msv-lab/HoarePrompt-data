Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is `t`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is 1, then `kq2` is `kq2 + a[0]`, `kq1` is `a[0] + a[i]`, and `x` and `y` are not modified. If `i` is 0, then `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `kq1` and `kq2` are updated according to the value of `vt`: if `vt` is 1, then `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y`; otherwise, `kq1` is the string `y` concatenated with itself, and `kq2` is the string `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the value of `vt`. If `vt` is 0, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)` and `kq1` remains unchanged. If `vt` is 1, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)` if `i` was 1, otherwise `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(int(a[0]))`. `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` if `i` was 1, otherwise `kq1` is updated to `a[0] + a[i]`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `kq1` is updated based on the value of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(a[0] + a[2]) + str(a[2]) + a[2]`. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to either `kq1 + str(int(a[0])) + str(x) + str(y) + str(a[2])` or `kq1 + str(a[0]) + str(y) + str(x) + str(a[2])` depending on the value of `vt`. `kq2` is updated to either `kq2 + str(y) + str(a[2])` or `kq2 + str(x) + str(a[2])` depending on the value of `vt`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
