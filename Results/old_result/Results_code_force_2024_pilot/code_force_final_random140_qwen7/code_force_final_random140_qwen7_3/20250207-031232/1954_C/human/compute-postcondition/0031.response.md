Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `kq1` is the string `a[1]`, `kq2` is the string `a[1] + a[1]` and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the fact that the loop continues.
