The code assigns the value of `n // 2` to `median_index`. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `median_index` is now `n // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i] < median`.
