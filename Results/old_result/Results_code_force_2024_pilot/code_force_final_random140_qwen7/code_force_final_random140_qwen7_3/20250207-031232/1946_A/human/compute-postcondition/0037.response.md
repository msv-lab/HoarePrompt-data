Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, the value of `a[i]` is updated to be less than the median, and `operations` is increased by the difference between `median` and the original value of `a[i]`, `operations` is now `operations + (median - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `operations` variable by adding the difference between `median` and the current value of `a[i]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
