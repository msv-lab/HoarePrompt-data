Output State: **`i` equals `n`, `n` is an input integer, all elements in the list `a` are sorted integers and are less than or equal to `median`, and `t` must be greater than 1; `median` is `a[n // 2]; median_index` is `n // 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[median_index]` to the variable `median`. Since `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is set to the element at index `n // 2` in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
