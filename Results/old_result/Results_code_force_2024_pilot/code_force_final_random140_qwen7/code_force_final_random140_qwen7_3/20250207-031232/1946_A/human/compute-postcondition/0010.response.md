Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of `a[p]` in the sublist `a[p:]`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user and converts it to an integer type, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
