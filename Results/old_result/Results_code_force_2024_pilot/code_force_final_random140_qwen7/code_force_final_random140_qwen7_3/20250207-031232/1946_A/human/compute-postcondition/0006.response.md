Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`**

The code calculates `p` as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. Since `n` is an input integer, `p` will be an integer resulting from the calculation. The conditions and values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
