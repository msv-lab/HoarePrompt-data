Output State: **`i` equals `n`, and `n` is an input integer, and all elements in the list `a` are less than or equal to `median`, and `t` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `median`, `t`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
