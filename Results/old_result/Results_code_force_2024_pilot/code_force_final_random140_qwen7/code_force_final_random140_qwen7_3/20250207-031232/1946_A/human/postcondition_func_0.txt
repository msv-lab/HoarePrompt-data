The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements in the array and the array itself, sorts the array in ascending order, calculates the index of the middle element (or the element just before the middle if the array length is even), counts the occurrences of the middle element in the second half of the sorted array, and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but ensures that for each test case, the count of the specified element is printed.
