Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current implementation counts how many elements from the middle position `p` onwards are equal to `a[p]`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement. Instead, it should compare the median of the original array with the potential new median after increasing the appropriate element(s). Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

1. Identify the median position `p` in the sorted array.
2. Determine the current median value.
3. Calculate the difference between the current median and the next possible higher value.
4. Count the number of operations needed to make the smallest element at or above this new median value.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median = a[p]
        # If n is odd, consider the next element as well
        if n % 2 == 0:
            median = (median + a[p + 1]) / 2
        
        # Find the minimum number of operations needed
        min_operations = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] <= median:
                min_operations += median - a[i]
        
        print(min_operations)

func()
```

This corrected function properly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
