Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and calculates the median. Then, it computes the total difference between the median and each element in the list `a` that is less than the median. Finally, it prints the total difference for each test case.**
