Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i] < median`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`, and `operations` are updated according to the new sorted list `a`.
