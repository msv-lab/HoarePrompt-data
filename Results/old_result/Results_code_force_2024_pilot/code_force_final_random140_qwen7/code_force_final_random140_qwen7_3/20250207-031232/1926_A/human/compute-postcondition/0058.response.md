Postcondition: **`i` remains `length_of_a + 1`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A', `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A', `t` remains greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is the original input string, and `j` is the last character of `a`. The condition `l < h` holds true.**
