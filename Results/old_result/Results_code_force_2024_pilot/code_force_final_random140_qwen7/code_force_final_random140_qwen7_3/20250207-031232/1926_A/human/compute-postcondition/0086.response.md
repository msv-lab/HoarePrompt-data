Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_a + 2`, `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is an input string, `j` is the last character of `a`. If any character `j` in `a` is in 'A', then `l` is the count of such characters. Otherwise, `h` is the count of characters not in 'A'. The condition `l > h` holds true.
