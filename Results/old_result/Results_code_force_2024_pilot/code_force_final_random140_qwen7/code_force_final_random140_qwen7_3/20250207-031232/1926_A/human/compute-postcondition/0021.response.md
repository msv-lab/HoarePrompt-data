Output State: **`countA` is either 2 or 0, `countB` is either 0, 1, or 2 (depending on the value of the next `letter`), and `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', and we continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `countA`, `countB`, and `userString` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or statement it was inside.
