Postcondition: `countA` is either 2 or 0, `countB` is either 0, 1, or 2 (depending on the value of the next `letter`), and `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. If `letter` is 'A', `countA` is incremented by 1. If `letter` is 'B', `countB` is incremented by 1.
