Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive; `l` is 0; `h` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a = str(input())
    for j in a:
        if j in 'A':
            l += 1
        else:
            h += 1
    if l > h:
        print('A')
    elif l < h:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of the string `a`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A', and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A'. If the count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A' (`l`) is greater than the count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A' (`h`), then `l` remains greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` remains `length_of_a + 1`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A', `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A', `t` remains greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is the original input string, and `j` is the last character of `a`. Regardless of the condition, `l` will be the exact count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A', and `h` will be the exact count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_a + 2`, `t` is greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is an input string, `j` is the last character of `a`. If the count of characters in `a` that are in 'A' (`l`) is greater than the count of characters not in 'A' (`h`), then `l` is the count of such characters. Otherwise, `h` is the count of characters not in 'A'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
