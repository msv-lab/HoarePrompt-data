Output State: **`countA` is 0, `countB` is 1, `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', and the letter `letter` is 'B'.**

Explanation: The code `countB += 1` increments the value of `countB` by 1. Since `countB` was initially 0, after executing this line, `countB` becomes 1. The values of `countA`, `userString`, and `letter` remain unchanged.
