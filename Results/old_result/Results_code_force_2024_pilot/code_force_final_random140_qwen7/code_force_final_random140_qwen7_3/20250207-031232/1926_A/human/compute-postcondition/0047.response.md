Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_a + 1`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A' plus or minus 1 (depending on whether the second character `j` is in 'A' or not), `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A' plus 1 (depending on whether the second character `j` is in 'A' or not), `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the second character of `a`.
