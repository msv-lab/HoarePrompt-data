### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program uses a predefined list `userStrings` instead of reading from standard input. This is a significant deviation from the problem statement, which specifies that the input should be read from standard input. While the program works for the provided test cases, it does not meet the problem requirements.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with elements from the `userStrings` list, which is correct for the provided data. However, this does not address the issue of input handling from standard input.

3. **Counting Characters**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. This part of the assessment is accurate.

4. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**:
   - The function correctly determines which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently by comparing the counts. The `else: pass` block ensures that if the counts are equal, no output is produced, which aligns with the problem statement.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result directly, matching the problem statement's requirement.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The logic within the function `func_1` is correct for the given test cases and meets the problem requirements regarding counting and determining the most frequent character.

However, the original assessment overlooks the critical aspect that the program should read input from standard input rather than using a predefined list. Since the problem statement explicitly requires reading from standard input, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program is logically correct for the provided test cases, but it fails to meet the problem statement's requirement of reading input from standard input.
