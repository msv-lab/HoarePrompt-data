Postcondition: `countA` is either 2 or 0, `countB` is either 0, 1, or 0 (depending on whether `letter` is 'B' or not), and `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. If `letter` is 'A', `countA` is set to 2 and `countB` remains unchanged. If `letter` is 'B', `countB` is incremented by 1 and `countA` remains unchanged.
