Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `length_of_a + 1`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A', `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A', and `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`; `a` is the input string from user.
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j in 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_a + 1`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A' plus or minus 1 (depending on whether the first character `j` is in 'A' or not), `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A' plus or minus 1 (depending on whether the first character `j` is in 'A' or not), `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the first character of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_a + 1`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A' plus or minus 1 (depending on whether the second character `j` is in 'A' or not), `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A' plus 1 (depending on whether the second character `j` is in 'A' or not), `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the second character of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_a + 1`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A' plus 1, `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A' plus 1, `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in `a`. If `j` is in 'A', `l` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
