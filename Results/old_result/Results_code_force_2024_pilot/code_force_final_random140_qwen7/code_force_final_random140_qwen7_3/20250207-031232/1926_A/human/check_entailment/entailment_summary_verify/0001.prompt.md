You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings:
    func_1(userString)

def func_1(userString):
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
    if countA > countB:
        print('A')
    elif countB > countA:
        print('B')
    else:
        pass



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `userString` of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. Based on the counts, it prints either 'A' or 'B' and returns nothing. If the string contains any characters other than 'A' and 'B', it prints nothing and returns nothing. The final state of the program ensures that `countA` and `countB` are both between 0 and 5, and their sum is always 5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, but it does not correctly read from standard input. Instead, it uses a predefined list `userStrings` which contains the test cases. This is fine for the provided example, but it doesn't match the problem statement where the input is expected to be read from standard input.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with elements from the `userStrings` list. This part is correct as far as the provided data is concerned.

3. **Counting Characters**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. It iterates through each character in the string and increments the respective counter.

4. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**: The function correctly determines which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently by comparing the counts. If both counts are equal, it prints nothing (due to the `else: pass` block), which is not specified in the problem statement.

5. **Output**: The function prints the result directly, which matches the problem statement's requirement.

### Conclusion:

- The program logic is correct for the given test cases.
- However, the program does not conform to the problem statement's requirement of reading input from standard input. But since the problem statement specifies that there are distinct test cases and the solution works for the provided test cases, we can consider the logic correct for those specific cases.

Given the problem constraints and the provided test cases, the program logic is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
