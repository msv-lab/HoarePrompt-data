Output State: **`i` is `length_of_a + 2`, `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is an input string, `j` is the first character of `a`, and `l` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
