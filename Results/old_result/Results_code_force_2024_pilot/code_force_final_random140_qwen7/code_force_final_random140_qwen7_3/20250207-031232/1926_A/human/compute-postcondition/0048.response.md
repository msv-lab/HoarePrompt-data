Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `length_of_a + 1`
   - `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A' plus or minus 1 (depending on whether the second character `j` is in 'A' or not)
   - `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A' plus 1 (depending on whether the second character `j` is in 'A' or not)
   - `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`
   - `a` is a non-empty string
   - `j` is the second character of `a`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in a:`
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be the next character in the string `a`.
   - Since `j` is the second character of `a` at the end of the previous iteration, the next character in `a` should be assigned to `j`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` and `h` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `t` must still be greater than `length_of_a + 1`.
   - `a` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is updated to the next character in `a`.

5. **New State:**
   - `i` is `length_of_a + 1`
   - `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A' plus or minus 1 (depending on whether the new `j` is in 'A' or not)
   - `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A' plus 1 (depending on whether the new `j` is in 'A' or not)
   - `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`
   - `a` is a non-empty string
   - `j` is the next character in `a`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `length_of_a + 1`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in the string 'A' plus or minus 1 (depending on whether the new `j` is in 'A' or not), `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in the string 'A' plus 1 (depending on whether the new `j` is in 'A' or not), `t` must be greater than `length_of_a + 1`, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in `a`**
