Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly determine whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Let's analyze why:

1. **Condition `n < m`:**
   - This condition checks if the number of moves (`n`) is less than the desired number of cubes (`m`). If `n < m`, it prints 'NO'. However, this is incorrect because it is possible to have more moves than cubes, as long as the difference between `n` and `m` is even (since each pair of moves can net zero cubes).

2. **Condition `n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0)`**:
   - This condition checks if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even. While this condition is true when the parity (odd/even nature) matches, it does not cover all cases where it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move (putting or removing a cube) changes the count by 1, which means the parity of the difference must be even.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
- Calculate the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- Check if this difference is even.
- Print 'YES' if the difference is even, indicating it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.
