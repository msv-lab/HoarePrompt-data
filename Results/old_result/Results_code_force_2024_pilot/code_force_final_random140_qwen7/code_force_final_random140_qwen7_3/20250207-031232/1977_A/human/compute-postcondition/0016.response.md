Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, converted to an integer.
- `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, converted to an integer.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Output: **YES**
