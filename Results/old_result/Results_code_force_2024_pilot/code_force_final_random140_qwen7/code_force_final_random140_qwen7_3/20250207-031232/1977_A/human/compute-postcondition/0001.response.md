Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\); `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user; `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The input values for `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
