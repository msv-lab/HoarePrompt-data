You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is less than `m`; if true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even; if true, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the specified conditions for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem asks whether it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Moves can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - The final number of cubes `m` should be achievable within `n` moves.

2. **Initial Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over the number of test cases using `for _ in range(int(input()))`.
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - The condition `if n < m` checks if `n` is less than `m`. If true, it prints 'NO', which is incorrect because `n` can be greater than `m` and still achieve `m` cubes.
   - The condition `elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0)` checks if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even. This logic is not entirely correct for determining if `m` can be achieved from `n`.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - To determine if `m` can be achieved from `n` moves, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (add 1, remove 1) results in no net change in the number of cubes.
   - Therefore, the correct condition should be `if (n - m) % 2 == 0`.

4. **Revised Code**:
   ```python
   def func():
       for _ in range(int(input())):
           (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
           if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
               print('YES')
           else:
               print('NO')
   ```

### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if `m` cubes can be achieved after `n` moves. The revised logic should check if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
