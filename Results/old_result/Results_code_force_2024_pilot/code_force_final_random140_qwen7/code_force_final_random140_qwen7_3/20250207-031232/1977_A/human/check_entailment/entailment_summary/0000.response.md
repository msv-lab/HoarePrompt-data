Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking two conditions:
1. If `n` is less than `m`, it directly prints 'NO'.
2. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it checks whether `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, and prints 'YES' if this condition is met.

However, there is a flaw in the logic for determining if the tower can have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key point is that the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m` alone is not sufficient to determine the possibility. Instead, the difference between `n` and `m` should be considered. Specifically, since each move adds or removes exactly one cube, the difference between `n` and `m` must be zero for it to be possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's correct the logic:
- If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, so print 'NO'.
- If `n == m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, so print 'YES'.
- If `n > m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, so print 'YES'.

Given the current logic, the program incorrectly handles cases where `n` is greater than `m` and both `n` and `m` are odd or even. This is because the difference between `n` and `m` is not being checked properly.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n == m:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

Based on the above reasoning:

Correctness: **False**
