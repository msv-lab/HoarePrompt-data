Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer, and `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer. If both `n` and `m` are odd, or both are even, then the program continues with these values of `n` and `m`. Otherwise, the program does not change the values of `n` and `m`.
