The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is less than `m`; if true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even; if true, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the specified conditions for each test case.
