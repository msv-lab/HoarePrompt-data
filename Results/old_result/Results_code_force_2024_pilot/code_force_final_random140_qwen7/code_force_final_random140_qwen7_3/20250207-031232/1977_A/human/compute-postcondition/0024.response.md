Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer. If both `n` and `m` are odd, or if both `n` and `m` are even, then the program continues with these values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.
