Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and splits them based on whitespace. These integers are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigned to `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
