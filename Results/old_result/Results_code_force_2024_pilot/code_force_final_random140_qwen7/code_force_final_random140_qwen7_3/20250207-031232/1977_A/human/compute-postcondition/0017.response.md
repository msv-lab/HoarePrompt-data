Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user converted to an integer, and if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. If the condition `n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0)` is true, the program does not change the values of `n` and `m`.**
