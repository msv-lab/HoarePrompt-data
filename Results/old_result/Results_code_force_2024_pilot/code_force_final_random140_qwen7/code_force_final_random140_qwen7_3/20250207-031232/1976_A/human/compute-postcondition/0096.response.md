Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character; `ch` is the next character in `password`; if `ch` is an alphabet, then `letters` now includes the character `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is the concatenation of `digits` and `ch`. If `ch` is neither, then `digits` remains unchanged.
