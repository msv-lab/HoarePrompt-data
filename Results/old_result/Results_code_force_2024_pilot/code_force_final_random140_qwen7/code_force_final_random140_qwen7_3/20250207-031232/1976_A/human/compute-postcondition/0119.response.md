Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of strings representing passwords. Each password consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has a length between 1 and 20. It processes each password to check if the letters and digits are in sorted order and if the last letter comes before the first digit in the password. If all passwords fail these checks, it returns a list with 'NO' repeated for the number of passwords. Otherwise, it returns a list with 'NO' followed by 'YES' if at least one password passes the checks.**
