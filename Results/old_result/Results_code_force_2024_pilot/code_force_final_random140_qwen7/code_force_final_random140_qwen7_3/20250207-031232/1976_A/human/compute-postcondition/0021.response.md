Output State: **`ch` is the next character from the `password` string; `letters` is a string containing the original alphabetic characters plus the character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise it is an empty string; `digits` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `letters`. The value of `ch` is the next character from the `password` string. The value of `digits` remains unchanged because no operation affects it. The value of `letters` is updated to include the character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise, it remains the same as before.
