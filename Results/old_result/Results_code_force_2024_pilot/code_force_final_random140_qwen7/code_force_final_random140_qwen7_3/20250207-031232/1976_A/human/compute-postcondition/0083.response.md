Output State: **`password` must contain at least one character, and `letters` is equal to `ch`.**

Explanation: The variable `letters` is assigned the value of `ch`, which is an alphabetic character. The precondition that `password` must contain at least one character remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `letters` now holds the value of `ch`, and `password` still contains at least one character.
