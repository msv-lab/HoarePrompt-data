Output State: **`ch` is the next character from the `password` string, `letters` is a string containing the original alphabetic characters plus the character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise it is an empty string; `digits` is a string containing the digit `ch` appended to itself if `ch` is a digit, and remains unchanged otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `digits += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `digits`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` will now contain the digit `ch` appended to itself. The other variables (`ch`, `letters`) remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.
