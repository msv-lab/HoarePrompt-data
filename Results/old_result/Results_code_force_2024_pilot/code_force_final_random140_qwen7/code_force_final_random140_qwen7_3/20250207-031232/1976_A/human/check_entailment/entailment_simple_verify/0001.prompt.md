You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input('Number of test cases, t = '))
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input('Length of password, n: '))
    password = input('enter passowrd: ').strip()
    test_cases.append((n, password))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        digits = ''
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if letters and digits and (password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
    return results

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of strings where each string represents a password consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with each password's length ranging from 1 to 20.

    return results
    #The program returns the string 'results' which contains either 'NO' repeated as many times as there are elements in 'test_cases', or 'NO' followed by 'YES' if any password meets the conditions to be labeled as 'YES'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it separates the password into letters and digits.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
   - It then checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter.
     - If such a digit exists, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
     - Otherwise, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - This logic aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits correctly.
   - It ensures that all letters come before any digits and that both letters and digits are sorted.

### Verification:

- **Testcase 1**: `12ac`
  - Letters: `a, c` (sorted)
  - Digits: `1, 2` (sorted)
  - No digit after a letter
  - Result: `YES`

- **Testcase 2**: `123wa`
  - Letters: `w, a` (not sorted)
  - Result: `NO`

- **Testcase 3**: `allllmost`
  - Letters: `a, l, l, l, l, o, s, t` (sorted)
  - Digits: None
  - No digit after a letter
  - Result: `YES`

- **Testcase 4**: `ac123`
  - Letters: `a, c` (sorted)
  - Digits: `1, 2, 3` (sorted)
  - Digit `1` after letter `c`
  - Result: `NO`

- **Testcase 5**: `011679`
  - Letters: None
  - Digits: `0, 1, 1, 6, 7, 9` (sorted)
  - No digit after a letter
  - Result: `YES`

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to verify whether a password meets the specified conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
