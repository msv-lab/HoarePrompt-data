Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` contains 'NO', `n` is the next value from the `test_cases` list, `password` is the corresponding string from the `test_cases` list, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, then `letters` is set to `ch`. Otherwise, if `ch` is a non-alphabetic character, `password` will still contain at least one non-alphabetic character and `digits` is incremented by 1 if `ch` is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character (one character more than before if the condition is met, or one character less than before if the condition is not met), `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged. If `ch` is alphabetic, `letters` is updated to include `ch`; otherwise, `ch` is added to `digits`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `password` contains at least one additional character compared to the precondition, `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged. If the added character is alphabetic (`ch.isalpha()` returns True), then `letters` is increased by `ch`; otherwise, `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
