Postcondition: `results` contains 'NO', indicating that either the `letters` variable is not sorted compared to its original state or the `digits` variable is not sorted compared to its original state. If the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`, `results` will contain two 'NO' entries. Otherwise, `results` will contain 'NO' and 'YES'.
