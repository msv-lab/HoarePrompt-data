Output State: **`password` must contain at least one character; `digits` is the concatenation of `digits` and `ch`.**

Explanation: The variable `digits` is assigned the value of `ch`, which means `digits` is updated to be the concatenation of its current value (if any) and the character `ch`. The precondition that `password` must contain at least one character remains unchanged, and the value of `ch` as the next character in `password` also remains valid.
