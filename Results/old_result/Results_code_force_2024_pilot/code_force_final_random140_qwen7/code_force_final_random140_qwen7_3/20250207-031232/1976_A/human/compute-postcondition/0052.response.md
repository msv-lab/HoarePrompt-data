Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, then `letters` is set to `ch`. Otherwise, if `ch` is a non-alphabetic character, `password` will still contain at least one non-alphabetic character and `digits` is incremented by 1 if `ch` is a digit.
