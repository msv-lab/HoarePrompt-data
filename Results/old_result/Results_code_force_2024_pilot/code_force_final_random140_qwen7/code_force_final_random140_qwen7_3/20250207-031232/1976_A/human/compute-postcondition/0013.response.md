Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over each character `ch` in the variable `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `letters` contains the original alphabetic characters plus the character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic. Otherwise, it is an empty string. `digits` contains the digit `ch` if `ch` is a digit, and remains unchanged otherwise.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `ch` must be a character from `password`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `ch` will be the next character from `password`.
   - `letters` will be updated based on whether `ch` is alphabetic or not.
   - `digits` will be updated based on whether `ch` is a digit or not.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `ch` will be the next character from `password`.
- `letters` will be updated to include `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise it will remain as it was in the previous iteration.
- `digits` will be updated to include `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise it will remain as it was in the previous iteration.

Since we don't know the exact value of `ch` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as follows:

**State: **`letters` is a string containing the original alphabetic characters plus the character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic (where `ch` is the next character from `password`), otherwise it is an empty string. `digits` is a string containing the digit `ch` if `ch` is a digit, and remains unchanged otherwise.**
