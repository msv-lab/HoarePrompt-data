Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(n, password)` from `test_cases`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `test_cases`. Each iteration processes one element `(n, password)`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `n` represents the number associated with the current test case.
   - The variable `password` represents the password string associated with the current test case.
   - The variable `results` is updated based on the conditions within the loop body.

4. **Analyze the postcondition**: The postcondition indicates that `results` contains 'NO'. This means that either `letters` is not sorted compared to its original state, or `digits` is not sorted compared to its original state, or both. Additionally, if the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`, `results` will contain two 'NO' entries; otherwise, it will contain 'NO' and 'YES'.

5. **Prepare for the next iteration**:
   - Since we are moving to the next iteration, we need to ensure that the loop can continue with the next element in `test_cases`.
   - The variables `n` and `password` will change to the next element in `test_cases`.
   - The `results` variable will be reset or updated based on the new `password` and other relevant variables (`letters` and `digits`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in `test_cases`.

**Answer**:
State: **`results` contains 'NO', `n` is the next number in `test_cases`, and `password` is the next password string in `test_cases`**. 

To be precise, since the exact values of `n` and `password` depend on the contents of `test_cases`, we can represent them symbolically. 

**Final State**:
State: **`results` contains 'NO', `n` is the next number in `test_cases`, `password` is the next password string in `test_cases`**.
