Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', `n` is the next value from the `test_cases` list, `password` is the corresponding string from the `test_cases` list, `letters` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty string `letters`. This does not affect the values of `results`, `n`, or `password`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. After executing the line `letters = ''`, the variable `letters` is set to an empty string.
