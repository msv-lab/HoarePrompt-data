Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly processes each password to check if the letters and digits are in sorted order.
2. It also correctly checks if the last letter comes before the first digit in the password.
3. The logic for determining if the password is strong is correct based on the problem description.
4. The function handles all edge cases, such as passwords containing only letters or only digits, and ensures that the conditions are met.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong according to the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
