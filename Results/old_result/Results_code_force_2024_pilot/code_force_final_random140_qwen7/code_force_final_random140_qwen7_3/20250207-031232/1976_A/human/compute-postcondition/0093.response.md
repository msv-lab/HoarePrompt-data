Output State: **`password` must contain at least one character; `ch` is the next character in `password`; `digits` is the concatenation of `digits` and `ch`.**

Explanation: The variable `digits` is assigned the value of `ch`, which means `digits` is updated to include the character `ch`. The other variables remain unchanged.
