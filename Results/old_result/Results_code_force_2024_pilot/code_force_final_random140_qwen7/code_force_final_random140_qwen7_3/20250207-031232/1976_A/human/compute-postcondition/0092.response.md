Output State: **`password` must contain at least one character; `letters` now includes the character `ch`.**

Explanation: The variable `letters` is updated by appending the character `ch` to its current value. Since `ch` is the next character in `password`, `letters` now includes this character. The precondition that `password` must contain at least one character remains unchanged.
