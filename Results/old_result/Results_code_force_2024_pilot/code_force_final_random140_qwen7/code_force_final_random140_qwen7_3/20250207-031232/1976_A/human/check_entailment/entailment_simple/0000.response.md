### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and each password's details. It stores these details in the `test_cases` list, which is structured as tuples containing the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each password in `test_cases`.
   - It separates the password into two parts: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if there is a digit immediately following a letter, which would violate the conditions.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - The function correctly checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted()`.
   - It correctly checks if there is a digit immediately following a letter by comparing the indices of the last letter and the first digit in the password.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The function appends `'NO'` to `results` if any of the conditions are violated.
   - Otherwise, it appends `'YES'`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits correctly.
   - It handles the case where the password has both letters and digits and ensures that the digits come after the letters.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to verify if a password is strong according to the specified conditions.
