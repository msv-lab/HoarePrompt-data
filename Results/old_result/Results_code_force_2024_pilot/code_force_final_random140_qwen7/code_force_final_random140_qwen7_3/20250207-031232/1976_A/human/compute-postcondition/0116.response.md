Output State: **`results` contains either 'NO' repeated as many times as there are elements in `test_cases`, or 'NO' followed by 'YES' if any password meets the conditions to be labeled as 'YES'.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will be a list containing either 'NO' for every password in `test_cases`, indicating that no password met the specified conditions throughout all iterations. Alternatively, if any password in `test_cases` satisfies the conditions (i.e., `letters` and `digits` are sorted and the last letter does not appear before the first digit in the password), 'YES' will be appended to the list of 'NO's. The exact composition of `results` depends on the content of `test_cases` and how each password is processed through the loop.
