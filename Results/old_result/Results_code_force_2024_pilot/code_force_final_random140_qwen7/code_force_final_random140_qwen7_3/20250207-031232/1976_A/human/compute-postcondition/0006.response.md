Output State: **`letters` is a string containing the original alphabetic characters plus the character `ch`, `digits` is a string, `ch` is a character from the password and it is alphabetic.**

Explanation: The code `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `letters`. Since `ch` is specified to be an alphabetic character, it is added to `letters`. The variable `digits` remains unchanged, and `ch` retains its alphabetic nature.
