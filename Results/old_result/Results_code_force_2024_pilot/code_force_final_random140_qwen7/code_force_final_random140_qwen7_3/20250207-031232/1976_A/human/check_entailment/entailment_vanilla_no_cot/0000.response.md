Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. The function `func_1` processes each password according to the rules outlined in the problem statement and appends the appropriate result ('YES' or 'NO') to the `results` list. The main part of the script reads the input and calls `func_1` to get the results, which it then prints out. Given the problem description and the example provided, the program functions as intended without any errors.
