Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character; `ch` is the next character in `password`; if `ch` is a letter, then `letters` now includes the character `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is the concatenation of `digits` and `ch`. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, then both `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged.
