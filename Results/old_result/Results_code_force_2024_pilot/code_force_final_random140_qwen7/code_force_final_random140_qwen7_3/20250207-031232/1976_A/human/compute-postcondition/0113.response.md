Output State: **`letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` contains all the digit characters from the `password` string, `results` is a list containing the elements 'NO' and 'YES', and either `letters` is not sorted or `digits` is not sorted or the last letter in `letters` comes before the first digit in `digits` according to the index in the `password` string.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained only `'NO'`. After executing the code, `results` now contains both `'NO'` and `'YES'`. The conditions regarding the sorting of `letters` and `digits`, and the relative positions of the last letter and the first digit in the `password` string remain unchanged.
