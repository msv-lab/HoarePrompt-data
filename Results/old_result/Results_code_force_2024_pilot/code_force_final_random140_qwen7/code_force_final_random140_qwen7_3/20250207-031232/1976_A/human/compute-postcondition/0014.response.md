Output State: **`letters` is a string containing the original alphabetic characters plus the character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise it is the same as before; `digits` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `letters` if `ch` is alphabetic. If `ch` is not alphabetic, the value of `letters` remains unchanged. The variable `digits` is not affected by this operation, so its state remains the same as before.
