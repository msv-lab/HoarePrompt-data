Postcondition: **`results` contains 'NO', `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, and `digits` is a string containing all the digit characters from the `password` string, with each digit repeated according to its occurrence in the `password` string.**

This means that if the list of letters is not sorted or the list of digits is not sorted, the function sets `results` to 'NO'. The strings `letters` and `digits` retain their original properties as specified in the precondition.
