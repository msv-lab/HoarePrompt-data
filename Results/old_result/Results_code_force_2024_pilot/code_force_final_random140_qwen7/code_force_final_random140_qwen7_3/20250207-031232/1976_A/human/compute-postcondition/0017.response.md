Postcondition: `letters` is a string containing the original alphabetic characters plus the character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic (where `ch` is the next character from `password`), otherwise it is an empty string; `digits` is a string containing the digit `ch` if `ch` is a digit, and remains unchanged otherwise; if `ch` is a digit, `digits` is updated by appending the character `ch` to itself.
