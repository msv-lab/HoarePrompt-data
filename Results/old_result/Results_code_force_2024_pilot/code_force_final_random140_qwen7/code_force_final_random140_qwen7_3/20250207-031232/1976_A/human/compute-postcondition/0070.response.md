Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', the letters variable is not sorted compared to its original state, and the digits variable is not sorted compared to its original state.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified or checked within the context of the `continue` statement, the values of `results`, `letters`, and `digits` remain unchanged from their initial state.
