Output State: **`letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` contains all the digit characters from the `password` string, `results` is a list containing two elements 'NO', and the last character in `letters` appears later in the `password` string than the first character in `digits`.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained one element `'NO'`. After appending, `results` now contains two elements: `'NO'` and `'NO'`. The other conditions and the contents of `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged.
