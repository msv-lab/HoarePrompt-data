Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', and 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contained either `'Bob'`, `'Alice'`, or `'Draw'`. After appending `'Draw'`, `answers` now contains `'Bob'`, `'Alice'`, and `'Draw'`. Additionally, the variable `i` is incremented by 1 (since it was initially 1), making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
