Postcondition: `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers, `n` is the second element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is either 1 or `m`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` adjusted by `a` depending on the condition, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, `(x2 - x1)` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `m - y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `x2 > x1` and `x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n`, and `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` based on the condition.
