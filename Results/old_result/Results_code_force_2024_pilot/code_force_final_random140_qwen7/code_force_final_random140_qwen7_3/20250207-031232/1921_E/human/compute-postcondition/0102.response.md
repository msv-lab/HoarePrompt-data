Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Alice'`, or `'Draw'`. After appending `'Alice'`, `answers` will contain `'Bob'` (if it was there), `'Alice'` (newly added), and possibly `'Draw'` if it was already in the list. The value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2), and `clues` remains unchanged.
