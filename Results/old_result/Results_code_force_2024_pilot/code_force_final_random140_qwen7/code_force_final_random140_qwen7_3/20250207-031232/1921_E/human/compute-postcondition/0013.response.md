Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers where n is the first element, m is the second element, x1 is incremented by 1, y1 is incremented by 1, x2 is the fifth element, and y2 is the sixth element.**

In this output state, the value of `x1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
