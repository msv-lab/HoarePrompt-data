Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers where the first element (n) is the first element of r, the second element (m) is the second element of r, the third element (x1) is the third element of r, the fourth element (y1) is the fourth element of r, the fifth element (x2) is the fifth element of r, and the sixth element (y2) is the sixth element of r. The first element of r (x2) is less than or equal to the third element of r (x1).**
