Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split. The values of `test_cases`, `answers`, and `clues` remain unchanged, and `i` is set to 2 regardless of whether the condition `clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)` is true or false.**
