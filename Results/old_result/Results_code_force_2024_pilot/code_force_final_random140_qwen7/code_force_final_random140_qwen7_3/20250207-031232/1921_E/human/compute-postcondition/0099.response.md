Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', `i` is 2 if `clues[3] < clues[5]` or if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, otherwise `i` remains 1. `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split.
