Output State: `test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user for each iteration, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw' for each of the `test_cases` iterations, and `answers` must have exactly `test_cases` elements.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `test_cases` remains a positive integer, `i` is still equal to `test_cases`, `clues` and `answers` remain as lists of integers and strings respectively, with each list having exactly `test_cases` elements, as all elements have been processed through the loop.
