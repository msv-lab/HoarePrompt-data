Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is the third element of r, y1 is the fourth element of r, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, and (x2 - x1) is even, y1 is not equal to y2, y2 is greater than or equal to y1, a is y1 - 1.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is assigned the value `y1 - 1`. All other variables retain their original conditions and values from the initial state.
