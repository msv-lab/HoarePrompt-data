Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers where n is the first element, m is the second element, x1 is incremented by 1, y1 is either incremented by 1 or one less than the original y1, x2 is the fifth element, and y2 is the sixth element. Additionally, x2 is greater than x1, and y1 is not equal to y2. The current value of y1 is equal to the current value of y2.**
