Output State: **`t` is now the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers, `n` is the second element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, and `(x2 - x1)` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `t` to be the absolute value of `y2 - y1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
