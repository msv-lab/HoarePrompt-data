Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split. If `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, then `i` is set to 2. In both cases (whether the condition is true or false), the values of `test_cases`, `answers`, `i`, and `clues` remain as specified in the precondition.
