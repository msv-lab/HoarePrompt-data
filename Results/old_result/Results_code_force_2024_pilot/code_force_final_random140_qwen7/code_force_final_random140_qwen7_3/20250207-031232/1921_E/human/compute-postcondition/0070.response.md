Output State: **`t` is now the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers, `n` is the second element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, and `(x2 - x1)` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `m - y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `x2` is decreased by `a`. Since `a` is defined as `m - y1` (based on the condition given), `x2` is decreased by `m - y1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
