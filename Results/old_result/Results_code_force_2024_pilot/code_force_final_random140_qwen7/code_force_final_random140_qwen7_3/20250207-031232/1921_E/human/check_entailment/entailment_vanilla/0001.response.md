### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input into individual test case parameters and stores them in `clues`.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if `clues[2] > clues[4]` or if `clues[0] == 1`. If true, it appends 'Draw' to the answers list. This condition seems to handle some basic scenarios where Alice or Bob cannot make a move, leading to a draw.

3. **Even and Odd Position Checks**:
   - The program checks if both Alice's and Bob's initial positions are even or odd. This is an important part of determining the winner because the movement rules imply that the parity (even/odd nature) of the positions affects who can force a win.
   - If both positions are even or both are odd, it further checks the relative positions of Alice and Bob's chips.
     - If Alice and Bob are on the same column (`clues[3] == clues[5]`), it directly appends 'Bob' to the answers list.
     - If Alice is to the left of Bob (`clues[3] < clues[5]`), it checks if Bob can move closer to Alice within the constraints. If Bob can't, it appends 'Draw'; otherwise, it appends 'Bob'.
     - If Alice is to the right of Bob (`clues[3] > clues[5]`), it performs similar checks but considers Alice's position relative to the board boundaries.

4. **Different Parity Positions**:
   - If the positions are different (one even, one odd), the program directly appends 'Alice' to the answers list, indicating that Alice can always force a win under these conditions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where Alice or Bob might be at the boundary rows, which could lead to immediate draws if no further moves are possible.

### Analysis:
The logic in the program seems to correctly implement the game rules and outcomes based on the given problem description. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:
- The program assumes that the board dimensions and initial positions are valid, but it does not explicitly validate these inputs.
- The program's logic for handling the different parity cases and edge conditions appears to be sound, but it might benefit from more detailed comments and edge case testing.

Given the provided examples and the logical flow of the program, it appears to be correctly implementing the game rules and determining the outcomes accurately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the game rules and logic to determine the outcome of the game for each test case.
