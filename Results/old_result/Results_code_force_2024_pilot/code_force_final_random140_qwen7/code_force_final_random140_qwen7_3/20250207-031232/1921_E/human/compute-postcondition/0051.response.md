Based on the initial state provided, we need to determine the values of the variables involved in the condition and then understand what will be printed.

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `r` is a list containing six integers: `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.
   - `a` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1 >= y2` is true or false.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`.
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - `x2` is not decreased by `a`, and `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is not greater than `n`.
   - `c` is `y1 - 1` if `y2` is 1, otherwise `c` is `m - y1`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `(b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c and (1 <= y1 <= m) and (1 <= x1 <= n))` must be true.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Alice')`.

Given the condition and the print statement, the output will be the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
