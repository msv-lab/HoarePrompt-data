Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function indirectly accepts six parameters (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) through its input, where each parameter has specific constraints. The function then returns a value based on whether x_a equals x_b or y_a equals y_b, ensuring at least one of these coordinates differs between the two points.
