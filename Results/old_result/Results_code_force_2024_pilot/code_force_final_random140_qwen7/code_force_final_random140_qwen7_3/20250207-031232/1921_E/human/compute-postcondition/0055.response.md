Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their relationships:

1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `r` is a list containing six integers: `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.
3. `x1` is incremented by `a`.
4. `y1` is adjusted (either incremented or decremented by `a`).
5. `x2` is the fifth element of the list.
6. `y2` is either `1` or `m`.
7. `a` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1 >= y2` is true or false.
8. `b` is `x2 - x1`.
9. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
10. `x2` is not decreased by `a`.
11. `x2` is greater than `x1`.
12. `x1` is at least 1.
13. `x2` is not greater than `n`.
14. `c` is `y1 - 1` if `y2` is `1`, otherwise `c` is `m - y1`.

Given these conditions, the print statement is `print('draw')`.

The output does not depend on the specific values of the variables but rather on the fact that the print statement itself is `print('draw')`.

Output: **draw**
