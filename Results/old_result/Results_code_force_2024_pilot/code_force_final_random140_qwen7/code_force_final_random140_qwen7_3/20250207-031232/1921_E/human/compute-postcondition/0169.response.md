Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six positive integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it determines whether Alice, Bob, or a Draw occurs based on specific conditions related to these integers. The function then prints the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') for each test case.**
