Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by six integers: \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). Based on the values of \(x_a\) and \(x_b\), it determines the winner of a game or prints "draw" if no clear winner can be determined. The function reads these inputs from standard input, performs a series of conditional checks, and updates the positions of two players on a grid. Depending on the conditions met, it may print "Alice", "Bob", or "draw". The function returns None in most cases, except when it returns a specific value related to the positions of the players.**
