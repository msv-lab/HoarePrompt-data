Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw'. If `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, the `answers` list remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `clues[3] > clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, the `answers` list remains unchanged as well. If none of these conditions are met, 'Bob' is appended to the `answers` list.
