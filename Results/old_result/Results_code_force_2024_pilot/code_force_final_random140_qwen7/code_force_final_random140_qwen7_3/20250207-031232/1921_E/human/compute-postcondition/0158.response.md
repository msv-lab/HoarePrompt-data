Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user for each iteration, and `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw' for each of the `test_cases` iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` will be the same as the final value it had after the last iteration, which is equal to the total number of test cases processed. The variable `i` will be equal to `test_cases` since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `test_cases - 1` and then stops. For each of the `test_cases` iterations, `clues` will be a list of integers entered by the user, and `answers` will contain the outcome ('Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw') determined for each set of `clues` according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
