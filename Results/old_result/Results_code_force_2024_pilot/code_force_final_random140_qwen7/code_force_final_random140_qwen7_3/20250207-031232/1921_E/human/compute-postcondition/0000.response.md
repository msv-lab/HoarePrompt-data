Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter.**

Explanation: The code `r = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `r`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code.
