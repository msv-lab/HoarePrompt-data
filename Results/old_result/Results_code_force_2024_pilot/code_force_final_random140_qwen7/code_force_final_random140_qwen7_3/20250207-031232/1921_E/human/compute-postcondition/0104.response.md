Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', and 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and split.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contained either `'Bob'` and/or `'Alice'`, and now it includes `'Draw'`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 because the list `answers` grows by one element, making `i` equal to 2. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the value of `clues` also remains the same as it was before the code execution.
