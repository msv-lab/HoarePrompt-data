Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers where `n` is the first element, `m` is the second element, `x1` is incremented by `a`, `y1` is decremented by `a`, `x2` is the fifth element, `y2` is 1, `a` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `y1 >= y2` is true or false, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is not decreased by `a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is not greater than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `y1` has been updated by subtracting `a` from its previous value. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
