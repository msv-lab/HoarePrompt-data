Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw' with an additional element 'Bob' appended.**

This means that the `answers` list now includes the string `'Bob'` in addition to possibly other elements like `'Alice'` or `'Draw'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
