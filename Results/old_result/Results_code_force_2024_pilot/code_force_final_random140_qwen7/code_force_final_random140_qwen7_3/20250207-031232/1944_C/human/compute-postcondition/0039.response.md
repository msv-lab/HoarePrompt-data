Output State: **`ans` is 1, `once` is False, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i`, which is initially 1. The values of `once` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 (though this increment is not explicitly shown in the given code snippet, it is implied by the context).
