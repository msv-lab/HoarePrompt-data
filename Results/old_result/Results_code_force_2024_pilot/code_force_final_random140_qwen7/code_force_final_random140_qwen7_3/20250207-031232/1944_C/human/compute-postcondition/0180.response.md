Output State: **`once` is `True`, `ans` is `4`, `i` is `3`, `n` is a positive integer, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `ans = i + 1` updates the value of `ans` by adding 1 to the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `ans` becomes 4. The other variables (`once`, `n`, `t`, and `next_i`) remain unchanged.
