Output State: **`once` is True, `i` is 0, `ans` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `once`, `i`, `n`, and `counter.get(i, 0)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
