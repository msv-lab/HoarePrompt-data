Output State: **ans is either 3, 4, or 5, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is n-1, `t` must be greater than 0, and the loop has executed all its iterations.**

In this final state, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `ans` will be set to the smallest integer in `arr` that appears exactly once, or the next available integer if no such integer exists. The `counter` dictionary will reflect the counts of all elements in `arr`. The variable `once` will be True because it was set to True when the first element with a count of one was encountered. The variable `n` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is the length of `arr`. The variable `i` will be the last index of `arr` (i.e., `n-1`). The variable `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
