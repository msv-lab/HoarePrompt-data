Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` to maximize and minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, respectively.
2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`.
   - Bob can only pick elements from `a` without appending them to `c`.
3. **Objective**: The goal is to determine the final MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally.
4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX.
5. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code uses a dictionary `counter` to count occurrences of each element in the input array `arr`.
   - It iterates through numbers from `0` to `n-1` and checks the count of each number.
   - If a number `i` is not present (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and hasn't been set yet (`not once`), it sets `ans` to `i + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `ans` to `i`.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players.
   - Specifically, the code assumes that the first missing number (or the next number after the last unique number) will be the MEX, which is not always correct.
   - The optimal strategy would involve more complex decision-making based on the counts and the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game.

Correctness: **False**
