Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, excluding the current value of `i`; `counter[i]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `counter[i]` by incrementing it by 1 using the `get` method from the dictionary. If `i` is not already a key in `counter`, `get(i, 0)` returns 0, and then 1 is added to it, effectively setting `counter[i]` to 1. If `i` is already a key in `counter`, its value is incremented by 1. The precondition that `arr` must have at least one element, excluding the current value of `i`, remains unchanged.
