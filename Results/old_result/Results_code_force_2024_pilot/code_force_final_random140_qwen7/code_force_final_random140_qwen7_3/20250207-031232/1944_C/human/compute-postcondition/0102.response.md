Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers. If the count of the current element `i` in `arr` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the count of the current element `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` remains False, or the count of the current element `i` in `arr` is not 1, the `counter` dictionary and other variables remain unchanged.
