Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `arr` has at least one element.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` must have at least one element.
   - `counter[i]` is incremented by 1, meaning `i` is an element of `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still have at least one element.
   - Since `counter[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is no longer part of `arr` (assuming the loop body removes or modifies `i` from `arr`).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `arr` must still have at least one element, but it cannot include the current value of `i`.
   - `counter[i]` is incremented by 1, so the new state should reflect that `i` is no longer in `arr`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` must have at least one element, excluding the current value of `i`; `counter[i]` is incremented by 1**.
