Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `counter[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `counter[i]` by incrementing it by 1. Since `counter.get(i, 0)` returns the value of `counter[i]` if it exists, or 0 if it does not, and then adds 1 to it, `counter[i]` is effectively incremented by 1. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `counter[i]` is included in the output state.
