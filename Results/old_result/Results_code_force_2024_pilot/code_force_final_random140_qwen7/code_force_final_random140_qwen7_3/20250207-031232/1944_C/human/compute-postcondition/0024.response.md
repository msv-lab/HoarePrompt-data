Output State: **`once` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1**

Explanation: The code `once = True` does not change the value of `once`. It only reassigns `once` to `True`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `counter.get(i, 0)`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
