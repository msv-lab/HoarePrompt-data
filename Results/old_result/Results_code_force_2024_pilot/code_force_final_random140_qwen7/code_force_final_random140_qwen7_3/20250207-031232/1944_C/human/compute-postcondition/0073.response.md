Output State: **`counter` is {'i': 3}, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must contain at least one element**

Explanation: The code `counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1` increments the count of the key `'i'` in the dictionary `counter`. Initially, `counter['i']` is 2. After executing the code, the value of `counter['i']` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
