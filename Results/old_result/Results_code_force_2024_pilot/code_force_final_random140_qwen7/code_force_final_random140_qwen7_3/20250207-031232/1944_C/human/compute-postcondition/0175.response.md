Postcondition: `once` is either `True` or `False`, `ans` is `1` if `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` initially, otherwise `ans` is `2` if `once` was initially `False` and `counter.get(1, 0) == 1`, and `ans` remains `1` if `once` was initially `True` or `counter.get(1, 0) != 1`. `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2`, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
