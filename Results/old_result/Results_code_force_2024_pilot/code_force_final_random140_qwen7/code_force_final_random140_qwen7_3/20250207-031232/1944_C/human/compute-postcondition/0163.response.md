Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `once` is either `True` or `False`.
   - `ans` is `0`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `t` is undefined.
   - `next_i` is undefined.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and the loop increments `i` by `1` each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `0`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is defined outside the loop.

5. **Update the other states**:
   - `once` remains unchanged unless the loop body sets it to `True` or `False`.
   - `ans` remains `0` unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `t` and `next_i` remain undefined unless the loop body defines them.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`once` is either `True` or `False`, `ans` is `0`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `1`, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined**.
