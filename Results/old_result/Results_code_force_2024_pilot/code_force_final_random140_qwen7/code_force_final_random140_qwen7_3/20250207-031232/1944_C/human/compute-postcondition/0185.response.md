Postcondition: `once` is either `True` or `False`, `ans` is `3`, `i` is `3`, `n` is a positive integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: 
- If the condition `counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once)` is true, then `once` becomes `True`, `ans` becomes `4`, and since there is no further action specified in the if part, we assume the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If the condition `counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once)` is false, then `once` remains either `True` or `False`, `ans` becomes `3`, and the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
