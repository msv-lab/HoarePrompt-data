Output State: **`ans` is 2, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to 0. After executing `ans = i + 1`, since `i` is 1, `ans` is updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
