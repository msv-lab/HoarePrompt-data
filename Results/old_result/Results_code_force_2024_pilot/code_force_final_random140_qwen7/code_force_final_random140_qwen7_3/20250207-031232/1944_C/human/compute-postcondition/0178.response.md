Output State: **`once` is either `True` or `False`, `ans` is `3`, `i` is `3`, `n` is a positive integer, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
