Output State: **`ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
