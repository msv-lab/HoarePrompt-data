Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive. The precondition that each test case consists of `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) and an array `a` of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n` remains valid. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = {}
    for i in arr:
        counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
    ans = 0
    once = False
    for i in range(n):
        if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
            ans = i
            break
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
            once = True
            ans = i + 1
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
            ans = i
            break
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either True or False, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans is either 3, 4, or 5, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is n-1, `t` must be greater than 0, and the loop has executed all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `once` is either `True` or `False`, `ans` is `3`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` inclusive. The variable `ans` will be set to `3` based on the conditions provided in the loop body. The variable `once` will retain its final value from the last iteration of the loop, which could be either `True` or `False` depending on the values in the `counter` dictionary. The other variables (`t` and `next_i`) are not affected by the loop and thus remain undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
