Output State: **`ans` is either 3, 4, or 5, `once` is True, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `t` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `arr`. The values of `ans`, `once`, `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. Additionally, a new variable `counter` is created, which will be a dictionary counting the occurrences of each element in `arr`, but its actual content is not determined until after the input is processed.
