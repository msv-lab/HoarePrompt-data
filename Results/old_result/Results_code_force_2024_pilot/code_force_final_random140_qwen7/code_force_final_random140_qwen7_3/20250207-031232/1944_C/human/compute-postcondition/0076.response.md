Output State: `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `once` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

In this final output state, the `counter` dictionary will contain each unique element from the `arr` list as keys, and their respective counts as values after all iterations of the loop have been executed. The other variables (`ans`, `once`, `n`, `t`, and `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
