Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - Given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\) inclusive, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the initial state to reflect this condition.

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
