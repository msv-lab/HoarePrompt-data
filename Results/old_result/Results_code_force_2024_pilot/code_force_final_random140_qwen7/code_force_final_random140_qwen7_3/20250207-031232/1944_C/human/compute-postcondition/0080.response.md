Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (since `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`).
   - The variable `n` is already given as an input integer.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate values from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.
   - The initial value of `i` should be 0, as the loop starts with `i = 0`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - We need to set `i` to 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers**.
