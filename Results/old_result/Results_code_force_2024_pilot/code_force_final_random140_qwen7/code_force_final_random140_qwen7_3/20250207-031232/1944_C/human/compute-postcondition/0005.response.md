Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr:`. This means the variables involved are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on the values from the list `arr` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `arr`: This is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `arr` is not empty. Therefore, the loop will execute if `arr` contains at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `arr` is a list of integers, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will change with each iteration, but we don't need to specify its exact value initially because it will be set by the loop itself.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We know `t` is greater than 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `n` is an input integer, but it doesn't influence the loop's execution based on the given information.
   - `counter` is an empty dictionary, which is irrelevant to the loop's execution.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` must have at least one element**
