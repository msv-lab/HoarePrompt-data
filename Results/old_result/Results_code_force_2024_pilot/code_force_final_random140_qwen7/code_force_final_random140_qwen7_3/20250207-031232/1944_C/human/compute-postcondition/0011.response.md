Output State: The `counter` dictionary will contain the count of each unique integer present in the list `arr`. Specifically, for every integer `i` in `arr`, `counter[i]` will hold the number of times `i` appears in `arr`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `counter` will map each distinct integer from `arr` to the frequency with which that integer appears in the list.
