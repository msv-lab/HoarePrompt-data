Output State: The `counter` dictionary will contain each unique element from the list `arr` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times each element appears in `arr`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `counter` dictionary will have been updated to reflect the frequency of each integer present in the list `arr`.
