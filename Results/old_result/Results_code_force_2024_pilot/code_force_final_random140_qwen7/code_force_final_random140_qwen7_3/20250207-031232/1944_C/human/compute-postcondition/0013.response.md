Output State: **`ans` is 0**.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The code snippet `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to `ans`. No other variables are affected, and the initial state of the `counter` dictionary remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is now explicitly set to 0.
