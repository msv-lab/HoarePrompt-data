Output State: **`once` is True, `ans` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined, `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states.
