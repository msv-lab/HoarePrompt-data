The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \), followed by an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the smallest integer \( i \) such that the count of \( i \) in the array is exactly 1. If no such integer exists, it prints 3. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
