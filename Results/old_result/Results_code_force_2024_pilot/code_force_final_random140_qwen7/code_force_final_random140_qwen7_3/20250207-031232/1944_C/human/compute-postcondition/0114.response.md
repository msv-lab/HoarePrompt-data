Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
