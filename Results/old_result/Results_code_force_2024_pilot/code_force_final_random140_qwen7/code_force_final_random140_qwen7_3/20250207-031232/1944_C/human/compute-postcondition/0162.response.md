Postcondition: **`once` is either True or False, `ans` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `t` is undefined, `next_i` is undefined. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is not 0, `once` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
