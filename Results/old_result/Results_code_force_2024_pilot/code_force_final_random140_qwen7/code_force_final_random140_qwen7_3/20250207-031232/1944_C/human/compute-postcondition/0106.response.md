Output State: **`ans` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `arr`, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` must be a list of integers.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `once`. This changes the value of `once` from `False` to `True`, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
