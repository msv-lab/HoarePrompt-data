Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in arr:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is set to `n-1` initially.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already initialized to `n-1`, it doesn't need adjustment as it is not used directly in the loop.
   - `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final State:**
State: **`ans` is either 3, 4, or 5, `once` is True, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `t` must be greater than 1, `arr` must contain at least one element, `counter` is an empty dictionary**
