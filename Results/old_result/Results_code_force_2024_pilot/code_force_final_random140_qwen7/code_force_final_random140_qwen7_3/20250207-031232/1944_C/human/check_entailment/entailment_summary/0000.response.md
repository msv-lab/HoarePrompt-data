Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program focuses on counting occurrences of each integer in the array and determining the smallest integer that appears exactly once. However, the game involves two different types of moves by Alice and Bob, and the MEX is calculated at the end based on the final state of Alice's array \( c \).

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:
1. **Game Rules Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. Alice can pick any element from the array \( a \) and append it to her array \( c \), while Bob only removes elements.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The program does not calculate the MEX of Alice's array \( c \) after the game ends. Instead, it attempts to find the smallest integer that appears exactly once in the original array, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. It assumes that the smallest integer appearing exactly once will be the MEX, which is not always true given the game dynamics.

Given these points, the program does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX of Alice's final array \( c \) under optimal play.

Correctness: **False**
