Output: **(a - c)² + (b - d)² (where a and b are input integers, and c and d are the first and second integers entered respectively)**

Explanation:
- `n` is defined as `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, which simplifies to \((a - c)² + (b - d)²\).
- The value of `n` is directly computed from the given inputs and does not depend on any other variables or conditions.
- The `print(n)` statement will output the value of `n`, which is \((a - c)² + (b - d)²\).
