Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `e` and the second integer to `f`. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged.
