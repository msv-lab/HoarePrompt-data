Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`**.

This means that `n` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `c`, and `b` and `d`. All other variables retain their initial states.
