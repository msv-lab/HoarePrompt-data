Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `g` and `h` respectively. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
