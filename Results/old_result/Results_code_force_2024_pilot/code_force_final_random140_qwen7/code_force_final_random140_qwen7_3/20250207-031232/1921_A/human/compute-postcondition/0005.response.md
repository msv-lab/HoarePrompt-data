Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `g` and `h`. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
