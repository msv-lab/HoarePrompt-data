Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for steps in range(t):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `steps` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `steps` is currently 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `steps` must be less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `steps` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `steps` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` must still be greater than 0.
- `steps` must be 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2**
