Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 1 (though `steps` is not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` and `d` are integers from the input split.
- `e` is the first integer from the input split, so `e = c`.
- `f` is the second integer from the input split, so `f = d`.
- `g` and `h` are integers from the input split (though they are not used in the calculation of `x`).
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\), but this value is not needed for the print statement.
- `x` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\). Since `e = c` and `f = d`, this simplifies to \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).

Therefore, the value of `x` is the same as the value of `n`.

Output: **(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)**
