Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` is the first integer entered.
- `d` is the second integer entered.
- `e` is the first integer from input split.
- `f` is the second integer from input split.
- `g` is the first integer from the split input converted to an integer.
- `h` is the second integer from the split input converted to an integer.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2\).
- `x` is calculated as \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\).

The print statement only references `n`, which is \((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2\). Since `c` and `d` are the first and second integers entered, respectively, and `a` and `b` are the same input integers, `n` will be the squared distance between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\).

Output: **(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2**
