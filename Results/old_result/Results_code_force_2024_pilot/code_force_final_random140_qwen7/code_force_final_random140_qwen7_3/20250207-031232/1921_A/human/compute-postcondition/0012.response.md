Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, then no changes are made. If `x` is less than or equal to `n`, then no changes are made as well.**
