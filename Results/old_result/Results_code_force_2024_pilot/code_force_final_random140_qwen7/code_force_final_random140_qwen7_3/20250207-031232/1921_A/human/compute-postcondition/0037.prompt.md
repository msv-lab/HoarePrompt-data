You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. Each testcase is represented by four lines, where each line contains two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. It is guaranteed that these points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
        
        x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed all iterations specified by the initial value of `t`. After all iterations, `steps` will be equal to `t-1`, and the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will each hold the last values they were assigned during the loop's final iteration. The variable `n` will be set to \((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2\) and `x` will be set to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\). If `x` is greater than `n` during the last iteration, `n` will retain its value from the last iteration. Otherwise, `x` will retain its value from the last iteration. No other variables are changed outside of the loop, so their values remain as they were after the third iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It processes four lines of input, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. Based on these coordinates, the function returns whether the given points form a valid square.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
