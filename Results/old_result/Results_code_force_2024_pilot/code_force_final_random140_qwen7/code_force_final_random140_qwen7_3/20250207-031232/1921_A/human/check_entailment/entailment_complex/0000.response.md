Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to calculate the area of a square by finding the squared distance between two pairs of opposite corners and printing the larger of the two distances. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the calculated distances correspond to the diagonals of the square. The correct method to determine the side length of the square would be to find the distance between any two adjacent corners.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function calculates the squared distance between pairs of opposite corners (e.g., \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\)) and \((a, b)\) and \((e, f)\). This does not necessarily give the diagonal length of the square.
2. **No Check for Adjacent Corners**: The function does not check the distances between adjacent corners to ensure they are equal, which is a necessary condition for the points to form a square.
3. **Potential Incorrect Output**: Since the distances calculated might not be the actual side lengths of the square, the output area could be incorrect.

To fix this, the function should:
1. Calculate the distances between all pairs of points.
2. Identify the smallest distance, which should be the side length of the square.
3. Square this distance to get the area.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
