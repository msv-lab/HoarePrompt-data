Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial conditions for `t` and `steps` remain unchanged.
