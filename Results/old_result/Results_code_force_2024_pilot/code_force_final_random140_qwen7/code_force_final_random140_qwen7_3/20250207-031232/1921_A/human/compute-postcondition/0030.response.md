Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split, `f` is the second integer from input split, `g` is the first integer from the split input converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the split input converted to an integer, `n` is (a - c)² + (b - d)², `x` is (a - e)² + (b - f)²**.

Explanation: The code calculates `x` as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. This means `x` is the squared distance between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)` in a 2D plane. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
