Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes four lines of input, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. Based on these coordinates, the function returns whether the given points form a valid square.**

Note: The actual logic to determine if the points form a valid square is not described here as per the instruction.
