Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly finds the area of the square:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Coordinates Reading**: For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(a, b)`, `(c, d)`, `(e, f)`, and `(g, h)`.
3. **Distance Calculation**: It calculates the squared distance between the points using the formula \( (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 \).
4. **Comparison and Output**: It compares the distances and prints the smaller one, assuming that the smaller distance represents the side length squared of the square.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Distance Calculation**: The distance calculation is correct. The squared distance between any two points should be calculated as \( (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 \).
- **Assumption**: The assumption that the smaller distance will always represent the side length squared of the square is not necessarily true. This is because the points could form a rectangle rather than a square. The problem guarantees that the points form a square, but the code does not account for this.
- **Comparison Logic**: The logic of comparing the distances and printing the smaller one might not always yield the correct result. Since the problem guarantees a square, we need to ensure that the side lengths are consistent.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the side length of the square. Given that the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among the four points.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        
        # Calculate the differences
        max_diff_x = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        max_diff_y = max(y_coords) - min(y_coords)
        
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        area = max(max_diff_x, max_diff_y) ** 2
        print(area)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program incorrectly assumes that the smaller distance will always be the side length squared, which is not always true. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
