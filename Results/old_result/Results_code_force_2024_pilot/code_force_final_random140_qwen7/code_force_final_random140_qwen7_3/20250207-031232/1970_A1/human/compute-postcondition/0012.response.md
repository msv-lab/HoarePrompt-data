Output State: **`positions` is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, char2), `i` is 1, `balance` is 1 more than its initial value.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `positions` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, 1, char2)`. The value of `balance` within this tuple is initially 1. The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the `balance` by 1. Since `i` and `char` are not affected by this code, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated tuple in `positions` will have `balance` as 2 (1 + 1).
