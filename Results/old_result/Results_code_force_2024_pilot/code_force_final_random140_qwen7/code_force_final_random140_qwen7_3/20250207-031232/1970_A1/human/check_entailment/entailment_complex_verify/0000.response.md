### Reasoning:

The provided program indeed correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the steps and verify the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace, ensuring the input is processed correctly.

2. **Tracking Balance and Positions**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`, maintaining a running balance of the number of open parentheses.
   - For each character, it appends a tuple `(balance, i, char)` to the `positions` list, where `balance` is the net count of open parentheses up to that point, `i` is the index of the character, and `char` is the character itself.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The `positions` list is then sorted based on the `balance` value and, in case of ties, by the negative of the index `i`. Sorting by the negative of the index ensures that in case of equal balances, the later characters (higher indices) come first.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - Finally, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `positions` list and concatenating them.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the program correctly follows the steps to compute the balanced shuffle. The logic is sound, and the implementation matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
