Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string `s`, and the first character of `s` is not '(', `balance` is -1.**

The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Given that the initial value of `balance` is not specified but implied to be 0 (since it's not mentioned otherwise), it becomes -1 after executing the code. All other variables remain unchanged.
