Output State: **positions is a list containing one tuple (balance, i, char), `i` is 0, and `char` is the first character of `s`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(balance, i, char)` to the list `positions`. Given the initial state, `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether the first character of `s` is '('. The value of `i` is 0 because the position is considered starting from 0, and `char` is the first character of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
