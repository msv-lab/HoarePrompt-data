Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `balance` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, `s` remains a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `n` remains the length of the string `s`. The variable `balance` is now set to 0.
