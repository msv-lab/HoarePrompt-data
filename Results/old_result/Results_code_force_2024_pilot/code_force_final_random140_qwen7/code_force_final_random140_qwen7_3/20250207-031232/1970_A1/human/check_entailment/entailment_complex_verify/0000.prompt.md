You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for (_, _, char) in positions])
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: positions is a list containing tuples (balance, i, char) for each character in the string s, where balance is the net count of '(' minus ')' up to that index, i is the index of the current character, and char is the character at that index.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string composed of characters from the third element of each tuple in `positions`, ordered by the original sorting criteria of `balance` and `-i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" characters, representing a balanced parentheses sequence. It processes this string by tracking the balance of parentheses and their positions, sorts the results based on the balance and index, and finally returns a new string composed of the characters from the sorted tuples.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the balance of each prefix, records the positions and characters, sorts them according to the specified criteria, and constructs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence. The code handles all characters in the input string and ensures that the final output is a valid balanced shuffle sequence. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to be correct for all potential cases.
