Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance` is 0; `positions` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `positions`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `balance`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
