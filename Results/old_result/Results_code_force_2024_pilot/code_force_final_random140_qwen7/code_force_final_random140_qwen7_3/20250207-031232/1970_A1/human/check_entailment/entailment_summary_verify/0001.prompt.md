You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for (_, _, char) in positions])
    return result



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" characters, representing a balanced parentheses sequence. It processes this string by tracking the balance of parentheses and their positions, sorts the results based on the balance and index, and finally returns a new string composed of the characters from the sorted tuples.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and passes it to the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the input string.
     - `balance = 0` initializes the balance counter.
     - `positions = []` initializes an empty list to store tuples of balance, position, and character.
   - **Building the Positions List:**
     - A loop iterates over each character in the string using `enumerate`.
     - For each character:
       - If the character is `(`, the balance is incremented.
       - If the character is `)`, the balance is decremented.
       - A tuple `(balance, i, char)` is appended to the `positions` list, where `i` is the index of the character.
   - **Sorting the Positions:**
     - The `positions` list is sorted using a key that sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order.
   - **Constructing the Result String:**
     - A list comprehension constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted positions.
     - The resulting string is returned.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

1. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the balance at each position and stores it along with the character and its index.

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The sorting logic ensures that the positions are sorted first by balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order. This is consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - The final result is constructed by concatenating the characters from the sorted positions, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles strings of varying lengths, including edge cases like single-character sequences or very long sequences (up to 500,000 characters).
- The input is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, so the balance will always be non-negative at each step.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly implements the steps described in the problem statement and handles all necessary cases, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
