Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` and strips any leading/trailing whitespace.
2. It initializes an empty list `positions` to store tuples of balance, position, and character.
3. It iterates through each character in the string, updating the balance and appending the current balance, position, and character to the `positions` list.
4. After collecting all the data, it sorts the `positions` list based on the balance (in ascending order) and position (in descending order) using a lambda function as the key for sorting.
5. Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `positions` list and returns it.

Given the steps and the logic implemented, the program should correctly perform the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
