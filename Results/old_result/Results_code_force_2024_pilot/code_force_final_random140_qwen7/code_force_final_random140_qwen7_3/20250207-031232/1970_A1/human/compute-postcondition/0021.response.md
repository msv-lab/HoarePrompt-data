Postcondition: `positions` is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, char2), `i` is 3, `balance` is either 1 more than its initial value if `char` is '(', or `balance` is decreased by 2 from its initial value if `char` is not '('.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of whether `char` is '(', `balance` will be adjusted by either +1 or -2 from its initial value.
