Output State: **`q` is 0, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R(), `t` is False, `a` is a list containing 0, `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes three new variables `p`, `i`, and `j` to 0. The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
