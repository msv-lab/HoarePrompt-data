Output State: **`p` is equal to the next value of `x` from `R()`, `j` is set to `i` if the next value of `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value, `a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `j = (j, i)[x != p]` uses a tuple selection to assign `j` the value of `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, or keeps `j` as its original value if `x` is equal to `p`. The values of `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is updated based on the condition, and `a` is increased by the new value of `j`.
