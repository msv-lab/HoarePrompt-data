Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `q` is `q - 1`
  - `l` is a value returned by `R()`
  - `r` is a value returned by `R()`
- The loop condition is `while q:`

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `q` is non-zero (i.e., `q != 0`).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `q` has been decremented by 1, meaning `q` is now `q - 1`.

### Determining the Next State:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be non-zero.
- Since `q` was `q - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `q` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we need to ensure that `q` is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`**
