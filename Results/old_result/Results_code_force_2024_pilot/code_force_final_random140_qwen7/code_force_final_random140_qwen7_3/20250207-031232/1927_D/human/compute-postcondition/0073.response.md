Output State: **`q` is `0`, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `q` is truthy (non-zero). After each iteration, `q` is decremented by 1. Given that the loop outputs the state after executing 3 times, it implies that `q` started with a value of at least 3. After 3 iterations, `q` would be reduced to 0. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `q` will be `0`, and `l` and `r` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, which are both new values returned by `R()`.
