Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The logic inside the loop where queries are processed is flawed. Specifically, the condition `print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])` is incorrect. It checks if `a[r]` is less than `l`, which doesn't make sense in the context of finding distinct elements within the range `[l, r]`.

2. **Array Initialization and Update**: The array `a` is initialized incorrectly and updated in a way that doesn't help in solving the problem. The variable `p` and `i` and `j` are used in a manner that doesn't track the distinct elements correctly.

3. **Logic for Finding Distinct Elements**: The logic to find distinct elements within the range `[l, r]` is missing. The current implementation doesn't maintain a record of elements within the queried range to check for distinctness.

### Correct Solution Approach:
A correct approach would involve maintaining a set or dictionary to keep track of the elements seen so far within the range `[l, r]`. For each query, you can then check if there are any distinct elements by comparing the set size before and after adding the new element.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    from collections import defaultdict

    R = lambda: map(int, input().split)

    t = next(R())[0]
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = next(R())[0]
        a = list(next(R()))
        q = next(R())[0]
        
        # Dictionary to store the last occurrence of each element
        last_occurrence = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(n):
            last_occurrence[a[i]] = i
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = next(R())
            distinct_elements = set(a[l-1:r])
            if len(distinct_elements) > 1:
                print(l, l + 1)  # Print any two distinct indices
            else:
                print(-1, -1)

func()
```

This solution maintains a dictionary to track the last occurrence of each element and uses a set to check for distinct elements in the queried range.
