Output State: **`p` is equal to the next value of `x` from `R()`, `j` is set to `i` if the next value of `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value, `a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` (which is the next value from `R()`) to `p`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `a`, or `i` directly. However, the condition for setting `j` to `i` if the next value of `x` is not equal to `p` will be evaluated in the next line of code. Since the next value of `x` is now assigned to `p`, the condition for setting `j` to `i` will depend on whether the next value of `x` is different from `p`. The values of `a` and `i` are updated based on the value of `j`, but since `j` is not yet determined, we keep it as described.
