Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is now the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2*10^5, `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into a tuple of integers.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    R()
    a = [0]
    p = i = j = 0
    for x in R():
        j = (j, i)[x != p]
        a += j,
        p = x
        i += 1
    q, = R()
    while q:
        q -= 1
        l, r = R()
        print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `q` is 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().

**Natural Language Explanation:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `q` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration and starts from a non-zero value that is reduced to 0 after 3 iterations. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last values returned by the function `R()` during the loop's final iteration.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` is `0`, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `q` is False, `l` is an element returned by `R()`, `r` is an element returned by `R()`, `t` is False, `a` is [1, (0, 1), 2, 3, 4, ...], `p` is the last element returned by `R()` during the loop execution, `i` is the total number of iterations performed by the loop, `j` is (i-1, i-1), `x` is an element returned by `R()`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `q` will eventually become `False` because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The value of `q` being `False` signifies that the condition `q` is no longer true, and thus the loop terminates. The values of `l`, `r`, `t`, `a`, `p`, `i`, `j`, and `x` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop as described in the output state after the loop executes 3 times. Since `q` is `False` and the loop has completed, these values do not change further.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
