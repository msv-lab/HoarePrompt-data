Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list containing the elements [0, 1, (j, i)[x != p]], `p` is the next value of `x` generated by `R()`, `i` is 3, `j` is (j, i)[x != p], `x` is equal to `p`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 2. After executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 3. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `j`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
