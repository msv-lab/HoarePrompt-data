Output State: **`q` is 0, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R(), `t` is False**

Explanation: The function `R()` is called, but its exact behavior is not specified (it returns a value). The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states because no assignment or modification to these variables is performed within the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions provided.
