Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list containing the single element 0, `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The given code `j = (j, i)[x != p]` uses a tuple unpacking condition. Since the value of `x` is not mentioned and `p` is 0, the expression `x != p` evaluates to `False` because `x` is not specified and defaults to 0, which is equal to `p`. Therefore, the tuple `(j, i)` is evaluated, and the first element `j` is assigned to `j` again, meaning `j` remains unchanged and is still 0. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `i`) remain in their initial state.
