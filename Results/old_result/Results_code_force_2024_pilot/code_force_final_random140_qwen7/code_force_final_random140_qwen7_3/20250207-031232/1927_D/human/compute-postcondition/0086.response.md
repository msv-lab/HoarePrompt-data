Output State: **`q` is 0, `l` must be an element returned by `R()`, `r` must be an element returned by `R()`, `t` is False, `a` is [1, (0, 1)], `p` is `R()`, `i` is 1, `j` is (0, 1)**

Explanation: The line `a += j,` updates the list `a` by adding the tuple `(0, 1)` to it. Initially, `a` is `[1]`. After the operation, `a` becomes `[1, (0, 1)]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
