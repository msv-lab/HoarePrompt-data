Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is 1 less than the original value returned by `R()`**.

Explanation: The code `R()` is called, which returns a value. Let's denote the value returned by `R()` as `original_value`. Before calling `R()`, `t` was defined as `original_value - 1`. After calling `R()`, `t` retains its previous value, which is `original_value - 1`. Therefore, `t` remains a non-zero value that is 1 less than the original value returned by `R()`.
