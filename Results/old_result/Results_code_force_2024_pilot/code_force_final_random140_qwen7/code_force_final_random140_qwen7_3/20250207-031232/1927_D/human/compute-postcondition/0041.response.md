Output State: **`q` is 0, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`, `t` is false**

Explanation: The code `R()` is called, but since no specific action or assignment is performed within the function call itself (other than potentially returning a value), the variables `q`, `l`, `r`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The function `R()` is called twice, but without any assignments or operations involving its return values, those return values are not stored or used, and thus the variables `l` and `r` retain their initial values returned by `R()`. The variable `t` remains `false` as no operation changes its value.
