Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2*10^5; `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into a tuple of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input from the user and splits it into a tuple of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This does not change the values of the existing variables but introduces a new lambda function `R`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged, and `R` is now defined as specified.
