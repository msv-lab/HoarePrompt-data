Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list containing the elements [0, 1], `p` is the next value provided by `R()`, `i` is 1, `j` is (0, 1)[x != p]**.

Explanation: The code `a += j` updates the list `a` by adding the elements of `j` to it. Initially, `a` is `[0, 0]`. Since `j` is `(0, 1)[x != p]`, `j` can either be `0` or `1` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`. After the addition, `a` becomes `[0, 0] + [1]` if `j` is `1`, or `[0, 0] + [0]` if `j` is `0`. Given the structure of `j`, the updated `a` will be `[0, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
