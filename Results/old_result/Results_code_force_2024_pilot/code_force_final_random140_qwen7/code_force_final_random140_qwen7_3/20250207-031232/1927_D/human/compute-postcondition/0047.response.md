Output State: **`p` is equal to `x`, `j` is set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value; `a` is increased by `j`.**

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the value of `x` to `p`. This does not affect the value of `j` or `a`. The condition for `j` being set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p` remains unchanged because `p` now equals `x`. Therefore, `j` will remain as its original value unless `x` changes in a way that it is no longer equal to `p`. The value of `a` is increased by `j`, but since `j` is not altered by the given code, the increase is based on the original value of `j`.
