Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` which is iterated over by the function `R()`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `x`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - The variable `x` is the only one that changes with each iteration of the loop.
   - The other variables (`p`, `j`, `a`, and `i`) are not directly controlled by the loop itself but rather by the loop body and initial conditions.

3. **Understand the loop body**:
   - `p` is initially set to `x`.
   - `j` is set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged.
   - `a` is increased by `j`.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is equal to `x`.
   - `j` is set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value.
   - `a` is increased by `j`.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

5. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` from the next iteration of `R()` must be considered.
   - Since `x` is the only variable that changes with each iteration, we need to update it for the next iteration.

Given the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`p` is equal to the next value of `x` from `R()`, `j` is set to `i` if the next value of `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value, `a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1**.
