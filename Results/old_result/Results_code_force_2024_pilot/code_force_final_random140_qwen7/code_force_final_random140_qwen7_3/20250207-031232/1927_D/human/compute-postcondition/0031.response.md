Output State: **`q` is a non-zero value - 1, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R()**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns the values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the function `R()` returns values, `l` and `r` now hold those returned values. The variable `q` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
