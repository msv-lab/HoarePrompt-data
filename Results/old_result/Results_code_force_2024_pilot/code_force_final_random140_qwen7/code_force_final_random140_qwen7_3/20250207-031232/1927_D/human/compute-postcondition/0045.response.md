Output State: **`j` is set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value.**

This means that the value of `j` will be updated based on the condition `x != p`. If `x` is not equal to `p`, then `j` will take the value of `i`. Otherwise, `j` retains its original value from the initial state.
