Output State: **`q` is equal to the value returned by `R()`, `j` is set to `i` if the last value of `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value; `a` is a list containing the sum of all `j` values added during each iteration, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations which is also the number of times `R()` was called, `p` is equal to the last value returned by `R()`, `j` is set to `i` if the last value of `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value, `a` is a list of all `j` values added during each iteration, `i` is the total number of iterations, `q` retains its initial value, `l` retains its initial value, `r` retains its initial value, `t` remains false.**

Explanation: The code `q, = R()` assigns the value returned by `R()` to `q`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
