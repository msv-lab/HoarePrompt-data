Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to find a pair of different elements within the queried range for certain inputs.

Consider the following example:

- Input:
```
5
2
1 2
1
1 2
```

- Expected Output:
```
1 2
```

- Actual Output:
```
-1 -1
```

The program incorrectly returns `-1 -1` because it does not properly track the indices of the elements within the queried range. The program uses a single index `i` to keep track of the last seen element's position, but it does not ensure that the indices `i` and `j` fall within the queried range `[l, r]`.

To fix this, the program needs to maintain a separate index for the start of the current subarray being considered and ensure that the indices `i` and `j` are within the bounds of the query. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    from collections import defaultdict

    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = next(R())
        a = list(R())
        q = next(R())
        queries = [tuple(R()) for _ in range(q)]

        results = []
        for l, r in queries:
            i, j = l, l
            found = False
            for k in range(l, r):
                if a[k] != a[i]:
                    j = k
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                results.append((i, j))
            else:
                results.append((-1, -1))

        for res in results:
            print(*res)
        if t > 0:
            print()  # Separate outputs for different test cases

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each query, it finds the first pair of different elements within the range `[l, r]` and prints their indices. If no such pair exists, it prints `-1 -1`.
