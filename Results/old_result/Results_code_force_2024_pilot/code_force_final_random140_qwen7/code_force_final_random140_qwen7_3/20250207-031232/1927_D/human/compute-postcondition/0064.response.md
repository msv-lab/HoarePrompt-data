Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is set to `q - 1`. This means `q` is one less than its original value.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`. Since `R()` is not specified, we assume it returns some value, say `x`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`. Again, since `R()` is not specified, we assume it returns some value, say `y`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `a[r]` refers to the element at index `r` in the list `a`. However, `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its value from the context.
   - The expression `[-1] * 2` creates a list with two `-1`s: `[-1, -1]`.
   - The condition `a[r] < l` checks if the element at index `r` in `a` is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, then the expression evaluates to `(-1, -1)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, then the expression evaluates to `[-1, -1]`.

Given that `a` is not explicitly defined, let's assume `a` is a list where `a[r]` can be any value. We need to consider both cases:

- **Case 1**: If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `(-1, -1)`.
- **Case 2**: If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `[-1, -1]`.

Since `a[r]` and `l` are not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact values. However, the print statement will output either `(-1, -1)` or `[-1, -1]` depending on the condition.

Output: **(-1, -1) or [-1, -1]**
