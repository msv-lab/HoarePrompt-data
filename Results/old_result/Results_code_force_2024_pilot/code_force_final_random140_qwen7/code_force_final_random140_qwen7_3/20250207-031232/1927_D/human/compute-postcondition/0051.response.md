Output State: **`p` is equal to the new value of `x`, `j` is set to `i` if the new `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value; `a` is increased by `j`.**

This means that `a` is incremented by the current value of `j`, which is either `i` (if the new value of `x` is not equal to `p`) or remains unchanged (if the new value of `x` is equal to `p`). The values of `p` and `j` remain as per their initial conditions unless the new value of `x` changes `p`.
