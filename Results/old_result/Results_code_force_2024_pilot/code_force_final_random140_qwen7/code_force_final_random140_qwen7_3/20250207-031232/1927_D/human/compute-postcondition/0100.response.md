Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is `False`.
   - `l` is an element returned by `R()`.
   - `r` is an element returned by `R()`.
   - `t` is `False`.
   - `a` is a list starting with `[1, (0, 1), 2, 3, 4, ...]`.
   - `p` is the last element returned by `R()` during the loop execution.
   - `i` is the total number of iterations performed by the loop.
   - `j` is `(i-1, i-1)`.
   - `x` is the current element returned by `R()` in the last iteration.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

   This print statement uses a conditional expression to decide between two tuples:
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, it prints the tuple `(a[r], r)`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the tuple `([-1] * 2)` which is `[-1, -1]`.

3. **Determine the Value of `a[r]`:**
   - `a` is a list starting with `[1, (0, 1), 2, 3, 4, ...]`.
   - `r` is an element returned by `R()`, but without knowing the exact value of `R()`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[r]`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition `a[r] < l`:**
   - Since `l` is an element returned by `R()`, it could be any value.
   - Without knowing the exact value of `a[r]` and `l`, we cannot definitively say whether `a[r] < l` is `True` or `False`.

Given the lack of specific values for `a[r]` and `l`, we need to consider both possible cases:

- If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the output will be `(a[r], r)`.
- If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the output will be `[-1, -1]`.

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact values, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the conditions provided.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise [-1, -1]**
