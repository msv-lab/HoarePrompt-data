Output State: **`p` is equal to the new value of `x`, `j` is set to `i` if the new `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value**.

Explanation: The code snippet `j = (j, i)[x != p]` uses a tuple unpacking technique to assign a value to `j`. This line checks if `x` is not equal to `p`. If `x` is not equal to `p`, then `j` is assigned the value of `i`. If `x` is equal to `p`, then `j` retains its original value. The initial conditions state that `p` is equal to the new value of `x`, so the condition `x != p` would only be true if the new value of `x` is different from `p`. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.
