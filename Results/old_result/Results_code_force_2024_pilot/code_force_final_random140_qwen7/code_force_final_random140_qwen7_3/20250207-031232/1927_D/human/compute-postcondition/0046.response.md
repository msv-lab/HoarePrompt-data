Output State: **`j` is set to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value; `a` is increased by `j`.**

Explanation: The code `a += j` increments the value of `a` by the current value of `j`. The value of `j` is determined by the condition `j = i if x != p else j`. Since the value of `j` does not change within the context of the given code snippet (it is either `i` or remains unchanged), `a` is increased by the value of `j`.
