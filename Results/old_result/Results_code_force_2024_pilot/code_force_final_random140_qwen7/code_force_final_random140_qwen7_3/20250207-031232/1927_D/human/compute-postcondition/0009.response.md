Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list containing the elements [0, 0], `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` increments the first element of the list `a` by the value of `j`. Since `a` initially contains `[0]` and `j` is 0, the first element of `a` becomes `0 + 0 = 0`. The list `a` now contains `[0, 0]`. The values of `t`, `p`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
