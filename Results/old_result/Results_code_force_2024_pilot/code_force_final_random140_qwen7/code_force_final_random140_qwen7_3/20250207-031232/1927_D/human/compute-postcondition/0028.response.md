Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is 0.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to determine its value within the context of the expression.
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` involves a conditional selection between two tuples.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the expression selects the tuple `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the expression selects the tuple `[-1] * 2`, which is `(-1, -1)`.

4. **Determining the Value of `a`:**
   - Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we need to infer its value from the context.
   - Typically, `a` could be a list where `a[r]` refers to an element in the list at index `r`.

5. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `(-1, -1)`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the selected tuple into separate arguments for the `print` function.
   - Therefore, the output will be either `(a[r], r)` if `a[r] < l` is `True`, or `(-1, -1)` if `a[r] < l` is `False`.

Given the initial state and the lack of explicit definition for `a`, we cannot determine the exact values of `a[r]` and `l`. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the conditions.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise (-1, -1)**
