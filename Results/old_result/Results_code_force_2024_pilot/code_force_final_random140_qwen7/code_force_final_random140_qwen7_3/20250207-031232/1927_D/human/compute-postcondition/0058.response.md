Output State: **`p` is equal to the next value of `x` from `R()`, `j` is set to `i` if the next value of `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` remains as its original value, `a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`p`, `j`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being increased by 1 while keeping the conditions and values of `p`, `j`, and `a` as they were initially described.
