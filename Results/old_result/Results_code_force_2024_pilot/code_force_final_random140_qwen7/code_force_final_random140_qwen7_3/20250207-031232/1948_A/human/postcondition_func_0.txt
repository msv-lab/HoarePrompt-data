The function accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 50 (inclusive) and prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string `res` consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'. After constructing the string, it prints `res`. The final state of the program includes `i` being 50, `n` being 0, `letter` being 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `res` being a string of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.
