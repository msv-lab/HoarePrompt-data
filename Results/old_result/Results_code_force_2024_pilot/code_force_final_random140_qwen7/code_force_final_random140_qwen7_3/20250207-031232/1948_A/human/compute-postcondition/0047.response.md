Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `t` is the same, `n` is an integer input from the user, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to an empty string and `x` to 0. The values of `i`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. `j` is defined as `n // 2 - 1`, but since `n` is an integer input from the user, its value is not specified here.
