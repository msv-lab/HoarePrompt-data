Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive and greater than 1; `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'; `res` is 'B'**

Explanation: The code `res += letter[i % 26]` updates the value of `res`. Given that `i` is 2, `i % 26` will be 2 because 2 divided by 26 leaves a remainder of 2. Since `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', the character at index 2 is 'B'. Therefore, `res` is updated to 'A' (its original value) concatenated with 'B', resulting in 'AB'. However, since the initial value of `res` is specified as either 'A' or 'AA', and adding 'B' to 'A' results in 'AB', which is not one of the initial options, we conclude that the initial value of `res` must have been 'A' to match the output 'AB'. Thus, `res` is 'B'. All other variables remain unchanged.
