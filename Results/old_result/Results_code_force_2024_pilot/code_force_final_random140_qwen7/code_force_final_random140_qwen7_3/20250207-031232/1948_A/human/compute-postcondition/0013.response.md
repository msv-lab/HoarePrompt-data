Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is 'A', and `n` is less than 2.**

Explanation: The code `res += letter[i % 26]` appends the character from `letter` at index `i % 26` to the string `res`. Since `i` is initially 0, `i % 26` is 0, and the first character of `letter` (which is 'A') is appended to `res`. After this operation, `i` increments by 1, so `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
