Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive and greater than 1; `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'; `res` is 'AAAA'**

Explanation: The code `res += letter[i % 26] * 2` updates the variable `res`. Since `i` is 2, `i % 26` is 2 (because 2 modulo 26 is 2). The character at index 2 in `letter` is 'C'. Therefore, `letter[i % 26]` is 'C', and `letter[i % 26] * 2` is 'CC'. Adding 'CC' to `res` (which initially is 'A' or 'AA') results in 'AAAA'. All other variables remain unchanged.
