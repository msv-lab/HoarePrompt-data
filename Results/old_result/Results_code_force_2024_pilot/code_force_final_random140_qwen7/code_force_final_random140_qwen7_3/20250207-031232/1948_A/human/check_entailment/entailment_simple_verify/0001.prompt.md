You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0

            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 50, `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is a string consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it appends 'AA' to `res` and decreases `n` by 2. If `n` is 1, it appends 'A' to `res` and decreases `n` by 1. The variable `i` increments by 1 in each iteration. Given that `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, after 50 iterations, `i` will be 50. Since `n` starts as an integer between 2 and 50 and decreases by 2 or 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, `n` will be 0 after 50 iterations. The string `res` will consist of 49 repetitions of 'AA' because in each full iteration (where `n` is 2), 'AA' is appended to `res`.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: AAAAAAA...AAAAAA (49 repetitions of 'AA')
    #State: `i` is 50, `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is a string consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 2.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` must be greater than 2. This is because the loop runs `t` times, and for it to run at least 3 times, `t` must initially be greater than 2. If `t` were 2 or less, the loop would not complete all its iterations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
3. **Special Character Generation**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the function prints "YES".
   - It initializes a string `letter` containing all uppercase Latin letters.
   - A variable `i` is used to cycle through the letters.
   - A result string `res` is initialized to store the generated string.
   - A loop runs until `n` becomes 0:
     - If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it appends two consecutive letters from `letter` to `res` and decreases `n` by 2.
     - If `n` is exactly 1, it appends one letter from `letter` to `res` and decreases `n` by 1.
4. **Output**: The function prints the result string `res`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - For `n <= 1`, the function correctly prints "NO", which matches the requirement to report "NO" if there is no suitable string.

2. **Special Character Generation**:
   - The function generates a string where every pair of consecutive characters is different, ensuring that each character is special (appears exactly once among its neighbors).
   - The loop ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is within the constraints.

3. **Output Format**:
   - For strings with more than one special character, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string.
   - For strings with exactly one special character or none, it prints "NO".

### Example Verification

- **Input**: 
  ```
  3
  6
  1
  2
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  AAABAACC
  NO
  YES
  MM
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  - For `n = 6`: The output "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8), which is correct.
  - For `n = 1`: The output "NO" is correct since it's impossible to have exactly one special character.
  - For `n = 2`: The output "MM" has 2 special characters (positions 1 and 2), which is correct.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a string with the specified number of special characters or report that no such string exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
