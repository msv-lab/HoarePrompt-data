Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input.
   - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".
   - It initializes a string `res` to store the result.
   - It uses a loop to construct the result string:
     - If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it appends two consecutive characters from the alphabet to `res` and decrements `n` by 2.
     - If `n` is 1, it appends one character from the alphabet to `res` and decrements `n` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed string `res`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Case when `n <= 1`**:
   - According to the problem statement, if `n` is 1 or less, the output should be "NO".
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles this case by printing "NO".

2. **Case when `n > 1`**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs a string where every pair of consecutive characters is different, ensuring that each character is special (i.e., it is different from its neighbors).
   - The construction process ensures that the string length is at most 200, which is within the constraints.
   - The function `func_1` correctly prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Examples

- **Example 1**: `n = 6`
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    YES
    AAABAACC
    ```
  - Explanation: The string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters (A, A, B, A, A, C, C).

- **Example 2**: `n = 1`
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    NO
    ```
  - Explanation: There is no way to have exactly 1 special character in a string.

- **Example 3**: `n = 2`
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    YES
    MM
    ```
  - Explanation: The string "MM" has 2 special characters (M, M).

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for all given constraints and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
