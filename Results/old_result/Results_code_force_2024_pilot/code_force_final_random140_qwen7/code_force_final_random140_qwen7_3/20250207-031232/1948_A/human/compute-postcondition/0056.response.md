Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `j`, and the loop iterates over `range(n // 2)`. This means `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n // 2`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 2.
   - `x` is increased by 1.
   - `ans` is updated by adding `s[x] * 2` to `ans`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, the loop will execute one more time if `j < n // 2`.
   - After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 3.
   - `x` will be increased by 1 again.
   - `ans` will be updated by adding `s[x] * 2` to its current value.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be 3.
   - `x` will be increased by 1, so if `x` was previously `x_val`, it will now be `x_val + 1`.
   - `ans` will be updated by adding `s[x] * 2` to its current value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 3, `x` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans + s[x] * 2`**
