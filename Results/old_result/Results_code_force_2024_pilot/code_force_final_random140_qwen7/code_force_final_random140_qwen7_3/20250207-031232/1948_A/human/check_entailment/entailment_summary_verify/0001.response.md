### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program correctly implements the logic to generate a string with the specified number of special characters or report that no such string exists. However, upon closer inspection, we need to verify if the program indeed meets all the requirements and edge cases.

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - For `n <= 1`, the function correctly prints "NO".

2. **Special Character Generation**:
   - The function generates a string where every pair of consecutive characters is different, ensuring that each character is special (appears exactly once among its neighbors).
   - The loop ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is within the constraints.

3. **Output Format**:
   - For strings with more than one special character, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string.
   - For strings with exactly one special character or none, it prints "NO".

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the special character generation logic. The function always generates pairs of consecutive characters, which means that the generated string will always have even lengths. This violates the requirement that the string can have an odd length and still meet the criteria of having exactly `n` special characters.

### Example Counterexample

Consider the case when `n = 3`. According to the problem statement, a valid string could be "ABAC" where the special characters are at positions 2 and 4. However, the current implementation will generate a string like "AAABAACC" which has a length of 8, and it will not produce a string of length 4.

### Corrected Implementation

To fix this, we need to ensure that the function can handle both even and odd lengths. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if n <= 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                if n == 1:
                    res += letter[i % 26]
                    n -= 1
                elif n == 2:
                    res += letter[(i + 1) % 26]
                    n -= 2
            i += 1
        # Ensure the string length is at most 200
        if len(res) > 200:
            res = res[:200]
        print(res)
```

### Final Evaluation

Given the above analysis, the original program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is odd. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
