Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive and greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is 'A'**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by 1, so `n` is now one less than its original value, which was an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and greater than 1. It is now an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive and greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
