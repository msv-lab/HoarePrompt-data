Output State: `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `x` is `n`, `ans` is the concatenation of `s[x] * 2` for each `x` from `0` to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n // 2 - 1`, `x` will be equal to `n`, and `ans` will contain the result of appending `s[x] * 2` for each value of `x` starting from `0` up to `n-1`.
