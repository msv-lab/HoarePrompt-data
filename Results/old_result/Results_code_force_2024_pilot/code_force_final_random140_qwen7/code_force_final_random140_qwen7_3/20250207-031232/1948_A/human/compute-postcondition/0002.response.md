Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no information about what `func_1()` does is provided, the only thing we can conclude is that the call to `func_1()` itself does not change the value of `t`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
