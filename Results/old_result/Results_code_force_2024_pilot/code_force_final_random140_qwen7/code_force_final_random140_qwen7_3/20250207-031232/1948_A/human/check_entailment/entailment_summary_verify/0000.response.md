### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - We need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters.
   - A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The program should handle both even and odd values of `n`.
   - If no such string exists, it should print "NO".
   - Otherwise, it should print "YES" followed by a valid string of length at most 200.

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_1` handles a single test case. It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1 and prints "NO" if true. Otherwise, it constructs a string with `n` special characters and prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.
   - `func_2` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case. It ensures that `t` (number of test cases) is greater than 2 after processing.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies when `n` is 1 or less and prints "NO".
   - For `n > 1`, it constructs a string with pairs of characters from the alphabet, ensuring that each pair has exactly one special character (the second character in the pair).
   - This approach works for even `n` but fails for odd `n`. As noted in the original assessment, for odd `n`, it is impossible to construct a string where every character is special because there will always be one character without a pair.

4. **Example Scenarios**:
   - For `n = 6`, the constructed string "AAABAACC" is correct as it has 6 special characters.
   - For `n = 1`, the function correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have 1 special character.
   - For `n = 3`, the function incorrectly prints "YES" and a string like "AAAB" or "AB", which does not meet the requirement of having exactly 3 special characters.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. It prints "YES" and a constructed string for odd `n`, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where `n` is odd, as explained in the original assessment.
