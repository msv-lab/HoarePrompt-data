Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive and greater than 0; `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'; `res` is 'B'**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by 1, making it one less than its original value while still being an integer between 1 and 49 (exclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
