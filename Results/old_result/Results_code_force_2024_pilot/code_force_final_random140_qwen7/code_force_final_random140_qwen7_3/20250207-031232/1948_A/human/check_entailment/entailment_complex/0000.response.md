Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- For `n = 1`, the function correctly prints "NO" since it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
- For `n > 1`, the function constructs a string with `n` special characters:
  - It uses a loop to append pairs of the same character ('AA') until `n` becomes 1.
  - When `n` is 1, it appends a single character ('A').
  - This ensures that every 'A' in the constructed string is a special character, as it is surrounded by different characters ('A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'A').

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the value of `n`.
- The function correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

### Overall Program Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the edge case when `n = 1` by printing "NO".
- For other values of `n`, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters.
- The program outputs "YES" followed by the constructed string or "NO" as required.

Given the analysis, the provided program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
