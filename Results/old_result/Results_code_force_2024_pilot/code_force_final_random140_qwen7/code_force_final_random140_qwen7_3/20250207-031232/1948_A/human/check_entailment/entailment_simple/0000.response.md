Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly handles the problem statement requirements.
- The `func_1` function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters.
- The construction logic in `func_1` ensures that every pair of adjacent characters in the constructed string is different, making each character special. For even `n`, it appends 'AA' repeatedly, and for odd `n`, it appends 'A' once more.
- The `func_2` function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The provided comments accurately describe the state of the program and the output for each function.
- The program does not need to use the `MOD` constant defined at the beginning since it is not used anywhere in the code.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
