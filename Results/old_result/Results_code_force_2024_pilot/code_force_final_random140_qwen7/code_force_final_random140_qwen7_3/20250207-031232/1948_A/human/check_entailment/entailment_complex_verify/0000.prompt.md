You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO

                n -= 2
            else:

        #State: Output State: `i` is 50, `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is a string consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it appends 'AA' to `res` and decreases `n` by 2. If `n` is 1, it appends 'A' to `res` and decreases `n` by 1. The variable `i` increments by 1 in each iteration. Given that `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, after 50 iterations, `i` will be 50. Since `n` starts as an integer between 2 and 50 and decreases by 2 or 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, `n` will be 0 after 50 iterations. The string `res` will consist of 49 repetitions of 'AA' because in each full iteration (where `n` is 2), 'AA' is appended to `res`.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: AAAAAAA...AAAAAA (49 repetitions of 'AA')
    #State: `i` is 50, `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is a string consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 50 (inclusive) and prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string `res` consisting of 49 repetitions of 'AA'. After constructing the string, it prints `res`. The final state of the program includes `i` being 50, `n` being 0, `letter` being 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `res` being a string of 49 repetitions of 'AA'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 2.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` must be greater than 2. This is because the loop runs `t` times, and for it to run at least 3 times, `t` must initially be greater than 2. If `t` were 2 or less, the loop would not complete all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It then executes a loop `t` times, running the `func_1()` function for each iteration. After the loop completes, the value of `t` must be greater than 2, ensuring that at least three test cases were processed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. According to the problem description, a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For `n` being odd, it is impossible to construct a string where every character is special because there will always be one character without a pair to satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one neighbor. However, the provided solution does not account for this scenario and prints 'YES' and a constructed string for odd `n`, which is incorrect.

For example, if `n = 3`, the program will generate a string like "AAAB" or "AB", but none of these strings can have all characters as special. Therefore, the program should print "NO" for odd `n`.
