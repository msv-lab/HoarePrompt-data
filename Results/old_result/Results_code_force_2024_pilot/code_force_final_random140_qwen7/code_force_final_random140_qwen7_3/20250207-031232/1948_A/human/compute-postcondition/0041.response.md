Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of `s[x + 1]` repeated `n // 2` times.

Given these conditions, let's break down the values:

1. Since `n` must be at least 3, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 3.
2. If `n = 3`, then `j = n // 2 - 1 = 3 // 2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`.
3. `ans` is the sum of `s[x + 1]` repeated `n // 2` times. Since `n // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1` (integer division), `ans` will be the string `s[x + 1]` repeated once.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
