Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints, the function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The description of the output does not specify any particular return value or behavior, only constraints on `t` and `n`. Since these constraints are related to the parameters but `func_2` itself does not accept any parameters, it implies that the function might be used within a context where `t` and `n` are predefined or passed through other means, and the function itself does not return anything based on the given information.
