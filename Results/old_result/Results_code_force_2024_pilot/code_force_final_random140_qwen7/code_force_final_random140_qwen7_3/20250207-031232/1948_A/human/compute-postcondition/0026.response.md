The loop condition is `n > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive and greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive and must still be greater than 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `res` is either 'AAAA' or 'B'**
