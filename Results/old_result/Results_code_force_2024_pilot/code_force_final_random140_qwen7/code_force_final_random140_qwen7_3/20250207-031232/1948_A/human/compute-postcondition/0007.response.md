Output State: `t` must be greater than 2.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` must be greater than 2. This is because the loop runs as long as `t` is greater than 0, and after executing 3 times, `t` must be greater than 1. Following this logic, if the loop can run 3 times, `t` must initially have been greater than 2 to allow for those 3 iterations.
