Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between -1 and 46 inclusive and must still be greater than -1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `res` is 'BBAA'**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by 2. Since `n` was initially an integer between 0 and 48 (inclusive) and must still be greater than 0, after decrementing by 2, `n` will now be an integer between -1 and 46 (inclusive) and must still be greater than -1. The values of `i`, `letter`, and `res` remain unchanged.
