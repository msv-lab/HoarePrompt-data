Reasoning:
- The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is intended to handle a single test case by checking if `n` is 1 (in which case it prints "NO" since it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of length up to 200), and for other values of `n`, it constructs a string with the required properties.
- `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` for each test case.

However, upon closer inspection, `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the constructed string has exactly `n` special characters. Instead, it constructs a string with repeated 'A's, which does not satisfy the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to construct a string where the number of special characters is exactly `n`. Here's a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if n <= 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        # Construct a string with exactly n special characters
        res = 'A' * (n - 1) + 'B'
        print(res)
```

With this corrected `func_1`, `func_2` will correctly handle each test case by constructing a string with the required number of special characters.

Given the current implementation of `func_1`, it does not meet the problem requirements, so the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
