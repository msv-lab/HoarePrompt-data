Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `s[x + 1]` repeated `n // 2` times.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` should be at least 3 (since the loop runs `n // 2` times, and `n` needs to be at least 3 to run 1.5 iterations, which rounds up to 2 full iterations), `j` will be `n // 2 - 1` (as it increments by 1 each iteration), and `ans` will be a string where each character is `s[x + 1]` repeated `n // 2` times.
