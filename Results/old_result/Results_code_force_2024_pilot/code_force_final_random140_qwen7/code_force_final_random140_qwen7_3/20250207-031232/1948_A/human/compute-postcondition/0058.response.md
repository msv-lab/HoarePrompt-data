Output State: **`j` is 3, `x` is 4, `ans` is `ans + s[4] * 2`**

Explanation: Initially, `j` is 3, `x` is increased by 1 (so `x` becomes 4), and `ans` is `ans + s[x] * 2`. After executing `x += 1`, the value of `x` is incremented by 1, making it 4. The other variables remain unchanged, so `j` is still 3 and `ans` is updated to `ans + s[4] * 2`.
