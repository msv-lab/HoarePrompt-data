Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), the input must also satisfy this condition. Therefore, `t` is now an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
