To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `a1 <= a2`.

Let's break down the relevant parts:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `a1 <= a2`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop condition are `a1` and `a2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `a1 <= a2` must still hold true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` at the start of the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `b1` is either 0 or 1.
- `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`.
- `dif2` is either `abs(a[a1 + 1] - b[b2 - 1])` or `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`.
- `dif3` is either `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])` or `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`.
- `dif4` is either `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])` or `abs(a[a2] - b[b2 - 1])`.
- `ans` is updated based on comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`.
- `a1` and `a2` are adjusted accordingly.

Since the loop condition only depends on `a1` and `a2`, we need to ensure that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a1` and `a2` such that `a1 <= a2`.

**State:**
**`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is either `abs(a[a1 + 1] - b[b2 - 1])` or `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is either `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])` or `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is either `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])` or `abs(a[a2] - b[b2 - 1])`; `ans` is updated such that if `dif1 > dif2`, `ans` is updated according to whether `dif3 > dif4`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `max(dif3, dif2)` if `dif3 > dif4` is true, otherwise it is increased by either `dif4` or `dif2` depending on the condition `dif4 > dif2`, and `a1` and `a2` are adjusted accordingly; `a1` and `a2` must satisfy `a1 <= a2` for the next iteration.**
