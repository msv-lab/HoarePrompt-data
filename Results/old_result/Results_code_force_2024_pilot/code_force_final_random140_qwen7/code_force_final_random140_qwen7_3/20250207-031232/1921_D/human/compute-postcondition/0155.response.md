Postcondition: `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, then `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and the variables `a2` and `b2` are each decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `dif2`, and the variables `a1` and `b2` are adjusted accordingly (i.e., `a1` is incremented by 1 and `b2` is decremented by 1). The absolute differences `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are also updated according to their respective definitions within each branch of the if-else statement.
