Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]` to `dif4`. Since `a2` can be either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `a[a2]` will be either `a[n-2]` or `a[n-1]`. However, the exact value of `a[a2]` and `b[b2]` is not specified, so `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
