Output State: **`a1` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `dif2` as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` (which is `a[0]` since `a1` is 0) and `b[b2]` (which is `b[m - 1]`). Since `a` and `b` are not modified, their states remain unchanged. The other variables also remain unchanged except for `dif2`, which is now set to the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the element at index `m - 1` in `b`.
