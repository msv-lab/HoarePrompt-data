Postcondition: `b1` is either 0 or 1, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is updated such that if `dif3 > dif1`, then `ans` is `ans + dif3`, otherwise `ans` is `ans + dif1`, and `a1` is incremented by 1 if the else part is executed.
