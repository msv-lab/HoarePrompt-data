Output State: **`a1` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `b1` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `b2` is `m - 1`.**

The code `b2 = m - 1` updates the value of `b2` to `m - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
