Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` must be at least `n - 3`, `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is `ans + dif2`, `b2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decreases the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
