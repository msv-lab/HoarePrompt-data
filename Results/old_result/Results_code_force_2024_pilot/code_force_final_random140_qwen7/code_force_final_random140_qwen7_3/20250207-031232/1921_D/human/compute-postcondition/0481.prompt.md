Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a1` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `b1` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `a` is sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 1`, `ans` is either `dif2` or `dif3`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b2])`, and `b1` is increased by 1 if `dif3 > dif4`, otherwise `b1` remains the same. If `a2` is `n - 2`, then `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, and `ans` is `dif4`; otherwise, `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`, and `ans` is `dif2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is either `n - 3`, `n - 2`, or `n - 1`, `b1` is incremented by 1 if `a1` is 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2 - 1]` or `b[b2]` depending on the value of `a2`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `dif3` (when `a2` is `n - 2`) and `dif2` (when `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 3`), and `b1` is incremented by 1 if `a1` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is at least `n - 3`, `b1` and `b2` are updated based on the value of `a1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated according to the conditions inside the if and else blocks, and `ans` is updated as follows:
- If `dif3 > dif1` and `a1` is 1, then `ans` is updated to `ans + dif3` and `b1` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif1` and `b1` is increased by 1.
- If `a2` is greater than or equal to `n - 3`, `a2` is decreased by 1 and `b1` is increased by 1 if `a1` is 1.
- `dif3` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])` and `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.

- If `dif3 > dif2`, then `ans` is `ans + dif3`; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + dif2` (with `b2` decreased by 1 if `dif3 > dif2`).
- If `dif4 > dif2`, then `ans` is `ans + dif4`; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + dif2` (with `b2` decreased by 1 if `dif4 > dif2`).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
