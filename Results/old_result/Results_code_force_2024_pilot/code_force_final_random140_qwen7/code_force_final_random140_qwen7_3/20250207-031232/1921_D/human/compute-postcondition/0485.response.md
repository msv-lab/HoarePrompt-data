Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. For each test case, it checks if t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and if n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, with the sum of m not exceeding 2 × 10^5 across all test cases. Additionally, it verifies that a_i and b_i are integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The function does not return any specific value but rather validates the input constraints for each test case.**
