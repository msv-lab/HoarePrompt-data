Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif4`**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif4` increments the value of `ans` by `dif4`. Since `dif4` is defined as `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is updated to its current value plus `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`. All other variables (`b1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `b2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
