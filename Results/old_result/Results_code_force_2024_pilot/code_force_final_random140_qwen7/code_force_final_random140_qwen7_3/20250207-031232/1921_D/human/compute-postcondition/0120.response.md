Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]` to `dif2`. The value of `dif1` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
