Postcondition: **`b1` is 1 if `dif3 > dif2`, otherwise `b1` is 0. `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`. `t` is a positive integer less than its original value. `n` and `m` are input integers. `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. `a1` and `a2` are indices within the range of `a`. `b2` is an index within the range of `b`. `ans` is either `dif2` or `dif3` depending on the condition. `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`. `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`. `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[b2]`. The condition `dif3 > dif2` holds when `b1` is 1, and `dif3 <= dif2` holds when `b1` is 0.**
