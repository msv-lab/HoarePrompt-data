Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second input to `m`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on `t`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated variables `n` and `m` along with the unchanged condition of `t`.
