Postcondition: **`ans` is updated based on the condition `dif4 > dif1`. If `dif4 > dif1`, then `ans` is set to `dif4`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged, and the other variables (`b1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b2`) retain their respective states as described in the else part.**
