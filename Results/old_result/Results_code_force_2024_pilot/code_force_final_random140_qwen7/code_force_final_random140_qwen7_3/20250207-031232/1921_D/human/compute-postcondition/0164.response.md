Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is 0, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences found during each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It does not affect the values of `b1`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b2`, or `ans`. The initial conditions for `n` and `m` are that they are input integers, which means their exact values are not known until the input is provided. The other variables remain unchanged.
