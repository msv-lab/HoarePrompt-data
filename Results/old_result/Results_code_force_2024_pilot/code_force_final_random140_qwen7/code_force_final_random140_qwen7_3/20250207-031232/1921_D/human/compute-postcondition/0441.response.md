Output State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` must be at least `n - 3`; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is not updated; `dif3` is not updated; `dif4` is not updated; `ans` is not updated; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `dif1` as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. Since `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a[a1]` will be either `a[0]` or `a[1]`. The value of `b1` is incremented by 1 if `a1` is 1. Other variables (`a2`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
