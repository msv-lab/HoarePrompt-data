Postcondition: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `dif1 > dif2`, then if `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is increased by `dif3` by 1; otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4` to its current value. If `dif4 > dif2`, then `b2` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `b1` is either 1 or 2. If `dif1 <= dif2`, then if `dif3 > dif2`, `ans` is updated by adding `dif3` to its current value; otherwise, if `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4` to its current value, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` is incremented by 1 while still being less than or equal to `a2`.**
