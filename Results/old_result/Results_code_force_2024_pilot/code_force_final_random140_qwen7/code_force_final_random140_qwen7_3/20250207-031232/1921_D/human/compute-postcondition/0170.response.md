Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value of `m - 1` to `b2`. The values of `b1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `a1`, `a2`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
