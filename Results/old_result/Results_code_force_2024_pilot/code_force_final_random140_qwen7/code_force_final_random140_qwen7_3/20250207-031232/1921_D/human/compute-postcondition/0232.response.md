Output State: **`b1` is 0; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b2` is `m - 1`; `b` is a list of integers; `ans` is `dif2`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[m-1]`; additionally, `dif4` is less than or equal to `dif2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif2` increments the value of `ans` by `dif2`. Since `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`, `ans` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
