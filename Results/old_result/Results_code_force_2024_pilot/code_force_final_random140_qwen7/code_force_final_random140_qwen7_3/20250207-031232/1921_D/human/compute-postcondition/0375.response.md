Output State: **`a1` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif2`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, and `dif3` is not greater than `dif2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif2` adds the value of `dif2` to `ans`. Since `dif2` is defined as `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, the new value of `ans` is now `dif2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
