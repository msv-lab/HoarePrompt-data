Output State: **`ans` is `dif1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b1+1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` now involve `b1+1` instead of `b1`.
