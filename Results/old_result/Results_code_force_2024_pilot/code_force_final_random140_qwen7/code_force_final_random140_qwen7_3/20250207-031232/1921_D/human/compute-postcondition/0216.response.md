Output State: **`b1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 2`; `b2` is `m - 1`; `b` is a list of integers; `ans` is `dif3`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[m-1]`; `dif1` is less than or equal to `dif2`.**

Explanation: The line `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. Since `b1` was initially 0, after executing this line, `b1` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
