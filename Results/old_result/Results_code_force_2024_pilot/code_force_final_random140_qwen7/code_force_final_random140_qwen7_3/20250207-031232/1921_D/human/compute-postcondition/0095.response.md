Postcondition: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is updated by adding either `dif4` (if `dif4 > dif1`) or `dif1` (if `dif4 <= dif1`); `a2` is decreased by 1 if `dif4 > dif1`; `a1` is increased by 1 if `dif4 <= dif1`.**
