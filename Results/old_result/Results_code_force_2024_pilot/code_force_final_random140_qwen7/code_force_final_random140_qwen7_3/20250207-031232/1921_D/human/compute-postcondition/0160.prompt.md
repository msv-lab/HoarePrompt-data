Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b1` is 0, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b1` is either 0 or 1, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `b2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 1`, `ans` is updated as follows: if `dif1 > dif2`, then `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif3` if `dif3 > dif1` and `ans + dif1` otherwise; otherwise, `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is set to `dif3`; otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif4` if `dif4 > dif2`, or `ans` remains unchanged if `dif4 <= dif2`. `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, and `a` and `b` remain lists of integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is either `abs(a[a1 + 1] - b[b2 - 1])` or `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is either `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])` or `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is either `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])` or `abs(a[a2] - b[b2 - 1])`; `ans` is updated such that if `dif1 > dif2`, `ans` is updated according to whether `dif3 > dif4`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `max(dif3, dif2)` if `dif3 > dif4` is true, otherwise it is increased by either `dif4` or `dif2` depending on the condition `dif4 > dif2`, and `a1` and `a2` are adjusted accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` represent the absolute differences as defined. `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, then `a2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by `dif3`, and `b1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`. If `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, then `a2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by `dif4`, and the differences are recalculated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and the differences are recalculated with `a1+1` and `b1+1`. If `dif1` is not greater than `dif2`, then `ans` is updated based on the minimum of `dif3` and `dif2 + dif2`, and the variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a2`, and `b2` are updated accordingly (i.e., `a2` is decreased by 1 and `b2` is decreased by 1).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
