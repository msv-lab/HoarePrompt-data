Output State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` must be at least `n - 3`; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is not updated; `dif4` is not updated; `ans` is not updated; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `dif2` to be the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`. Since `b2` is not defined before this line, it remains unchanged from its previous state. All other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.
