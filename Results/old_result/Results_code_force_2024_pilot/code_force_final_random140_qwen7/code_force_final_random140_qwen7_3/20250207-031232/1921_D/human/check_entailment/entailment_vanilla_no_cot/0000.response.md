Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Choosing Elements**: The logic used to decide which elements to pick from `b` to maximize the difference is flawed. It doesn't always ensure the maximum possible difference. For instance, the conditions like `if dif1 > dif2:` and subsequent checks don't guarantee the optimal choice of elements.

2. **Sorting and Index Management**: While sorting `b` helps, the way indices `b1` and `b2` are managed and updated might not always lead to the optimal solution. The current approach does not consider all possible permutations of picking elements from `b` to maximize the differences.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: There are edge cases where the current logic might fail to produce the correct result. For example, when the arrays `a` and `b` have specific values that require a different strategy to maximize the differences.

A more effective approach would involve using a greedy algorithm combined with a min-heap to efficiently manage the smallest and largest elements in `b` and compare them with the corresponding elements in `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Use heaps to keep track of the smallest and largest elements in b
        min_heap = []
        max_heap = []
        for num in b:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -num)

        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            # Get the smallest and largest elements from b
            min_b = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            max_b = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)

            # Calculate the differences
            diff1 = abs(a[i] - min_b)
            diff2 = abs(a[i] - max_b)

            # Add the larger difference to the answer
            ans += max(diff1, diff2)

        print(ans)

func()
```

This solution uses heaps to efficiently get the smallest and largest elements from `b` and calculates the differences accordingly, ensuring the maximum possible total difference.
