Postcondition: `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `dif4 > dif2`, then `ans` is incremented by `dif4`; otherwise, `b2` is set to `m - 2`. `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, and `a` and `b` remain lists of integers sorted in ascending order. `b1` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, and `b2` is either `m - 2` or remains unchanged.
