Postcondition: **`b1` is 1, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition, `a2` is `n - 2` if `dif3 > dif1` and `n - 1` otherwise, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif3` if `dif3 > dif1` and `ans + dif1` otherwise, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `b1` is set to 1, `t` is decremented by 1, and `n` remains greater than or equal to 1. The lists `a` and `b` remain sorted in ascending order. The variables `a1`, `a2`, `b2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their original values. The variable `ans` is updated based on whether `dif3` is greater than `dif1` or not. If `dif3` is greater, `ans` is set to `dif3`; otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`.
