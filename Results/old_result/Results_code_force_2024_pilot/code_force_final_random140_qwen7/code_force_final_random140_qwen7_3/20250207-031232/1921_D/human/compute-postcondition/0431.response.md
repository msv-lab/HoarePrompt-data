Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans` plus `dif2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif2` adds the value of `dif2` to `ans`. Since `dif2` is defined as the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` now includes this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
