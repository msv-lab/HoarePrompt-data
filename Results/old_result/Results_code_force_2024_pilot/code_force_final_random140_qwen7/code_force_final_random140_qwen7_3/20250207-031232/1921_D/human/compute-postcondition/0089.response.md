Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif4`**

The variable `ans` is incremented by `dif4`, which is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
