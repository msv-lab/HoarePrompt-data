Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `b2` is an index within the range of `b`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop, with the loop terminating when `a1` exceeds `a2`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
