Postcondition: `ans` is updated based on the comparison of `dif4` and `dif2`. If `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, `ans` is incremented by `dif4`. Otherwise, `b2` is set to `m - 2`, and the differences `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. `a` and `b` are lists of integers sorted in ascending order, `b1` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, and `b2` is `m - 2`.
