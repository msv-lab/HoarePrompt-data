Postcondition: `b1` is 1, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `dif3` and `dif1` if `dif3 > dif1`, otherwise `ans` is `ans + dif1`.
