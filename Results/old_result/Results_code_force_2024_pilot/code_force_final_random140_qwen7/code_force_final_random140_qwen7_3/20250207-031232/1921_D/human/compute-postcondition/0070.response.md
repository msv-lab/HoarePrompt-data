Output State: **`b2` is `m - 2`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, and `dif4` is not greater than `dif2`.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. Initially, `b2` was `m - 1`. After decrementing, `b2` becomes `m - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
