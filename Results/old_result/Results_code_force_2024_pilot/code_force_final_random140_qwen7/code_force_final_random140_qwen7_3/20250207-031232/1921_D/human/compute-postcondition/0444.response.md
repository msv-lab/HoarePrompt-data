Output State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` must be at least `n - 3`; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is not updated.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `dif4` to be the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
