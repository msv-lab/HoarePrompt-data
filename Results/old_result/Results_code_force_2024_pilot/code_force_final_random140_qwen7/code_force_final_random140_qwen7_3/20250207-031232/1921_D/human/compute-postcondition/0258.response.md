Postcondition: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is increased by either `dif1` or `dif4` based on the condition `dif3 > dif1` or `dif3 > dif4` respectively.**
