Postcondition: **`a1` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b1` is `b1 + 1` or remains the same, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif4` or `dif1`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`. The final value of `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`.**
