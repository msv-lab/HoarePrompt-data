Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is `b1 + 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif3`.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `b1` is updated to `b1 + 1`, while `a1`, `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `ans`, and `n` retain their original values.
