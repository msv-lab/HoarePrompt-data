Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `n - 1` to `a2`. Since `n` is an input integer, `a2` is now `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
