Postcondition: **`b1` is either 1 or 2, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `b2` is an index within the range of `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2]`, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `dif3 > dif1`, then `ans` is increased by `dif3` by 1; otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `dif1` to its current value.**
