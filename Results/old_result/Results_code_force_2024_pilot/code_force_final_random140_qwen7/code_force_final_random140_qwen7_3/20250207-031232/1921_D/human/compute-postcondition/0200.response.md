Output State: **`b2` is `m - 2`, `b1` is 0, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b2` is `m - 2`, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is `dif4`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[m-2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `b2` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `m - 1` to `m - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
