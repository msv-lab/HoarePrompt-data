Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` must be at least `n - 3`, `b1` is `b1 + 1`, `b2` remains unchanged, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is `ans + dif1`.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states. Therefore, `b1` is updated to `b1 + 1`, while `a1`, `a2`, `b2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans` retain their previous values.
