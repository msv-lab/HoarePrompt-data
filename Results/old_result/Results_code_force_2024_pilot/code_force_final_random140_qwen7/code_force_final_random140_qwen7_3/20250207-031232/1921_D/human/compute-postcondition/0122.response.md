Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code defines `dif4` as the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. This does not affect the values of `dif1`, `dif2`, or `dif3`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged. The new variable `dif4` is set to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.
