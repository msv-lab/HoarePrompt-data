Output State: **`ans` is `dif2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2-1]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `dif2`, which was originally the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2]`, now becomes the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2-1]`. The other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4`) retain their original values.
