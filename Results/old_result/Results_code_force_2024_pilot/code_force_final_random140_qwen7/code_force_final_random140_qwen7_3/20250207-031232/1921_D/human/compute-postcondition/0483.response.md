Output State: **`b1` is `m-1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is `m-1`, `ans` is the minimum possible sum of absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` after all iterations, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `a1` will be 0 because the loop continues as long as `a1 <= a2`, and `a2` is only decremented and never incremented, so `a1` will eventually reach 0. Similarly, `a2` will be 0 because it is only decremented and never incremented. The variable `b1` will be `m-1` because the loop increments `b1` until it reaches `m-1` and then stops, as `a1` becomes greater than `a2`. The variable `b2` will also be `m-1` for the same reason. The variable `ans` will hold the minimum possible sum of absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` after all iterations, as the loop optimally matches elements of `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified.
