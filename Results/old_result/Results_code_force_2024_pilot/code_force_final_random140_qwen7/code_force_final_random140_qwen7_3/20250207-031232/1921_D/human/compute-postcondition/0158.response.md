Postcondition: **`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` represent the absolute differences as defined. `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, then `a2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by `dif3`, and `b1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`. If `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, then `a2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by `dif4`, and the differences are recalculated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and the differences are recalculated with `a1+1` and `b1+1`. If `dif1` is not greater than `dif2`, then `ans` is updated based on the minimum of `dif3` and `dif2 + dif2`, and the variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a2`, and `b2` are updated accordingly (i.e., `a2` is decreased by 1 and `b2` is decreased by 1).**
