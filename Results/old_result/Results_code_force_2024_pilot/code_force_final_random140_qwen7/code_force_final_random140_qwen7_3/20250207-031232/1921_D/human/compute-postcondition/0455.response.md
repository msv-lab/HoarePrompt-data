Output State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` is `a2 - 1`; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif4`; `b2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes the conditions for `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`.
- The code snippet `b2 -= 1` decreases the value of `b2` by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
