Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2] - 1`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif2`.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `b2`, it could be either `n - 2` or `n - 1`. After decrementing, `b2` will be one less than its original value, making it `n - 3` if it was originally `n - 2`, or `n - 2` if it was originally `n - 1`. However, since the exact value of `b2` before the operation is not specified, we keep it in terms of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
