Output State: **`b2` is `m - 2`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[m-1]`, `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, and the condition `dif4 > dif2` is true.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. Since `b2` was originally `m - 1`, after the decrement, `b2` becomes `m - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
