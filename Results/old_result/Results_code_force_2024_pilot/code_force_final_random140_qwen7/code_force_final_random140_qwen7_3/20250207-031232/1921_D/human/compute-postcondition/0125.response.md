Output State: **`a2` is `a2` - 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is `ans` plus `dif3`; `b1` is `b1` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `b1` is updated to its new value, while `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans` retain their original values.
