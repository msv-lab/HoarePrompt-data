Output State: **`b1` is 0; `t` is equal to `t - 1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is `dif3`; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif3` updates the value of `ans` by adding `dif3` to its current value. Since the initial value of `ans` is `dif3`, after executing this line, `ans` becomes `2 * dif3`. However, since `dif3` is defined as `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])` and remains greater than `dif1`, which is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, the only updated variable is `ans`, which now holds the value of `dif3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
