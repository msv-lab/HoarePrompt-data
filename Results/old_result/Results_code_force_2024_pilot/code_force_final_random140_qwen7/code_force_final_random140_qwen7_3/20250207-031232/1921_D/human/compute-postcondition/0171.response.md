Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the same values for all variables except for `ans`, which is explicitly set to 0.
