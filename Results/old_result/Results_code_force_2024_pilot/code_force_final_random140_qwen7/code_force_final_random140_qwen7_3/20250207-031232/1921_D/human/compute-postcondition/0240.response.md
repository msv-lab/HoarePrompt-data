Output State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `ans` is either `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, or `dif4` depending on the condition; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `dif1` to be the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
