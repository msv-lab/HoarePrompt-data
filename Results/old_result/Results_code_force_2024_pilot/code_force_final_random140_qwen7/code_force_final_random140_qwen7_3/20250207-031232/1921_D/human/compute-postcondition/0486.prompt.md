You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.

    #State: `t` is 0, `b1` is `m-1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `b2` is `m-1`, and `ans` is the minimum possible sum of absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. For each test case, it checks if t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and if n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, with the sum of m not exceeding 2 × 10^5 across all test cases. Additionally, it verifies that a_i and b_i are integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The function does not return any specific value but rather validates the input constraints for each test case.
