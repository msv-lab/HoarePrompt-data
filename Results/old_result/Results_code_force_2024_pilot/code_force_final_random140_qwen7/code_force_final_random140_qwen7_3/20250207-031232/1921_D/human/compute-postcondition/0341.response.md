Output State: **`a1` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif3`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`.**

Explanation: The line `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. Since `a2` was initially `n - 1`, after executing this line, `a2` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
