Postcondition: **`ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, then `ans` is the minimum of `dif3` and `dif2` + `dif2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif4` and the variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a2`, and `b2` are updated accordingly (i.e., `a2` is decreased by 1 and `b2` is decreased by 1).**
