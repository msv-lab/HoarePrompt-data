Postcondition: `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `dif3 > dif2`, then `ans` is updated by adding `dif3` to its current value, where `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]` and `b1` is either 1 or 2; otherwise, `b2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `dif2`, and `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2.
