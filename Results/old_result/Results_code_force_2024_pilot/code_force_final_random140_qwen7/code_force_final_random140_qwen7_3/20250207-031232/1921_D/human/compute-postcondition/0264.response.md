Output State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is increased by 1 and is now less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is decreased by 1 and is still within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is `ans + dif2`.**

The code `b2 -= 1` decreases the value of `b2` by 1. Since `b2` was originally within the range of `b`, after decrementing by 1, it remains within the range of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
