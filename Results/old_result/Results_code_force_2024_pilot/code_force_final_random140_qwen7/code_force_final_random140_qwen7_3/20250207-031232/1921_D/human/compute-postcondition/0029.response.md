Output State: **`b1` is 1, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `ans + dif1`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`**.

Explanation: The variable `b1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
