Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif1`; `a1` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `a1` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions or expressions based on the initial state.
