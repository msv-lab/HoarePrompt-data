Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif4`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b1` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b2` is `m - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. Initially, `a2` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `a2` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
