Output State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `dif2` to its current value; `a1` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `a1` is incremented by 1. Since `a1` was previously less than or equal to `a2`, after incrementing `a1` by 1, it becomes less than `a2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
