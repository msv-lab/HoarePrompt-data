Output State: **`b1` is either 1 or 2; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is one more than `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `dif1` to its current value; `a1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. Since `b1` was initially either 0, 1, or 2, after the increment, `b1` will now be either 1 or 2 (if it was 0) or 2 or 3 (if it was 1), but since `b` is assumed to have indices within its defined range, `b1` will remain either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
