Postcondition: `b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is either `abs(a[a1 + 1] - b[b2 - 1])` or `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is either `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])` or `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is either `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])` or `abs(a[a2] - b[b2 - 1])`; `ans` is updated such that if `dif1 > dif2`, `ans` is updated according to whether `dif3 > dif4`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `max(dif3, dif2)` if `dif3 > dif4` is true, otherwise it is increased by either `dif4` or `dif2` depending on the condition `dif4 > dif2`, and `a1` and `a2` are adjusted accordingly.
