Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1 + 1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif2`.**

Explanation: The value of `a1` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a1` now refers to the next index in the list `a` compared to its previous value. The updated state of `dif2` reflects this change, now being `abs(a[a1 + 1] - b[b2])` instead of `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`. All other variables retain their original values or expressions.
