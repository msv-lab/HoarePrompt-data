To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition and the variables involved in it.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a1 <= a2`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables directly involved in the loop condition are `a1` and `a2`.

### Current States:
- `a1` is either 0 or 1.
- `a2` is either `n - 3`, `n - 2`, or `n - 1`.

### Loop Execution Criteria:
- For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `a1 <= a2` must still hold true after the current iteration.

### Possible Adjustments:
- **Adjusting `a1`**: Since `a1` can only be 0 or 1, it cannot be changed to a value that would violate the condition `a1 <= a2`.
- **Adjusting `a2`**: To ensure the loop continues, `a2` should be such that `a1 <= a2` remains true.

Given the possible values of `a2` (`n - 3`, `n - 2`, or `n - 1`), and knowing that `a1` can only be 0 or 1, the smallest value `a2` can take is `n - 3`. Therefore, to ensure the loop continues, `a2` must be at least `n - 3`.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes one more time is `a2`. It must be set to a value such that `a1 <= a2` holds true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` must be at least `n - 3`, `b1` is incremented by 1 if `a1` is 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2 - 1]` or `b[b2]` depending on the value of `a2`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `dif3` (when `a2` is `n - 2`) and `dif2` (when `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 3`), and `b1` is incremented by 1 if `a1` is 1.**
