Output State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is increased by `dif3`**.

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. Since `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, it now becomes less than or equal to `a2 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
