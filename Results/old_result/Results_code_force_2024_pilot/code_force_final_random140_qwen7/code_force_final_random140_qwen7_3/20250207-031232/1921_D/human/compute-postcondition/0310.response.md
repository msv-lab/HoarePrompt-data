Postcondition: **`b2` is decremented by 1 if `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, otherwise `b2` remains unchanged. `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2. `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. `t` is a positive integer less than its original value. `n` and `m` are input integers. `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. `a1` is less than `a2`. `ans` is updated by adding the appropriate difference (`dif4` if `dif4 > dif2`, otherwise `dif2`) to its current value. `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**
