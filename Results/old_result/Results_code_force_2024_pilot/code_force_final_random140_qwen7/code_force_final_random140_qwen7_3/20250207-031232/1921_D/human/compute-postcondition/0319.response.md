Output State: **`n` is now `n` (input integer), `m` is now `m` (input integer), `t` is now `t-1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop, with the loop terminating when `a1` exceeds `a2`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
