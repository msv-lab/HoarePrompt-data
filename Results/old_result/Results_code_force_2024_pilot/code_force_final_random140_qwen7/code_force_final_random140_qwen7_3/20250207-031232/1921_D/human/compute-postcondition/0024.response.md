Output State: **`b1` is 0; `t` is equal to `t - 1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 2`; `b2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is `dif3`; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`.**

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
