Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif4`.**

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
