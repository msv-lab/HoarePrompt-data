Output State: **`b1` is 0, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a space-separated string, `ans` is 0, `b` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `b`, the only change is that `b` is now sorted. All other variables remain unchanged.
