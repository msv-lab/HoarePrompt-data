Output State: **`ans` is `dif1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `a1 += 1` increments the value of `a1` by 1. Initially, `a1` was used to index into list `a`. After the increment, `a1` now refers to the next element in list `a`. However, since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `a1`, `b1`, `b2`, `a2` are not provided, we cannot simplify further. All other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) remain unchanged.
