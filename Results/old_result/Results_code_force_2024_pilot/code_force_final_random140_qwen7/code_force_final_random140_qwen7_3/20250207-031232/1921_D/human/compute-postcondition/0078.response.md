Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`**

Explanation: The code initializes `dif2` with the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`. The values of `b1`, `dif1`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the newly defined `dif2`.
