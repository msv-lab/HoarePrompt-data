Output State: **`a2` is `a2` - 1, `ans` is `ans` + `dif4`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `b2` is `b2` - 1.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `b2` is updated to `b2 - 1`.
