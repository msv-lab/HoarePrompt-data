Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` must be at least `n - 3`, `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is `ans + dif1`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `a1` is either 0 or 1.
- After executing `a1 += 1`, `a1` is incremented by 1. Since `a1` was either 0 or 1, after incrementing, `a1` becomes 1.
- The conditions for `a2`, `b1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `a1`.
