Postcondition: `a1` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is either `dif2`, `dif3`, or `dif4`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`, and `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b2])`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif4` and `a2` is `n - 2`, then `ans` is `dif3`; otherwise, `ans` is `dif4` if `dif4` is greater than `dif2`; otherwise, `ans` is `dif2`.
