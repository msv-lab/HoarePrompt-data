Output State: **`ans` is `dif2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `a1 += 1` increments the value of `a1` by 1. This affects the calculation of `dif1` and `dif2`, which now use `a[a1+1]` instead of `a[a1]`. The values of `a1`, `b1`, `b2`, `a2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.
