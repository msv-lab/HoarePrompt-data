Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif4`.**

The code `ans += dif4` increments the value of `ans` by `dif4`. Since `dif4` is defined as the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, the updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus this difference. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
