Output State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` must be at least `n - 3`; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif3`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `dif3` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. `a1` remains either 0 or 1, `a2` must still be at least `n - 3`, `b1` increments by 1 if `a1` is 1, and `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their definitions based on the initial conditions.
