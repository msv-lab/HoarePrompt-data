Output State: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` is `a2 - 1`; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif3`.**

Explanation: The variable `a2` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and relationships remain the same. Specifically, `a2` is now `a2 - 1`, and the expressions for `b1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans` remain as described in the initial state, with `a2` updated accordingly.
