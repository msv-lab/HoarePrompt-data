Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif4`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`; `a2` is decreased by 1; `b2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `b2`.
