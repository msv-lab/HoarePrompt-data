Postcondition: **`a1` is either 0 or 1; `a2` is `a2 - 1`; `b1` is `b1 + 1` if `a1` is 1; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is updated according to the condition: if `dif4 > dif2`, then `ans = ans + dif4`; otherwise, `ans = ans + dif2`; `b2` is decreased by 1.**
