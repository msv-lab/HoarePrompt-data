Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `a2` is `a2 - 1`; `ans` is `ans + dif4`**

Explanation: The variable `a2` is decremented by 1, so `a2` is now `a2 - 1`. All other variables retain their original expressions or values.
