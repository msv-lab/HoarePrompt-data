Output State: **`b1` is either 0 or 1; `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`; `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`; `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`; `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`; `ans` is `ans + dif1`; `a1` is `a1 + 1`**.

The value of `a1` is incremented by 1, while the values of `b1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
