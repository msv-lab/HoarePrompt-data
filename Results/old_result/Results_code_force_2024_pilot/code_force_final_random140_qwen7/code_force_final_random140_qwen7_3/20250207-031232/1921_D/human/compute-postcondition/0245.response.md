Output State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2-1`; `b2` is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1]` plus `ans`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` now translates to `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2-1` since `a2` has been reduced by 1.
