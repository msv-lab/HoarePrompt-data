Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2] - 1`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-3]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-3]` and `b[b2] - 1`, `ans` is `ans + dif4`.**

Explanation: The value of `b2` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 2` to `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
