Postcondition: **`b2` is decreased by 1 if `dif4 > dif1`, otherwise `b1` is either 1 or 2. `dif3` is updated based on the new value of `b1` and `b2`. `t` is a positive integer less than its original value. `n` and `m` are input integers. `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. `a1` is adjusted accordingly (`a2 - 1` if `b2` is decreased, `a2 + 1` if `b1` changes). `b2` remains within the valid range of `b`. `ans` is updated by adding either `dif4` or `dif1` to its current value. `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**
