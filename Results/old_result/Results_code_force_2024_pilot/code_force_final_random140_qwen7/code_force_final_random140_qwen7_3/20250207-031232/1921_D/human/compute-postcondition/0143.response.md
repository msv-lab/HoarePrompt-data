Output State: **`ans` is `dif3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. Therefore, `b1` now refers to the next index in the list `b` (assuming `b` is a list). The values of `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged from their initial states.
