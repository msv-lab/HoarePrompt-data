Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif2`.**

Explanation: The code `a1 += 1` increments the value of `a1` by 1. Initially, `a1` was 0, so now `a1` is 1. The values of `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
