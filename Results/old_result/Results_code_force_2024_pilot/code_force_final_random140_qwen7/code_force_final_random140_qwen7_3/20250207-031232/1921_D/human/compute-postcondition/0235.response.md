Postcondition: `b2` is `m - 2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is either `dif2` (if `dif4 <= dif2`) or `dif4` (if `dif4 > dif2`), `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m-1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n-1]` and `b[m-1]`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`.
