Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the elements at index `a1` in list `a` and the element at index `b1` in list `b`, and assigns this value to `dif1`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the initial conditions for `a`, `b`, `a1`, and `b1` remain unchanged, and only `dif1` is updated with the calculated value.
