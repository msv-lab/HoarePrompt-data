Output State: **`b1` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `t` is a positive integer less than its original value; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `a1` is less than `a2`; `b2` is decremented by 1 and now is an index within the range of `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `dif2` to its current value; `a1` is incremented by 1.**

This means that `b2` has been decremented by 1, but the exact value of `b2` is not specified since it was already within the range of `b`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or values as described in the initial state.
