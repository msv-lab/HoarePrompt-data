Output State: **`a1` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is `n - 1` less than its initial value, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif1`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`. The current value of `dif4` is not greater than `dif1`.**

Explanation: The code `a1 += 1` increments the value of `a1` by 1. Initially, `a1` was 0, so now `a1` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
