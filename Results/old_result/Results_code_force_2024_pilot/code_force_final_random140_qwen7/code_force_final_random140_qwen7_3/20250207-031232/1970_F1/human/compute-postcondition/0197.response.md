Output State: **`command` is split into `obj` and `com`, `time` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`, `pos`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player`, and `elements[obj]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**

This means that the `nxt` variable is updated based on the current position (`pos`) and the movement vector (`mov[com]`). The `pos` itself does not change, but `nxt` is calculated as the new position based on the movement. All other variables retain their previous values.
