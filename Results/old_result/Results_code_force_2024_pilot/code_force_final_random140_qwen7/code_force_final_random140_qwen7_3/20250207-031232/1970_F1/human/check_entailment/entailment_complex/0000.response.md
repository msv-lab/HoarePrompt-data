Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function correctly initializes the grid and reads the input fields, players, and goals.
   - It correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the commands provided.
   - It handles the scoring logic appropriately, detecting when a player scores in the opponent's goal and when a player scores in their own goal.
   - The function correctly prints the events as they occur during the game and outputs the final score at the end.

2. **Function `goalIn(pos)`**:
   - This function correctly identifies whether a given position is a red goal ('RG') or a blue goal ('BG') and returns the appropriate team index (0 for red, 1 for blue).
   - It handles cases where the position is neither a red nor a blue goal by returning -1.

3. **Function `isPlayer(el)`**:
   - This function correctly identifies whether a given entity is a player (i.e., it starts with 'R' or 'B' and is not a goal).
   - It correctly handles the conditions for identifying a player.

Given that all functions are implemented correctly and handle the problem requirements accurately, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
