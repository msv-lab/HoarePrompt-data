Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command` (which is '.Q'), and `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`**.

In this state, the `allPlayers` dictionary has been updated such that the key `obj` now maps to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values.
