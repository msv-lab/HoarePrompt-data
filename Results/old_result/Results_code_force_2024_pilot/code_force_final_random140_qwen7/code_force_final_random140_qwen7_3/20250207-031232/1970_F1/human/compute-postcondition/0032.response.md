Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `ind` is 2. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list that now includes the tuple `(2, 2)`**.
