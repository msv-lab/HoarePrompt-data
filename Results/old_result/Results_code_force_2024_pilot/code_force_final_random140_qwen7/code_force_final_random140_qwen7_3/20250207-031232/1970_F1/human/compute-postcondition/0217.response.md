Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `comand` is equal to `stdin.readline().strip().split()`, `time` is time + 1, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `team`, `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()` reads a line of input from stdin, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `comand`. The initial state of `command` is updated to `comand`, which is the result of the split operation. The other variables (`time`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `team`, `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc.) remain unchanged as per the precondition.
