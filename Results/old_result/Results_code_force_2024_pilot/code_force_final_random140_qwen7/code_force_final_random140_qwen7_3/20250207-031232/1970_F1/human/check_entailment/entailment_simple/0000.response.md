### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`) and initializes the grid, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points`.
   - The loop populates the `grid` and `elements` dictionary correctly, and identifies the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.

2. **Action Processing:**
   - The program processes each action correctly:
     - For commands involving catching or throwing the Quaffle, it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary and checks if a goal has been scored.
     - For movement commands, it updates the positions of players and checks for valid movements.
     - It handles the special cases of catching and throwing the Quaffle appropriately.

3. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the `points` accordingly.
   - It prints the appropriate messages when a team scores a goal and prints the final score at the end of the game.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as invalid movements and scoring in the wrong goal by printing the correct messages.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the events in the correct format and order, and the final score is printed correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Correctness: **True**
