Postcondition: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin. If `len(comand) == 3`, then `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, and `el` is the third element of `comand`. If `el == '.Q'`, then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. Otherwise, `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0] == 'B'`, and to 0 otherwise. Additionally, `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(comand) != 3`, then `command` is split into `obj` and `com`, `time` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `obj`, `com`, and `el` are updated according to the new command, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and `elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True or if `isPlayer(obj)` is True and `elements['.B'] == nxt`, then `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` and if `goalIn(pos)` returns a valid team, the points for that team are incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If none of these conditions are met, `player`, `elements[obj]`, and other variables remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
