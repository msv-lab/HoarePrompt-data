Postcondition: `player` is determined based on whether `obj` is a player or a bishop. If `obj` is a player, `player` is `obj`; if `obj` is a bishop and there's a player at `nxt`, `player` is the player at `nxt`. `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`. If `obj` is a bishop, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and `command`, `obj`, `com`, `time`, `pos`, `player`, `elements`, `t` remain unchanged.
