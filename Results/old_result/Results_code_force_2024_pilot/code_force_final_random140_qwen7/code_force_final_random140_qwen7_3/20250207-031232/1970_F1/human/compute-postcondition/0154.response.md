Output State: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`**.

This means that the variable `nxt` has been calculated as a new tuple based on the current position `pos` and the movement vector `mov[com]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
