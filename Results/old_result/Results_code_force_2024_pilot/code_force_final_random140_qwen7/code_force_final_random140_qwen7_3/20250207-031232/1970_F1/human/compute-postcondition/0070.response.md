Output State: **`tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `ind` is 1, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.**

This means that the variable `tmp` is assigned the value 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', and 1 otherwise. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
