Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team wins a point. However, the `goalIn` function checks if the position is in the opponent's goal, but it does not handle the case where a player might accidentally or intentionally score in their own goal. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

In this case, the red player scores in their own goal, but the program does not account for this scenario and does not award a point to the blue team. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
