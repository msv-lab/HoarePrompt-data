Output State: **`tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `line` is a list of strings with at least one element; `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list; `elements[line[ind]]` is not equal to `(i, ind)`; `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since the value of `tmp` is determined by the first character of `line[ind]` (either 0 if it's 'B' or 1 otherwise), and the other variables (`n`, `i`, `line`, `grid`, and `elements[line[ind]]`) remain unchanged, the updated state includes the new entry in `goal[tmp]`.
