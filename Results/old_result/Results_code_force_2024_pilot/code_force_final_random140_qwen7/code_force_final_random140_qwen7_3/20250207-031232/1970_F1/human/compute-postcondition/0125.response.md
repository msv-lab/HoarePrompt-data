Postcondition: `ind` is `len(line)` - 1; `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, len(line) - 1)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` contains a tuple `(i, ind)`, where `i` is the same as in the precondition.
