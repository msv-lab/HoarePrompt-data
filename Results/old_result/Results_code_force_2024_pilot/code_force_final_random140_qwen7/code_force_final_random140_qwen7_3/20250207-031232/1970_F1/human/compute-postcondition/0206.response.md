Output State: **`command` is split into `obj` and `com`, `time` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`, `pos`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player`, and `elements[obj]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`.**

This means that the value of `elements[obj]` has been updated to the new position `nxt`. All other variables retain their previous values.
