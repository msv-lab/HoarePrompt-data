Postcondition: `comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. The current value of `obj` is `.B` and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, or `obj` is not `.B`, `isPlayer(obj)` is true, and `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`.
