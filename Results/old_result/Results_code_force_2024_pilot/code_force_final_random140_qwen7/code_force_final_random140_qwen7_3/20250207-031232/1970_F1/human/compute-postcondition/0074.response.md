Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `ind` is 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)` to its list; otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
