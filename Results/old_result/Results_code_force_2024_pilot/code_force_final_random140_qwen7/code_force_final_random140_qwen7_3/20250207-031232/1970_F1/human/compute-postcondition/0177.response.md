Postcondition: **`elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `com == 'T'` and `goalIn(pos) != -1`, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, `isPlayer(obj)` is true, or `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`.**
