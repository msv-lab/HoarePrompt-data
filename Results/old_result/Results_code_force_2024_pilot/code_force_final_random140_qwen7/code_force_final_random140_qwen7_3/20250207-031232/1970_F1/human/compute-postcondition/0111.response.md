Output State: **`elements[elements[line[ind]]]` is (i, ind), `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `tmp` is 0, `goal[tmp]` is appended with (i, ind)**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `tmp` is `0`, the tuple `(i, ind)` is added to `goal[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
