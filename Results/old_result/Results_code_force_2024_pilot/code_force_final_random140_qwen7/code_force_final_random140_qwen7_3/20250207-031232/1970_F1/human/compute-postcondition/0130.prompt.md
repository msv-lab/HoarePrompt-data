Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `points` is [0, 0], `n` is an integer with a value between 3 and 99, inclusive, and is odd; `m` is an integer with a value between 3 and 99, inclusive, and is odd; `grid` is an empty 2D list; `t` is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game; `elements` is a dictionary containing one key-value pair {' .B': (0, 0)}; `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary; `goal` is an empty list twice deep.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, `line` is a list of strings with at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list. For each `line[ind]` where `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or 'R', `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` respectively will include the tuple `(i, ind)`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will hold the final index value that the loop ran to, `line` will contain all the lines read up to that point, and `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` will be populated based on the conditions specified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements` is updated such that `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in the range of `len(line)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `ind` is equal to `len(line) - 1`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind][1]` equals 'G', then `tmp` is set to 0 or 1 based on the value of `line[ind][0]`, and `goal[tmp]` contains all the tuples `(i, ind)` that were appended during the loop's iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The final state of the variables is as follows:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
