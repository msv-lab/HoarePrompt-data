N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M characters. Each character in the field can be one of the following: '..', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', or '.Q'. The input also includes an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing the number of steps, and T lines describing the actions performed by entities on the field. Each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself (U, D, L, R, C, or T).
