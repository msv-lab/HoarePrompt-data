Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(stdin.readline().strip())`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` will be equal to `n`, `line` will contain exactly `n` elements, `grid` will be a 2D list with `n` rows, where each row is a list of strings from the input read using `stdin.readline()`, `elements` will be a dictionary where for each key-value pair `{' .B': (i, ind)}` in the initial state, the value `(i, ind)` will now be `(n-1, ind)`, `allPlayers` will remain an empty dictionary unless new players are added during the loop, which depends on the input, `goal` will be a list of two lists, each containing tuples `(i, ind)` for each goal position found in the grid, where `i` is the row index and `ind` is the column index, both incremented by the number of iterations the loop executed.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin. If the length of `comand` is 3, then `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `el` is the third element of `comand`. If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `obj`[0] is 'B', `obj`[1] is `com`, `obj`[2] is `el`, `team` is 1, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command` and its current value is '.S.', `points` dictionary has a key `team` with value 10. If the length of `comand` is not 3, then `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is assigned the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and `obj` is equal to '.B'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin. If `len(comand) == 3`, then `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, and `el` is the third element of `comand`. If `el == '.Q'`, then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. Otherwise, `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0] == 'B'`, and to 0 otherwise. Additionally, `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(comand) != 3`, then `command` is split into `obj` and `com`, `time` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `obj`, `com`, and `el` are updated according to the new command, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and `elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True or if `isPlayer(obj)` is True and `elements['.B'] == nxt`, then `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` and if `goalIn(pos)` returns a valid team, the points for that team are incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If none of these conditions are met, `player`, `elements[obj]`, and other variables remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `time` is time + 1, `player` is determined based on the elements of `command`. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is set to True in the dictionary `allPlayers` if `el` equals '.Q'. If `el` does not equal '.Q', `team` is set to 1 if the first character of `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0; `points[team]` is incremented by 10. `obj` is set to `False` in `allPlayers`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`. `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `com`, `el`, `team`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
