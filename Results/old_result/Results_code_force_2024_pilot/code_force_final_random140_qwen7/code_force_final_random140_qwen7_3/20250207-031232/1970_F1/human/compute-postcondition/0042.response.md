Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings with at least 4 elements, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `ind` is 3. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False and `ind` remains 3. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[3][0]` equals 'B', else `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` is a list that now includes the tuple `(2, 3)` if `line[3][1]` equals 'G', otherwise `tmp` remains as it was.**
