Postcondition: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin. If the length of `comand` is 3, then `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `el` is the third element of `comand`. If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `obj`[0] is 'B', `obj`[1] is `com`, `obj`[2] is `el`, `team` is 1, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command` and its current value is '.S.', `points` dictionary has a key `team` with value 10. If the length of `comand` is not 3, then `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is assigned the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and `obj` is equal to '.B'.**
