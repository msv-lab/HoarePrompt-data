Output State: **`ind` is `len(line)` - 1; `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, len(line) - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the `elements` dictionary with the tuple `(i, ind)`, where `ind` is the last index of the `line` list (since `ind` was initially `len(line)`). After the operation, `ind` is decremented by 1 because `line[ind]` refers to the last element of the list, and `ind` is updated to point to this element. The other variables remain unchanged.
