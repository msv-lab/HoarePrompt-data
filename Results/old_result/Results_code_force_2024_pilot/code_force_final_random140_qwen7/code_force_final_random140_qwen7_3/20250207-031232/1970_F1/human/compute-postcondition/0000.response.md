Output State: **`el` is a string representing an entity on the field where the first character is the team of the entity ('R' for red, 'B' for blue) and the second character is additional information (e.g., player number or 'G' for goal); `res` is a boolean value which is True if the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise False.**

This output state reflects that the variable `el` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state, while a new variable `res` has been created and assigned a boolean value based on the conditions specified in the code.
