Output State: **`ind` is `len(line)` - 1; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1**

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of `line[ind]` (which is `line[len(line) - 1]` since `ind` is `len(line) - 1`) is 'B'. If it is 'B', `tmp` is assigned 0; otherwise, `tmp` is assigned 1. The value of `ind` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state.
