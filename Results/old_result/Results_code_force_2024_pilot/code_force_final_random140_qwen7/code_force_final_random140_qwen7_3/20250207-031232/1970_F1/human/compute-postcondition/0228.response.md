Output State: **`nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `time` is time + 1, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `team`, `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains the same.**

This means that the `nxt` variable now holds the new position calculated by adding the movement vector specified by `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
