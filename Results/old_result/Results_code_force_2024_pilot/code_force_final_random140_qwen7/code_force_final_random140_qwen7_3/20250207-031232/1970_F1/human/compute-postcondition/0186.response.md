Output State: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin; `obj`, `com`, and `el` are assigned the first, second, and third elements of `comand`, respectively.**

The code assigns the first element of `comand` to `obj`, the second element to `com`, and the third element to `el`. All other variables (`time`, `t`, `player`, `elements[obj]`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
