Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `time` is time + 1, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `team`, `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains the same.**

This means that the command list has been unpacked into three variables (`obj`, `com`, `el`) containing the respective elements from the `command` list. The `time` variable has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
