Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `obj` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin.
     - `obj[0]` is 'B'
     - `obj[1]` is `com`
     - `obj[2]` is `el`
   - `team` is 1
   - `com` is the second element of `command`, but this is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `el` is the third element of `command` and its current value is '.S.'
   - `points` dictionary has a key `team` with value 10.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.
   - We need to determine the values of `time` and `GoalName[team]`.

Given the information:
- There is no explicit value provided for `time` and `GoalName`.
- Since `team` is 1, `GoalName[team]` would refer to `GoalName[1]`.

Since the exact values of `time` and `GoalName[1]` are not provided, we cannot determine their exact numerical or string values. However, we know that `team` is 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with `%d` replaced by the value of `time` and `%s` replaced by the value of `GoalName[1]`.

Output: **%d .S. CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where %d is the value of time and .S. is the value of GoalName[1])**
