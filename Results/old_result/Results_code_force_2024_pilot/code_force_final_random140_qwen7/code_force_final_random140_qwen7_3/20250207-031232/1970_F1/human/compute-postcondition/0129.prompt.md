Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `line` is updated to a new list of strings read from stdin, `n` must be greater than 0, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element plus the new `line`, `elements` is updated such that `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in the range of `len(line)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `ind` is equal to `len(line) - 1`, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, if `line[ind][1]` equals 'G', then `tmp` is set to 0 or 1 based on the value of `line[ind][0]`, and `goal[tmp]` contains all the tuples `(i, ind)` that were appended during the loop's iterations.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ind` is `len(line) - 1`. If `line[ind] != '..` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `ind` remains unchanged. If `line[ind] != '..` and `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `goal[tmp]` contains a tuple `(i, ind)`. In all cases, `ind` is assigned to the same value as before.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is `len(line) - 1`. If `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, then `elements[elements[line[ind]]]` is `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is `0`, and `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` evaluates to `False`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is `len(line)` - 1; `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, len(line) - 1)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` contains a tuple `(i, ind)`, where `i` is the same as in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
