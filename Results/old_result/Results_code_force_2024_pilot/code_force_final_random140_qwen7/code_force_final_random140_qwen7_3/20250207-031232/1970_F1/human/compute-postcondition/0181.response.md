Postcondition: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is assigned the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and `obj` is equal to '.B'.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. It states that `obj` is equal to '.B', and as a result, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. All other variables retain their values as specified in the precondition.
