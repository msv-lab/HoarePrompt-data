Output State: **`command` is split into `obj` and `com`, `time` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`, `pos`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player`, and `elements[obj]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration; `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`.**

This means that the variable `allPlayers[obj]` is now `False`, while all other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
