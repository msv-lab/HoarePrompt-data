Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `time` is time + 1, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `team`, `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc., remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains the same.**

This means that the first and second elements of the `command` list are assigned to `obj` and `com` respectively. The `time` variable is incremented by 1. All other variables (`el`, `team`, `points`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `elements`, etc.) remain unchanged from their previous values. The variable `t` also remains unchanged.
