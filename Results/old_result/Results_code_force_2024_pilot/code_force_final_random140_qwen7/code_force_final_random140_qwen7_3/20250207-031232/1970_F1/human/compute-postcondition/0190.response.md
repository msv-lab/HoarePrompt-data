Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `team` is determined by the value of `obj[0]`.
     - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10 from its original value, but this detail is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.
   - This statement uses a formatted string with two placeholders: `%d` for `time` and `%s` for `GoalName[team]`.

Given the initial state, the key information we need to determine the output is the value of `team` and the corresponding `GoalName[team]`.

- Since `team` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `obj[0]`, let's consider both cases:
  - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
  - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0.

- The value of `GoalName[team]` depends on the value of `team`:
  - If `team` is 1, then `GoalName[1]` is used.
  - If `team` is 0, then `GoalName[0]` is used.

Without the specific values of `time` and `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]`, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where %d is the value of time and %s is the value of GoalName[team], team being 1 if obj[0] is 'B', otherwise 0)**
