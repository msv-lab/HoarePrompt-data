Output State: **`ind` is `len(line)` - 1; `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`; `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, len(line) - 1)`**

Explanation: The code sets `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. Given that `line[ind]` is `(i, len(line) - 1)`, the value of `elements[line[ind]]` remains unchanged as it was already set to `(i, len(line) - 1)`. The value of `ind` and the content of `elements` at index `(i, len(line) - 1)` remain the same as the initial state.
