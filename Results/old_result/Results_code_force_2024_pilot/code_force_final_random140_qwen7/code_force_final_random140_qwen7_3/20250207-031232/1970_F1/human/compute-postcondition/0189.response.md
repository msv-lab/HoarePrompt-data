Output State: **`team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', else `team` is 0; `points[team]` is 10 more than its original value.**

Explanation: The code `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. The value of `team` is determined by the condition `1 if obj[0] is 'B', else 0`. This value does not change, but the value of `points[team]` is updated by adding 10 to its current value.
