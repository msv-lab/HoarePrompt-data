### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `isPlayer`**: This function correctly identifies whether a given element is a player. It checks if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function `goalIn`**: This function checks if a given position is in one of the goals. It returns 0 if the position is in the red team's goal, 1 if it is in the blue team's goal, and -1 otherwise. This function is used to determine if a player has scored a goal.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads the grid and initializes the state.
   - It processes each command, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle.
   - When a player catches the Quaffle, it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to mark the player as carrying the Quaffle.
   - When a player throws the Quaffle, it updates the position of the Quaffle and checks if the position is in a goal using `goalIn`.
   - If the position is in a goal, it prints the appropriate message and increments the score for the opposing team.

Let's consider the specific example provided in the original assessment:

```plaintext
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

- The red player (R0) starts at (0, 0) and moves to (0, 1).
- It catches the Quaffle at (0, 1).
- It then moves to (1, 1) and throws the Quaffle.
- The Quaffle is now at (1, 1).
- The blue player (B0) moves to (1, 0) and catches the Quaffle.
- It then moves to (0, 0) and scores in the red team's goal.

Here is what happens step-by-step:
- When B0 catches the Quaffle, it is marked as carrying the Quaffle.
- When B0 moves to (0, 0) and scores in the red team's goal, the `goalIn` function returns 0 (indicating the red team's goal).
- The program correctly prints "12 RED GOAL" and increments the blue team's score.

Therefore, the program correctly handles the scenario where a player scores in the opponent's goal.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal by correctly incrementing the score of the opposing team.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
