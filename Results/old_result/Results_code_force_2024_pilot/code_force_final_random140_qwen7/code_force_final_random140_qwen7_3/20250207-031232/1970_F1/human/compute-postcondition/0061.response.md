Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements` is updated such that `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `ind` is 0, the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, the function `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and if the current character in `line[ind]` is `'G'`, then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, ind)`.
