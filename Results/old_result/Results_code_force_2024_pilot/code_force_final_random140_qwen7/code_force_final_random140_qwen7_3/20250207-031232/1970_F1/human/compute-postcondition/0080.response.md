Output State: **`tmp` is 0; `ind` is 2; `goal[0]` contains ((i, 2))**

Explanation: The code `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given that `tmp` is 0 and `ind` is 2, the tuple `(i, 2)` is appended to `goal[0]`. The values of `tmp` and `ind` remain unchanged.
