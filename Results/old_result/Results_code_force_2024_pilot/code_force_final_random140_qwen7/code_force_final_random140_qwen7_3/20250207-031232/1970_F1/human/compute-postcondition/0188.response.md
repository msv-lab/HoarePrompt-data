Output State: **`team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', else `team` is 0; `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of `comand`, respectively.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `team` if the first element of the list `obj` is 'B', otherwise it assigns 0 to `team`. The values of `obj`, `com`, and `el` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
