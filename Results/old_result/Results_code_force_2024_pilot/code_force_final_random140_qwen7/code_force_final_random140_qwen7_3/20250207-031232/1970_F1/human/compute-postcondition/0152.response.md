Output State: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`.**

The code assigns the first element of the list `comand` to the variable `obj` and the second element to the variable `com`. The length of `comand` is not specified to change, so it remains a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, and its length is not equal to 3.
