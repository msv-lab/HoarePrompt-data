Output State: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element in the list `elements` at the index specified by `obj` to the variable `pos`. The values of `comand`, `obj`, and `com` remain unchanged.
