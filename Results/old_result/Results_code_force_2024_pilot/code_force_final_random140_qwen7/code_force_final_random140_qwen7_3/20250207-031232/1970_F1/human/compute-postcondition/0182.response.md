Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin. If `command` has exactly 3 elements, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. 

- If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`.
- If `el` is not '.Q' and `obj[0]` is 'B', then `obj[1]` is `com`, `obj[2]` is `el`, `team` is 1, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command` and its current value is '.S.', `points` dictionary has a key `team` with value 10.
- If none of the above conditions are met, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is assigned the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and `obj` is equal to '.B'.
