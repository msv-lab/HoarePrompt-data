Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `ind` is 2**

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of `line[ind]` (where `ind` is 2) is 'B'. Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `line[2]`, we consider the condition `if line[ind][0] == 'B'`. If `line[2][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, `tmp` is set to 1. Given no specific value for `line[2][0]` other than it is not necessarily 'B', we only know `tmp` is either 0 or 1. However, since the problem asks to be as specific as possible with given conditions, and assuming the condition is met (as per the initial state), `tmp` is specifically set to 0. The value of `ind` remains unchanged at 2.
