Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings with at least 4 elements, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0 if `line[3][0]` equals 'B', else `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` is a list that now includes the tuple `(2, 3)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `ind` is 3. The value of `tmp` determines which list in `goal` the tuple is appended to. If `line[3][0]` is 'B', then `tmp` is 0, and the tuple is appended to `goal[0]`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1, and the tuple is appended to `goal[1]`. Since the problem does not specify the value of `line[3][0]`, both cases are considered, but the final state is described with the tuple being added to `goal[tmp]`.
