Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element, `elements` is updated such that `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, `index ind` is 0, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`. Additionally, since `isPlayer(line[ind])` evaluates to `True`, `line[ind]` represents a player.
