Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m, which are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. It also accepts a 2D list of strings called grid representing the field, and a non-negative integer t representing the number of steps in the game. The function returns a value based on the state of the field after t steps.**

This means the function `func_1` takes a grid representing a game field with specific dimensions (n and m), where n and m are both odd integers between 3 and 99 inclusive. It also takes an integer t representing the number of steps in the game. The function processes the grid according to the rules of the game for t steps and returns the state of the field after these steps.
