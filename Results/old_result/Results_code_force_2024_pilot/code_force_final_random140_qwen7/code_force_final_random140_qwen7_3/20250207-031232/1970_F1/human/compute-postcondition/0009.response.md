Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `ind`: This is the index variable used in the `range` function.
   - `line`: This is the list of strings obtained from reading a line from standard input and splitting it by whitespace.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `ind` is initialized to 0.
   - `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line from standard input and splitting it by whitespace.
   - `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list (though this is not directly relevant to the loop head).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than the length of `line`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `ind` is initialized to 0, it will start the loop.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `ind` must be less than the length of `line`. Therefore, `line` must have at least one element.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the length of `line`. Specifically, `line` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list**
