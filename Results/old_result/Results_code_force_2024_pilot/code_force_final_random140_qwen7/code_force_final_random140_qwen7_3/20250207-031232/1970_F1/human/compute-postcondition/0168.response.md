Output State: **`team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `com` is equal to 'T', `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, `isPlayer(obj)` is false, or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`, `points[team]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `points[team] += 1` increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
