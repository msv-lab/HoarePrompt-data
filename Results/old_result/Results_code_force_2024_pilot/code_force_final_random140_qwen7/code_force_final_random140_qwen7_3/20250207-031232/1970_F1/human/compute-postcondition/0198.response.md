Output State: **`command` is split into `obj` and `com`, `time` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `pos` is now equal to `elements[obj]`, `pos`, `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and `elements[obj]` remains unchanged.**

This means that the `player` variable is updated based on whether `obj` is a player or not. If `obj` is a player, `player` is set to `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is set to the element at the new position `nxt` in the `grid`. All other variables retain their previous values.
