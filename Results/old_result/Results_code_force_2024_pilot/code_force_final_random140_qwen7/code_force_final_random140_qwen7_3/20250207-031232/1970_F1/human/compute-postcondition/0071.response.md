Output State: **`tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `line` is a list of strings with at least 1 element; `grid` includes the original `line` list as its last element; `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`; `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged; `ind` is 1; `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)` to its list.**

Explanation: The code appends `(i, ind)` to `goal[tmp]`. Given that `ind` is 1, the value of `tmp` determines which list in `goal` is being modified. Since `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise it is 1, `goal[tmp]` is the list that gets updated. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
