Postcondition: `comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the list `elements` at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `com` is equal to 'T', `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, and `isPlayer(obj)` is false, or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. Additionally, the goal position has been found and its index is not -1.
