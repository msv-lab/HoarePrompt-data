Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is not equal to `'..'`, then either `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, or `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list that now includes the tuple `(2, 2)`.
