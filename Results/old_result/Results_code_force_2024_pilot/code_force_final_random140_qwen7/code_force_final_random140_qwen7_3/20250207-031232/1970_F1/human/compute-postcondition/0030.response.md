Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, `grid` is a list that includes the `line` list, `ind` is 2, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` is a list that now includes the tuple `(2, 2)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 2 and `ind` is 2. The value of `tmp` is determined by the first character of `line[2]`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, `goal[tmp]` is updated to include the tuple `(2, 2)`. All other variables remain in their initial states except for the addition of the tuple to `goal[tmp]`.
