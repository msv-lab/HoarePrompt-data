pos is a string representing a position on the field, where the position is one of the characters 'RG', 'BG', or a coordinate pair like 'R1', 'B2', etc., indicating a player or a goal. The function checks if the given position is a red goal ('RG') or a blue goal ('BG'), and returns 0 for a red goal, 1 for a blue goal, and -1 otherwise.
