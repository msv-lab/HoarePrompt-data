You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        ls = input().split()
        
        last = int(ls.pop())
        
        other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
        
        print(last + other)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings from the input excluding the last element for each iteration, `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls` for the last iteration, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list of `ls` for the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
    #- The variable `t` will still hold its initial value as long as it was greater than 0.
    #- The loop counter `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.
    #- The variable `n` will be an integer input for the last iteration of the loop.
    #- The list `ls` will be a list of strings from the inputs excluding the last element for each iteration.
    #- The variable `last` will be the integer value of the last element of the original `ls` from the last iteration.
    #- The variable `other` will be the second largest element in the sorted list of `ls` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of sub-cases, followed by t pairs of integers. For each pair, the first integer n (2 <= n <= 100) represents the count of subsequent integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function returns results based on the processing of these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
