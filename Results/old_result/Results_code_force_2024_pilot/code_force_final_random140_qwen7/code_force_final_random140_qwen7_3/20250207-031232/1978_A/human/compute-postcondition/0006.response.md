Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ls` is a list without its last element.
- `last` is the last element of the original `ls`.
- `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls`.

We need to determine what will be printed for the expression `last + other`.

1. **`last`**: This is the last element of the original list `ls`. Since `ls` is a list without its last element, `last` would be the last element of the full original list.

2. **`other`**: This is the second largest element in the original `ls`. To find this, we need to consider the full list `ls` including the last element.

Given these points, the expression `last + other` will add the last element of the original list and the second largest element of the original list.

Output: **last (the last element of the original ls) + other (the second largest element of the original ls)**
