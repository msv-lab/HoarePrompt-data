Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer with any leading or trailing whitespace stripped.
- `ls` is a list of strings split from the input (excluding the last element).
- `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`.
- `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls` before sorting, and it is now the second largest element in the sorted list.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the values of `last` and `other`.

- `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original list `ls`.
- `other` is the second largest element in the original list `ls` before sorting, and it remains the second largest after sorting.

Given these details, the expression `last + other` will add the integer value of the last element of the original list `ls` to the second largest element in the original list `ls`.

Output: **last + other (where last is the integer value of the last element of the original ls and other is the second largest element in the original ls before sorting)**
