Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of sub-cases, followed by t pairs of integers. For each pair, the first integer n (2 <= n <= 100) represents the count of subsequent integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function returns results based on the processing of these inputs.**
