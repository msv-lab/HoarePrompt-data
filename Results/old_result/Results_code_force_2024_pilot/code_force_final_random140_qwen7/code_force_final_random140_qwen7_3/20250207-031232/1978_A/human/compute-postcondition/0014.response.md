Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings split from the input (excluding the last element), `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list, `n` is the integer value of the input stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` takes an input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `ls`, `last`, `other`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
