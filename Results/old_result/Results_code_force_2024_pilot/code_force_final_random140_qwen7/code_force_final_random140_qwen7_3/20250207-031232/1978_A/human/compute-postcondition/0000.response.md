Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now equal to the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 500`, the new value of `t` is now the integer input by the user, which falls within this range. All other variables remain unchanged.
