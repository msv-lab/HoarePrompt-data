Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles such that each pile has at least one book and Alice reads the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.
- The provided program attempts to solve this by:
  1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
  2. For each test case:
     - Reading the number of books `n`.
     - Splitting the input string into a list of strings, converting them to integers, and sorting the list.
     - Popping the last element (which is the largest) and the second last element (which is the second largest).
     - Printing the sum of these two elements.
- This approach is correct because:
  - Sorting the list ensures that the largest and second-largest elements are correctly identified.
  - Popping the last and second last elements gives us the largest and second-largest values, respectively.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each test case as required.

Correctness: **True**
