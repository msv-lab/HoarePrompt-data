Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings from the input excluding the last element, `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list, `ls` is updated to a list of strings from the input excluding the last element.**

Explanation: The code `last = int(ls.pop())` pops the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `last`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and the nature of `i`, `n`, `ls`, `last`, and `other` are preserved.
