Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace, `ls` is a list of strings split from the input (excluding the last element), `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest element in the original `ls`.**

Explanation: The line `last = int(ls.pop())` pops the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `last`. The `ls` list is now one element shorter. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
