Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is already given as 3.
   - `x` is given as an integer entered by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`. Since `i` is initially 3, the loop will execute as long as `x > 3`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `x` must be greater than 3.
   - The value of `i` is already set to 3, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`, ensuring that it is greater than 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than 3, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 3, `s` is 1**
