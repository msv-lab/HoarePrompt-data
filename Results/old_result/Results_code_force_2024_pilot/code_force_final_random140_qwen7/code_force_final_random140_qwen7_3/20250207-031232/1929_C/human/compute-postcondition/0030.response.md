Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is already given as 8.
   - `x` is given as an integer entered by the user.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 8, we need to ensure that `x` is greater than 8 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The value of `i` will change within the loop, but the initial value of `i` (which is 8) is part of the loop head and needs to be considered.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x`, ensuring it is greater than 8.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than 8, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 8, `s` is 1**
