Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sasha's Strategy:**
   - The solution calculates `s` using a loop where `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations. This approach doesn't accurately model Sasha's betting strategy.
   - The goal is to ensure that Sasha can eventually have any number of coins `n`, given the constraints. The current implementation does not properly simulate the betting process and does not account for the varying bet amounts based on wins and losses.

2. **Strategy to Ensure Sasha Can Have Any Number of Coins:**
   - To ensure Sasha can have any number of coins `n`, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses the maximum allowed number of times (`x` times). After those losses, Sasha should still be able to recover and increase his coin count.
   - A correct approach would involve calculating the minimum number of coins required to recover from `x` consecutive losses and then checking if Sasha can achieve that amount with his initial coins `a`.

### Correct Solution:
Here’s a revised version of the solution that correctly implements the logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of coins required to recover from x consecutive losses
        min_coins_needed = (k ** x - 1) // (k - 1)
        
        # Check if Sasha can have any number of coins n
        if a >= min_coins_needed:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Calculation of Minimum Coins Needed:**
  - The formula `(k ** x - 1) // (k - 1)` calculates the minimum number of coins required to recover from `x` consecutive losses. This is derived from the geometric series sum formula.
  
- **Comparison with Initial Coins:**
  - If Sasha’s initial coins `a` are greater than or equal to the minimum coins needed, Sasha can indeed achieve any number of coins `n`. Otherwise, it is not possible.

This solution correctly models the problem and ensures the logic is sound.
