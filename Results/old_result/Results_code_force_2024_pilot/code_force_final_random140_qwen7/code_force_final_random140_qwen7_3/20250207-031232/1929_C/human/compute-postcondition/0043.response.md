Functionality: **The function processes multiple inputs consisting of integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each set of inputs, it calculates the value of `s` using a specific formula in a loop. If `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated value of `s`, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each set of inputs.**
