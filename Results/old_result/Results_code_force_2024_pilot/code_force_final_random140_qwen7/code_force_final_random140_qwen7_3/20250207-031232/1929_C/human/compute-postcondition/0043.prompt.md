You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than or equal to 15, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 12, `s` is 16.
    #
    #Explanation: Based on the pattern observed, each iteration of the loop increases `i` by 1 and updates `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting from `s = 1`, after 3 iterations, `s` becomes 8. Following this pattern, after 6 iterations, `s` would be 16 (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2), and after 9 iterations, `s` would be 32. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 for each iteration, after 12 iterations, `i` will be 12. For the loop to execute all its iterations, `x` must be at least 15 because `i` starts at 3 and increases by 1 each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but has constraints on variables t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), k (2 ≤ k ≤ 30), x (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9). It does not return any value based on these parameters directly within the function definition provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
