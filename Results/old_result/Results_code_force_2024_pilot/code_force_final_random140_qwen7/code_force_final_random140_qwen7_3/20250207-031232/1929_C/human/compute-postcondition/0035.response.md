Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `x` must be greater than 8.
   - `i` is 9.
   - `s` is \(2 \times (2 // (k - 1)) + 1\).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 9, for the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 9.
   - The value of `k` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `s` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than 9, `i` is 9, `s` is 2 \* (2 // (k - 1)) + 1**
