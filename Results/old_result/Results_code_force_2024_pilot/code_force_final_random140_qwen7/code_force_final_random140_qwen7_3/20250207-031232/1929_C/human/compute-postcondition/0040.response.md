Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than or equal to 16, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 11, `s` is 16.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `x - 1`, which means `i` will be 11 because the loop runs from 0 to `x-1`. The value of `s` will continue to double with each iteration starting from 2, so after 4 iterations (since `i` goes from 3 to 11, which is 4 steps), `s` will be 16. The other variables (`k`, `x`, and `a`) remain as initially described in the precondition since they are not affected by the loop head and body.
