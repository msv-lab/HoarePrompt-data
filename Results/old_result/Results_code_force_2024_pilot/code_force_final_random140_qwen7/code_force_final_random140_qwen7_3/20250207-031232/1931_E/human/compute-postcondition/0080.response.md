Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` will be equal to `int(list_len)`, which means `x` is the integer value of the length of `list_len`.
- `rev_res` is a string constructed by concatenating either the right-stripped version of every element in `operational_list` if its index is even, or the unmodified version if its index is odd.
- `y` will be incremented by the total number of iterations, which is `int(list_len)`.
- `list_len` remains as the first input split by space.
- `max_power` remains as the second input split by space.
- `operational_list` remains a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.
- The length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Anna')
```

This statement directly prints the string "Anna". Since no other variables or objects are being printed, the output is simply the string "Anna".

Output: **Anna**
