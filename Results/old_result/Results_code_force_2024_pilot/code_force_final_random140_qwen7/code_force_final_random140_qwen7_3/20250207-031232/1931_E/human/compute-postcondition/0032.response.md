Output State: **`x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer, `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is `int(input()) + 1`, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of their non-zero trailing digits, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `operational_list` by sorting the input string split by spaces. The sorting key is a lambda function that calculates the difference between the lengths of the string and its version stripped of trailing zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `list_len`, `rev_res`, `y`, `list_len`, or `max_power`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
