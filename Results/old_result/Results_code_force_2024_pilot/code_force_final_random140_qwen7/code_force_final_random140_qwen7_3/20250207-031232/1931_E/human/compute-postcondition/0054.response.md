Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` will be equal to `int(list_len) - 1`
- `rev_res` will be a concatenated string formed by alternating the non-zero trailing digits stripped from `operational_list` elements (if their index `x` is even) and the full elements (if their index `x` is odd)
- The length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Anna'`.

Output: **Anna**
