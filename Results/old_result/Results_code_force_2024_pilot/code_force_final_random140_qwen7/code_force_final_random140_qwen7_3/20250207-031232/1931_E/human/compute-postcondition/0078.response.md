Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` will be equal to `int(list_len)`, where `list_len` is the first input split by space.
- `rev_res` will be a string constructed by concatenating either the right-stripped version of every element in `operational_list` (if its index is even) or the unmodified version (if its index is odd).
- `y` will be incremented by the total number of iterations, which is `int(list_len)`.
- `list_len` will remain as the first input split by space.
- `max_power` will remain as the second input split by space.
- `operational_list` will remain a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.
- The current length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to the sum of `int(max_power)` and 1.

The print statement is simply printing the string "Sasha".

Output: **Sasha**
