Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `x` will be equal to `int(list_len)`, `rev_res` will be a string constructed by concatenating either the right-stripped version of every element in `operational_list` (if its index is even) or the unmodified version (if its index is odd), `y` will be incremented by the total number of iterations (which is `int(list_len)`), `list_len` will remain as the first input split by space, `max_power` will remain as the second input split by space, and `operational_list` will remain a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will have reached the end of the range defined by `int(list_len)`. The variable `rev_res` will contain a concatenated string where each element from `operational_list` is included in the result based on whether its index is even or odd, with even-indexed elements having their trailing zeros removed. The variables `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` will retain their values from the initial state since they are not modified within the loop.
