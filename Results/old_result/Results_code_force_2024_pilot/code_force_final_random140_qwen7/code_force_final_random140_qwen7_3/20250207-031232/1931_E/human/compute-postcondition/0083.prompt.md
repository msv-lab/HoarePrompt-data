Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6; the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = sorted(input().split(), key=lambda x: len(x.rstrip(
        '0')) - len(x))
    for x in range(int(list_len)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
        else:
            rev_res += operational_list[x]
    if len(rev_res) >= int(max_power) + 1:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, `list_len` remains as a string representing a positive integer, and `rev_res` is constructed by concatenating every element of `operational_list` according to the specified rules: if `x` is even, `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` is added; if `x` is odd, `operational_list[x]` is added. The final state of `rev_res` ensures that its length is either greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1` or less than `int(max_power) + 1`, depending on the condition of the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the if-else block executes, `x` will be equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, and `rev_res` will be a concatenated string formed by alternating the non-zero trailing digits stripped from `operational_list` elements (if their index `x` is even) and the full elements (if their index `x` is odd). The length of `rev_res` will be at least `int(max_power) + 1` if the condition `len(rev_res) >= int(max_power) + 1` is true; otherwise, the length of `rev_res` will be less than `int(max_power) + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` will be equal to `int(list_len)`, `rev_res` will be a string constructed by concatenating either the right-stripped version of every element in `operational_list` (if its index is even) or the unmodified version (if its index is odd), `y` will be incremented by the total number of iterations (which is `int(list_len)`), `list_len` will remain as the first input split by space, `max_power` will remain as the second input split by space, and `operational_list` will remain a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros. The final state of `rev_res` will be such that its length is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1` if the if condition is met, otherwise, its length will be less than `int(max_power) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
