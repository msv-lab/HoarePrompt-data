Postcondition: `x` is 2, `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer that must be greater than 2, and `rev_res` is updated as follows: if `x % 2 == 0`, `rev_res` is concatenated with `operational_list[2].rstrip('0')`; otherwise, `rev_res` is updated by adding `operational_list[1].rstrip('0')` to its current value, and then `rev_res` is further updated by adding `operational_list[2]` to it.
