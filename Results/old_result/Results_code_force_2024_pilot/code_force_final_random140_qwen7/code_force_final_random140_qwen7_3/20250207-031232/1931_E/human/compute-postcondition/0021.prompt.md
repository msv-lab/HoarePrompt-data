Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of their numerical part (ignoring trailing zeros), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
    else:
        rev_res += operational_list[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer, and `rev_res` is either equal to `operational_list[0].rstrip('0')` if `x` is even (which it isn't in this case since the precondition states `x` is 0), or `rev_res` is increased by `operational_list[0]` if `x` is not even (which it is, as `x` is 0).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x` is 1, `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer, and `rev_res` is either concatenated with `operational_list[1].rstrip('0')` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `operational_list[1]` added to its current value if `x % 2 != 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is 2, `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer that must be greater than 2, and `rev_res` is updated by concatenating `operational_list[2].rstrip('0')` if `x % 2 == 0`, or by adding `operational_list[2]` to `operational_list[1].rstrip('0')` if `x % 2 != 0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
