Output State: **`x` is `int(list_len) + 1`, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus `operational_list[x]`, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, and `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.**

Explanation: The line `rev_res += operational_list[x]` appends the string at index `x` from the `operational_list` to `rev_res`. Here, `x` is defined as `int(list_len) + 1`, so `operational_list[x]` is the string at the position `int(list_len) + 1` in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
