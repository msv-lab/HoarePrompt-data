Postcondition: **`x` is `int(list_len) + 1`, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with either the stripped trailing zeros of `operational_list[x]` or `operational_list[x]` itself, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, and `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.**
