Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`. Since `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer, `x` will be one less than the length of this integer.
- `rev_res` is constructed by concatenating elements from `operational_list` based on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` is added; if `x` is odd, `operational_list[x]` is added.
- The length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
