Output State: **`x` is `int(list_len) - 1`, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the value of `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed, `operational_list` remains unchanged, `list_len` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet increments `rev_res` by the value of `operational_list[x]` with any trailing zeros removed. Since `x` is initially set to `int(list_len)`, after executing the line, `x` is updated to `int(list_len) - 1`. The value of `rev_res` is updated accordingly, while `operational_list`, `list_len`, and `rev_res` (excluding the added value) remain unchanged.
