You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6; the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `y` will be equal to the total number of test cases (`int(input())`), `rev_res` will be a string constructed by concatenating either the right-stripped version of every element in `operational_list` (if its index is even) or the unmodified version (if its index is odd), `list_len` will remain as the first input split by space, `max_power` will remain as the second input split by space, and `operational_list` will remain a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros. The final state of `rev_res` will be such that its length is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1` if the condition `len(rev_res) >= int(max_power) + 1` is true for all iterations, otherwise, its length will be less than `int(max_power) + 1` for at least one iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two inputs: `list_len` and `max_power`. It then reads a list of strings, sorts this list based on the length of each string after removing trailing zeros, and constructs a new string `rev_res` by alternating between the right-stripped version of even-indexed strings and the unmodified version of odd-indexed strings. Finally, it checks if the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `max_power + 1`. If the condition is met, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the game logic correctly. According to the problem description, Anna and Sasha take turns modifying the list until only one number remains. However, the given program does not simulate the game turns or handle the conditions under which Sasha or Anna wins. Instead, it sorts the list and reverses the digits of alternating elements, which does not reflect the game rules. Specifically, it does not allow Anna to reverse any element or Sasha to concatenate two elements. Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the game and cannot determine the winner based on the given rules.
