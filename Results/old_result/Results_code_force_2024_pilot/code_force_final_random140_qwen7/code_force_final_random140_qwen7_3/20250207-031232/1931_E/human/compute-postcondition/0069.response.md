Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer and is incremented by 1, `rev_res` is a string with the value of `operational_list[x]` stripped of trailing zeros appended to it, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.**

This means that the variable `x` has been incremented by 1, `rev_res` now includes the string from `operational_list` at index `x` with any trailing zeros removed and appended to its current value, while `y` has also been incremented by 1. The values of `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged from their initial states.
