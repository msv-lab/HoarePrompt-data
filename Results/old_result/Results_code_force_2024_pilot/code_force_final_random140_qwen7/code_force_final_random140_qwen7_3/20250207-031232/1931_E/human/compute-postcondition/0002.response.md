Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts using the `split()` function, assigning the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`. Since the input was not specified, we keep the types and conditions of `t`, `y`, and `rev_res` unchanged. The new variables `list_len` and `max_power` are strings containing the split parts of the input.
