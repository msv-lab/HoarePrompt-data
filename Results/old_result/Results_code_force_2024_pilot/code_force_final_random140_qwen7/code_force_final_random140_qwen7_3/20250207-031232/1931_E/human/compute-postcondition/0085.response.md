Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two inputs: `list_len` and `max_power`. It then reads a list of strings, sorts this list based on the length of each string after removing trailing zeros, and constructs a new string `rev_res` by alternating between the right-stripped version of even-indexed strings and the unmodified version of odd-indexed strings. Finally, it checks if the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `max_power + 1`. If the condition is met, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
