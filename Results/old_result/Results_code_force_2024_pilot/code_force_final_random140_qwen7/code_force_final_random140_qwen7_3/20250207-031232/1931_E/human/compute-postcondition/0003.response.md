Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of their numerical part (ignoring trailing zeros), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string.**

Explanation: The code sorts the input list based on the length of the numerical part of each string, ignoring trailing zeros. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
