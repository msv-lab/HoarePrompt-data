Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer.
   - `rev_res` is either equal to `operational_list[0].rstrip('0')` if `x` is even (which it isn't in this case since the precondition states `x` is 0), or `rev_res` is increased by `operational_list[0]` if `x` is not even (which it is, as `x` is 0).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `x` using `range(int(list_len))`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `x` starts from 0, the loop will execute once for `x = 0`.
   - After the first iteration, `x` will be incremented to 1.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `x`.
   - `x` will be incremented by 1 after the first iteration, so `x` will be 1.
   - `list_len` remains unchanged as it is used to define the range but does not change within the loop.
   - `rev_res` remains unchanged as the condition for modifying `rev_res` is based on `x` being even, which is not the case here (since `x` was 0 and now is 1).

5. **Final States:**
   - `x` is now 1.
   - `list_len` remains a string representing a positive integer.
   - `rev_res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`x` is 1, `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer, and `rev_res` remains unchanged**.
