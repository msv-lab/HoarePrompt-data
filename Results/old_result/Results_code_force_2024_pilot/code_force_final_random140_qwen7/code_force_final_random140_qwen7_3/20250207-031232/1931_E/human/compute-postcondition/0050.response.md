Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `x` will be equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, and `rev_res` will be a concatenated string formed by alternating the non-zero trailing digits stripped from `operational_list` elements (if their index `x` is even) and the full elements (if their index `x` is odd).**

This means that `rev_res` will contain a sequence where every even index position in the loop contributes the part of the corresponding `operational_list` element without its trailing zeros, and every odd index position contributes the entire element. The final value of `x` will be `int(list_len) - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
