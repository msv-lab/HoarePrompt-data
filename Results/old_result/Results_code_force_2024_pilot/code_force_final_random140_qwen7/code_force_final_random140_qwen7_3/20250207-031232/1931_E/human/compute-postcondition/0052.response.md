Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` will be equal to `int(list_len) - 1`. This means `x` is the length of `list_len` minus one.
- `rev_res` is a concatenated string formed by alternating the non-zero trailing digits stripped from `operational_list` elements (if their index `x` is even) and the full elements (if their index `x` is odd).
- The length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`.

However, the `print` statement only outputs the string `'Sasha'`.

Therefore, the output is simply the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
