Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer (incremented by 1); `rev_res` is a string with `operational_list[x]` appended; `y` is incremented by 1; `list_len` is the first input split by space; `max_power` is the second input split by space; `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.**

Explanation: The code appends `operational_list[x]` to `rev_res`. Since `x` is a non-negative integer and has been incremented by 1, it now points to the next element in the `operational_list`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
