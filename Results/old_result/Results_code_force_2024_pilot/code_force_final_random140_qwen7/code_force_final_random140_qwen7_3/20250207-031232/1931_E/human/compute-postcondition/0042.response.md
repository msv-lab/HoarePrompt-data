Output State: **`x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, `rev_res` is increased by `operational_list[x]`**.

Explanation: The code `rev_res += operational_list[x]` increments `rev_res` by the value of `operational_list[x]`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. Therefore, `x` is still equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, and `rev_res` is now increased by the value of `operational_list[x]`.
