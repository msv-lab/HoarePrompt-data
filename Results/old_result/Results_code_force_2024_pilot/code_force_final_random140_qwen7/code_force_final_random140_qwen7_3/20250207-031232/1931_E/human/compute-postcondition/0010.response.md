Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `list_len` is a string representing a positive integer, and `rev_res` is either equal to `operational_list[0].rstrip('0')` if `x` is even (which it isn't in this case since the precondition states `x` is 0), or `rev_res` is increased by `operational_list[0]` if `x` is not even (which it is, as `x` is 0).
