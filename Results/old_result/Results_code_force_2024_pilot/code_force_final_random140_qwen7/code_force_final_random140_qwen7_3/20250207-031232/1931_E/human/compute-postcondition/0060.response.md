Output State: **`x` is `int(list_len) - 1`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.**

Explanation: The code takes two inputs, splits them by spaces, and stores them in `list_len` and `max_power`. It then takes another input, splits it by spaces, and sorts the resulting list of strings based on the length of each string after removing any trailing zeros. The sorting key is a lambda function that calculates the length of the string after removing trailing zeros. The variables `x`, `rev_res`, `y`, `list_len`, and `max_power` retain their previous values or remain unchanged except for `operational_list`, which is updated to the sorted list.
