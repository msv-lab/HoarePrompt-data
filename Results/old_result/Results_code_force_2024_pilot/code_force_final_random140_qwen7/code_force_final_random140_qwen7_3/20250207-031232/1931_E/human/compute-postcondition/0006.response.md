Output State: **`x` is 0, `list_len` is a string that must represent a positive integer, and `rev_res` is equal to `operational_list[0].rstrip('0')`**

Explanation: The code updates the `rev_res` variable by adding the result of `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` to it. Given that `x` is initially 0, `rev_res` will now hold the value of `operational_list[0]` with all trailing zeros removed. The values of `x` and `list_len` remain unchanged from their initial states.
