Output State: **`x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1` - 1, and `rev_res` is increased by `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` increments `rev_res` by the value of `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed. The value of `x` is updated to `int(list_len) - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `int(list_len) - 2`. The value of `rev_res` is now increased by `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
