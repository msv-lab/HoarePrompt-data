Postcondition: `x` is a non-negative integer, `rev_res` is a string, `y` is incremented by 1, `list_len` is the first input split by space, `max_power` is the second input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of the string after removing trailing zeros. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the right stripped version of `operational_list[x]` to it. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is set to the string from `operational_list` at index `x`.
