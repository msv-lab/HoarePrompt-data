Output State: **`rev_res` has increased by `operational_list[x]`, `x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1` and is odd.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += operational_list[x]` increments the value of `rev_res` by `operational_list[x]`. Given that `x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1` and is odd, the updated state of `x` remains unchanged, but `rev_res` now includes the addition of `operational_list[x]`.
