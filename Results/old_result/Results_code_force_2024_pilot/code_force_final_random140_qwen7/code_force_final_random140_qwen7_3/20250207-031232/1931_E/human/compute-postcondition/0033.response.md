Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for x in range(int(list_len)):`. The variables involved here are `x` and `int(list_len)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `x` and `int(list_len)`**:
   - From the given state, `x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`.
   - `int(list_len)` is a string representing a positive integer, which means it is an integer value when converted.

3. **Understand the Range Function**: The `range(int(list_len))` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to but not including `int(list_len)`. For the loop to execute, `int(list_len)` must be at least 1 (since `range(0)` would generate no numbers).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `x` is initially set to `int(list_len) - 1`, the loop will start with `x` being one less than `int(list_len)`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `int(list_len)` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `int(list_len)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is equal to `int(list_len) - 1`, `int(list_len)` must be greater than or equal to 1**
