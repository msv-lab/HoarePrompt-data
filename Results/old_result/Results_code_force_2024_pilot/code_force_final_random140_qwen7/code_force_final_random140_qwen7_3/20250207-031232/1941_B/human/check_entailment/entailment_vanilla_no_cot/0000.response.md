Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Here are the key problems:

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The `answers` list is used to store the results but is not defined within the scope of the functions. This will cause a NameError when running the code.

2. **Loop Termination Condition**: The loop in `func_3` runs up to 100 iterations, which is arbitrary and might not be sufficient in some cases. It should run until the array is either reduced to all zeros or it becomes clear that it cannot be made all zeros.

3. **Operation Application Logic**: The logic for selecting the index with the highest value and applying the operation might not always lead to a solution. In some cases, it might be necessary to apply the operation to different indices to achieve the goal.

4. **Edge Cases**: The current implementation does not handle edge cases well, such as arrays where the sum of the elements is odd, making it impossible to reduce all elements to zero.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the array elements is even because each operation reduces the sum by 3. Additionally, we need to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros through the specified operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] -= 1
    array[index] -= 2
    array[index + 1] -= 1
    return array

def func_2(array):
    return all(x == 0 for x in array)

def func_3(inputarray):
    if sum(inputarray) % 3 != 0:
        return 'NO'
    
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter <= 1000:  # Increased the loop limit to a higher value
        length = len(inputarray)
        highestNumber = -1
        highestIndex = -1
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        
        if highestNumber < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        if func_2(newArray):
            return 'YES'
        
        inputarray = newArray
        loop_counter += 1
    
    return 'NO'

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    inputarray = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_3(inputarray))
```

This corrected version checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and then iteratively applies the operation to try to reduce the array to all zeros.
