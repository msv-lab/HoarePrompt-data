Output State: `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `length` is greater than `length - 2`, and `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, with `highestNumber` being the highest value itself.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `elementIndex` will be one less than the length of `inputarray`, meaning it will point to the second-to-last element of the array. The variable `length` remains unchanged from its initial value. `highestIndex` will hold the index of the highest value found in `inputarray` during the loop's execution, and `highestNumber` will store that highest value.
