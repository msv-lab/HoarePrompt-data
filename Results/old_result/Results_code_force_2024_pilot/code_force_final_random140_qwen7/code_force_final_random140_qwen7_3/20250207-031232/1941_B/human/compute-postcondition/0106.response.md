Output State: `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, `highestNumber` is the highest value itself, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments, `loop_counter` is 100, and `answers` list does not contain 'YES' or 'NO'.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `loop_counter` reaches 100), the loop condition `loop_counter != 100` becomes false, and the loop terminates. At this point, `elementIndex` will be set to `length - 2` because the loop increments `loop_counter` after each iteration and stops when `loop_counter` equals 100. The values of `highestIndex`, `highestNumber`, and `newArray` will reflect the results of the last iteration of the loop. Since the loop does not append 'YES' or 'NO' to the `answers` list and `func_2(newArray)` returned `False` in the previous iteration, the `answers` list remains unchanged.
