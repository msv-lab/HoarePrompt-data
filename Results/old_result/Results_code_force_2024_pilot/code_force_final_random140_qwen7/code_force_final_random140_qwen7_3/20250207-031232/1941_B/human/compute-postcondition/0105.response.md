Output State: **`elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, `highestNumber` is the highest value itself, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments, and `loop_counter` is incremented by 1, `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**

The code increments the `loop_counter` by 1, but does not affect the values of `elementIndex`, `highestIndex`, `highestNumber`, `newArray`, or the return value of `func_2(newArray)`.
