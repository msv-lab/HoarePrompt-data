Output State: **`elementIndex` is 97, `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is -1, `highestNumber` is -1, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

Explanation: The line `highestIndex = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
