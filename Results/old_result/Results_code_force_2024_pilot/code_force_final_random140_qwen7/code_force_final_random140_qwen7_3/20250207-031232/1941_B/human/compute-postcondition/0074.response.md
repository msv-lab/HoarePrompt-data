Output State: **`elementIndex` is 97, `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `highestNumber` is -1.**

The code sets `highestNumber` to -1, which overrides its previous value (which was the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97). All other variables remain unchanged.
