Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is greater than 98, and `highestIndex` is 98**.

Explanation: The code sets `highestIndex` to the value of `elementIndex`, which is 98. The values of `elementIndex` and `length` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the assignment. Since `highestIndex` was previously 97 if `inputarray[97]` was greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, and now it is set to 98, the new condition for `highestIndex` is 98.
