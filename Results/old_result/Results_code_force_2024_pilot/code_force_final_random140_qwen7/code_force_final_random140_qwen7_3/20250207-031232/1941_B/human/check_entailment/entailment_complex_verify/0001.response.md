### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the annotated code and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly performs the specified operation on the array.
- It takes an array and an index `i`, and modifies the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
- The function returns the modified array.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function correctly checks if all elements in the array are zero.
- It iterates through the array and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function attempts to make all elements of the input array zero using the operations defined in `func_1`.
- It initializes a list `answers` to store the results for each test case.
- It first checks if the array is already zero using `func_2`. If so, it appends 'YES' to `answers` and returns.
- If not, it enters a loop where it finds the highest value in the array (excluding the first and last elements) and applies `func_1` to reduce this value.
- It continues this process up to 100 iterations.
- If after 100 iterations, the array is still not all zeros, it appends 'NO' to `answers` and returns.

#### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The initial check using `func_2` is correct. If the array is already zero, the answer should be 'YES'.

2. **Finding the Highest Value**:
   - The logic to find the highest value in the array (excluding the first and last elements) is correct. This ensures that the largest value is targeted first, which is a good strategy for reducing the array values.

3. **Applying the Operation**:
   - The application of `func_1` to reduce the highest value is correct. This operation is designed to reduce the values in a way that could potentially lead to all elements becoming zero.

4. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop terminates after 100 iterations. While this is a reasonable limit to prevent infinite loops, it is not theoretically necessary. In practice, if the array can be reduced to zero, it will happen within a smaller number of steps.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, another check using `func_2` is performed to see if the array is now all zeros. If so, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program handles arrays with all zeros correctly.
- The program handles arrays where no operation can reduce the values to zero correctly.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_3`:
- The function assumes that the highest value will always be reducible in a way that leads to all elements being zero. This is not always true.
- For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. The highest value is 1, and applying the operation will not reduce the array to zero because the operation requires at least two elements to be reduced by 2, which is not possible here.

Given this, the function `func_3` might not correctly identify all cases where the array can be reduced to zero.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations in all cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
