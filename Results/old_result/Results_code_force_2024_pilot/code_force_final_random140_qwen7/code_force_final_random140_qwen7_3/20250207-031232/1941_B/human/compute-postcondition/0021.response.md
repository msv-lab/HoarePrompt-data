Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head defines the variables that change during each iteration. In this case, the loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`. The variable being changed is `elementIndex`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `elementIndex` is 2
   - `highestNumber` remains unchanged (either `inputarray[2]` or the original `highestNumber`)
   - `highestIndex` is 2

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop starts from `elementIndex = 1` and ends just before `length - 1`. Therefore, the loop will increment `elementIndex` by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Calculate the Next Value of `elementIndex`**: Since `elementIndex` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Thus, `elementIndex` will be 3 in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to update the state to reflect the new value of `elementIndex`. The values of `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` remains unchanged (either `inputarray[2]` or the original `highestNumber`), and `highestIndex` is 2**
