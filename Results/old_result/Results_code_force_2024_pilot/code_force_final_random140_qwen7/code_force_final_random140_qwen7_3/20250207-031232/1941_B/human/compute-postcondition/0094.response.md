Postcondition: `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `length` is greater than `length - 2`, and `highestIndex` is the index where the highest value in `inputarray` was found during the loop's execution, with `highestNumber` being the highest value itself, and the current value of `highestNumber` is less than 0.
