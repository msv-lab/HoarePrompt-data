Output State: **`elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` remains unchanged, `highestIndex` is 3**

Explanation: The code `highestIndex = elementIndex` assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 3) to `highestIndex`. The value of `elementIndex` remains 3, and `highestNumber` remains unchanged as per the initial state.
