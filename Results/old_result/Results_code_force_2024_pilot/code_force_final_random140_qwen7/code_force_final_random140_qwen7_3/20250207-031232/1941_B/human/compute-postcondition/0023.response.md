Output State: **`elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` is inputarray[3], `highestIndex` is 3**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` is set to the value at index 3 of the `inputarray`. The value of `elementIndex` remains unchanged, and `highestIndex` also remains 3.
