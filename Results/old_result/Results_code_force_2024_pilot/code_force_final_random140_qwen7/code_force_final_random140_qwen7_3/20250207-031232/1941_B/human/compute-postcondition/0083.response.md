Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables that are used in the loop. In this case, the loop is iterating over `elementIndex` using `range(1, length - 1)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `elementIndex` is within the range specified by `range(1, length - 1)`. This means `elementIndex` should be between 1 and `length - 2` (inclusive).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` is 97.
   - `length` is greater than 98.
   - `highestIndex` is 97 if `inputarray[97]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`. Otherwise, it remains 97.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 97.
   - Since `length` is greater than 98, the new `elementIndex` will be 98, which is still within the range `1` to `length - 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `elementIndex` will be incremented to 98.
   - `length` remains unchanged and is still greater than 98.
   - `highestIndex` remains unchanged unless `inputarray[98]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is greater than 98, and `highestIndex` is 97 if `inputarray[97]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`. If `inputarray[97]` is less than `highestNumber`, the values of `elementIndex`, `length`, and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.**
