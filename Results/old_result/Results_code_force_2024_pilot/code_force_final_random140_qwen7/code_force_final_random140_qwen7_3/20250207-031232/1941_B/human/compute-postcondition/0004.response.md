Output State: **`loop_counter` is 1**.

The initial state tells us that `inputarray` is a list of integers with a specific length and range for its elements, and the function `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. The code snippet only initializes `loop_counter` to `1`, which does not depend on the value of `inputarray` or the return value of `func_2(inputarray)`. Therefore, the only change is that `loop_counter` is set to `1`. All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
