You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

#Function 1:
def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2
    array[index + 1] = array[index + 1] - 1
    return array

#Function 2:
def func_2(arrayForSuccess):
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
    return True

    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        highestNumber = -1
        highestIndex = -1
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        loop_counter += 1
    answers.append('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `inputarray` and may return 'YES' if certain conditions are met during its execution. If these conditions are not met, the function does not return any value. Specifically, the function iterates through the list, identifies the highest number and its index, and modifies the list based on this information. It then checks if the modified list satisfies a condition using `func_2`. If `func_2` returns 'YES', the function appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If the loop completes 100 iterations without finding a suitable modification, the function appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. If `func_2` never returns 'YES' within the loop, the function also appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. In cases where the function does not return a value, it indicates that none of the conditions were satisfied.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Specifically, the `func_3` function does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here's a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. According to the problem description, we need to check if it's possible to make all elements zero using the specified operations. However, the current implementation does not account for all necessary conditions to determine if such a transformation is possible.

One key issue is that the function only checks the highest value in the array and applies the operation to it repeatedly until it finds an array where all elements are zero or determines that it's impossible. This approach is flawed because it doesn't ensure that the operations can be applied in a way that eventually makes all elements zero.

For instance, in the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, applying the operation to the highest value (5) multiple times might not lead to a situation where all elements become zero. A more comprehensive approach would involve checking if the sum of the array is divisible by 3, which is a necessary condition for making all elements zero using the given operations.

Since the provided code does not handle this critical condition and fails to correctly determine if the array can be transformed into all zeros, the program is incorrect.
