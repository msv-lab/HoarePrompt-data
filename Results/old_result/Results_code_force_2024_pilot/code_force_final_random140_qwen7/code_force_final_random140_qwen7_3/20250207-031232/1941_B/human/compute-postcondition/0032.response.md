Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the largest element in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

Explanation: The code creates a new array `newArray` by calling the function `func_1` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments. The values of `elementIndex`, `length`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `newArray` variable is now assigned the result of the function call, which could be a modified version of `inputarray` depending on what `func_1` does.
