Output State: `elementIndex` is 97, `length` is greater than 98, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to 97, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` with the updated `highestIndex`, and `loop_counter` is 100.

Explanation: After the loop completes all 97 iterations (from `elementIndex` 1 to 97), `elementIndex` will be 97. The loop updates `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` whenever it finds a value in `inputarray` that is greater than or equal to the current `highestNumber`. Therefore, `highestIndex` will be the index of the maximum value in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, and `highestNumber` will be the maximum value itself. The state of `newArray` and `loop_counter` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
