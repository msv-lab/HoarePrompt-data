Output State: **`elementIndex` is 2, `length` is greater than 2, and `highestIndex` is 2, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value among `inputarray[1]` and the current `highestNumber`.**

Explanation: The line `highestIndex = elementIndex` assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 2) to `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `highestIndex` is now 2, while `elementIndex`, `length`, and `highestNumber` retain their original conditions.
