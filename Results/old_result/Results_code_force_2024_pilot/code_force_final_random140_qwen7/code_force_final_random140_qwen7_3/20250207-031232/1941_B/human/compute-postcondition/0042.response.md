Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`. The variables involved here are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `elementIndex` is initially set to 98.
   - `length` is given as `len(inputarray)`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `1 <= elementIndex < length - 1`. Given that `elementIndex` starts at 98, we need to check if this value falls within the range defined by `length`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `elementIndex` should be set to 1 (the smallest possible value for the loop to execute).
   - `length` should be such that `1 <= 1 < length - 1` holds true. This means `length` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `elementIndex` and `length`.

**Final State**:
- `elementIndex` is 1.
- `length` must be greater than 2.

So, the final state is:
State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `length` must be greater than 2**
