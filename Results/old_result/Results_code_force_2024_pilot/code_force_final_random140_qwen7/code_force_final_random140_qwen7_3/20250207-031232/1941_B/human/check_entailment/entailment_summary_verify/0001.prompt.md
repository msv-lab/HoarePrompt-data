You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2

        highestIndex = -1
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]

            return
        loop_counter += 1
    answers.append('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `inputarray` and may return 'YES' if certain conditions are met during its execution. If these conditions are not met, the function does not return any value. Specifically, the function iterates through the list, identifies the highest number and its index, and modifies the list based on this information. It then checks if the modified list satisfies a condition using `func_2`. If `func_2` returns 'YES', the function appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If the loop completes 100 iterations without finding a suitable modification, the function appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. If `func_2` never returns 'YES' within the loop, the function also appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. In cases where the function does not return a value, it indicates that none of the conditions were satisfied.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs the specified operation on the array.
   - It takes an array and an index `i`, and modifies the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
   - The function returns the modified array.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It iterates through the array and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the input array zero using the operations defined in `func_1`.
   - It initializes a list `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - It first checks if the array is already zero using `func_2`. If so, it appends 'YES' to `answers` and returns.
   - If not, it enters a loop where it finds the highest value in the array (excluding the first and last elements) and applies `func_1` to reduce this value.
   - It continues this process up to 100 iterations.
   - If after 100 iterations, the array is still not all zeros, it appends 'NO' to `answers` and returns.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The initial check using `func_2` is correct. If the array is already zero, the answer should be 'YES'.

2. **Finding the Highest Value**:
   - The logic to find the highest value in the array (excluding the first and last elements) is correct. This ensures that the largest value is targeted first, which is a good strategy for reducing the array values.

3. **Applying the Operation**:
   - The application of `func_1` to reduce the highest value is correct. This operation is designed to reduce the values in a way that could potentially lead to all elements becoming zero.

4. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop terminates after 100 iterations. While this is a reasonable limit to prevent infinite loops, it is not theoretically necessary. In practice, if the array can be reduced to zero, it will happen within a smaller number of steps.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, another check using `func_2` is performed to see if the array is now all zeros. If so, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles arrays with all zeros correctly.
- The program handles arrays where no operation can reduce the values to zero correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The only potential issue is the arbitrary limit of 100 iterations, but in practice, this limit is sufficient for most cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
