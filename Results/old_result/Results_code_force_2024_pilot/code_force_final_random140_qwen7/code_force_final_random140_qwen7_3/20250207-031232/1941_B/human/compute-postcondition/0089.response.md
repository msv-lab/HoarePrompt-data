Output State: **`elementIndex` is 99, `length` is greater than 99, `highestIndex` is 99, and `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[99]`**.

Explanation: The code sets `highestIndex` to the value of `elementIndex`, which was 99. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `highestIndex` is now 99, and `highestNumber` remains the value of `inputarray[98]` since no change was made to `highestNumber`.
