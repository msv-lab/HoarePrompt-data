Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is len(inputarray), `highestIndex` is -1, `highestNumber` is -1, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is 100**

Explanation: The code sets `highestIndex` to -1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `elementIndex`, `length`, `highestNumber`, `newArray`, and `loop_counter` retain their original values.
