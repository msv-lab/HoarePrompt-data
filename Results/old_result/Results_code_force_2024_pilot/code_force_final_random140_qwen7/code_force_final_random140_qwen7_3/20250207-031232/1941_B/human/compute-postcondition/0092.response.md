Output State: `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `length` is greater than `length - 2`, and `highestIndex` is the index where the maximum value in `inputarray` is found, with `highestNumber` being that maximum value.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `elementIndex` will be one less than the length of `inputarray`, meaning it will be at the second-to-last index. The `length` variable remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The `highestIndex` will be the index of the highest number found in the `inputarray`, and `highestNumber` will hold that highest value.
