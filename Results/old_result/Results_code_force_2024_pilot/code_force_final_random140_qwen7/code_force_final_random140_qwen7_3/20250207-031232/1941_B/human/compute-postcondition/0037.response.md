`loop_counter` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`elementIndex`, `length`, `highestIndex`, `highestNumber`, `newArray`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the largest element in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is increased by 1.
