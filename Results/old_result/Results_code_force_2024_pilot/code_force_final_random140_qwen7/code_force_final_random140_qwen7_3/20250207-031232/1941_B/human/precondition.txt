array is a list of integers with length n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), where each element a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, and index is an integer such that 2 ≤ index ≤ n - 1. Additionally, the input consists of multiple test cases, each described by the number of elements in the array (t test cases in total, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by the array elements for each test case.
