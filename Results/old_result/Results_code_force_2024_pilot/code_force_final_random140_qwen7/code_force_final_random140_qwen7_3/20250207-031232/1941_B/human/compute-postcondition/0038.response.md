The loop condition is `while loop_counter != 100:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `loop_counter` is not equal to 100. At the end of the previous iteration, `loop_counter` has been increased by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `loop_counter` must be less than 100. Since `loop_counter` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it must have been 99 before the increment. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `loop_counter` must be set to 100.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 100, `highestIndex` is the index of the largest element in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray `inputarray[1:98]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is 100**
