Output State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[elementIndex]`, `highestIndex` is 1**

Explanation: The code sets `highestNumber` to the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. Since `elementIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is now set to `inputarray[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
