Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` where `i` is 4, `y` is the integer part of `a[2]` or `a[3]` divided by 10, `n` is either 2 or 3, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]`, `i` is 4, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]`**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(a[i] % 10)` updates the value of `x` to be the last digit of the integer at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is 4, `x` is now the last digit of `a[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
