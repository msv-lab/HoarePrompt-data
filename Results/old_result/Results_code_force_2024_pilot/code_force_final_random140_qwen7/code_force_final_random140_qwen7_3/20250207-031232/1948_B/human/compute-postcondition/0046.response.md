Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[0]` if `a[0] > 10`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list containing either the last digit of `a[0]` or the first element of `a`, `i` is 0.**
