The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it constructs a new list `c` based on specific conditions involving the digits of the numbers in `a`. It then sorts `c` and checks if `c` is equal to its sorted version. If `c` is equal to its sorted version, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function ultimately returns the list `b`, which contains either `0` or `1` for each test case.
