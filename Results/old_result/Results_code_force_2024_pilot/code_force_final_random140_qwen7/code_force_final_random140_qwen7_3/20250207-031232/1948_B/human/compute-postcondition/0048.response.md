Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10 if `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list containing either the last digit of `a[i]` or the value of `y` appended with `x` if `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, otherwise `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[0]` or the first element of `a`, `i` is 0.
