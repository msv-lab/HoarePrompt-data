### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually. This is evident from the nested loops and the function calls.

2. **Array Processing**: The function `func_1()` processes each test case by:
   - Reading the size `k` of the array and the array itself.
   - Splitting the array into individual digits and processing them according to the rules.
   - Storing the processed array in `c`.

3. **Sorting Check**: After processing, the function checks if the processed array `c` is sorted. If it is, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

4. **Output Generation**: The main loop outside the function prints `YES` or `NO` based on the values in `b`.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Logic for Processing Digits**: The logic for splitting and processing the digits is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the merging of digits when the condition `y >= c[n - 1]` is met. It should ensure that the new digits are inserted in the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order.

- **Incorrect Handling of Single-Digit Numbers**: The code does not handle single-digit numbers correctly. Single-digit numbers should be directly added to the result without modification.

- **Incorrect Length Calculation**: The variable `n` is used incorrectly. It should not be incremented in a way that doubles the length of the array.

Given these issues, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting digits as described in the problem statement.
