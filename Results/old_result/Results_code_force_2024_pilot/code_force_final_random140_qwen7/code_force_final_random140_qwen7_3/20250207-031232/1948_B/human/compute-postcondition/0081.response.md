Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[4]` divided by 10, `n` is either 3 or 4, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` plus the last digit of `a[4]` if `y <= x`, otherwise `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]`, `i` is 4, `y` is now equal to `int(a[4] / 10)`**.
