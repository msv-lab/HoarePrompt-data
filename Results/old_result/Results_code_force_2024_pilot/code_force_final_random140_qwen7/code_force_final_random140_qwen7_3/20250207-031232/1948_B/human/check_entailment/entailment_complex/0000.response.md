Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the splitting of digits from numbers greater than 10 and reinserting them into the array.
2. The function `func_1()` processes the array `a` but does not properly simulate the operation described in the problem statement. Instead of splitting and reinserting digits, it seems to be trying to sort the array directly after some transformation, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
3. The variable `b` is used to store results for each test case, but the logic inside `func_1()` does not correctly determine if the array can be made sorted through the allowed operations.
4. The program reads multiple test cases but only processes one test case per iteration of the outer loop, which is incorrect since it should process all test cases.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
