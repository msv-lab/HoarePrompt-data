Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `n` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list, `i` is 0, the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 10, and `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then `n` is 2 and `c` contains `y` appended with `x`; otherwise, `n` is 1 and `c` contains the element `a[i]`.
