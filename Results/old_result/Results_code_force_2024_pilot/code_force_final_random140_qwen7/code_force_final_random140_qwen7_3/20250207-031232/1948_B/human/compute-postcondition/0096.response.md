Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` depending on the condition, `y` is the integer part of `a[2]` or `a[3]` divided by 10, `n` is 3, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]`, `i` is 5, `c` appended with `a[5]` if `i` is not 0 and `a[i]` is not greater than 10. Otherwise, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `y` is the last digit of `a[4]`, `n` is either 3 or 4, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` and the last digit of `a[4]`, `i` is 4.
