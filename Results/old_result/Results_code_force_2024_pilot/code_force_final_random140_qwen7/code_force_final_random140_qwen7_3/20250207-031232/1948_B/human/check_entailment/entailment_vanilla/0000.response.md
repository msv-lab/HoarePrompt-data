Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `m` (the number of test cases) from the input.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs `m` times, but the function `func_1()` is called only once inside this loop. This is incorrect because it should process each test case individually.
   - The loop should iterate over each test case and call `func_1()` for that specific test case.

3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function processes one test case.
   - It reads `k` (the length of the array) and the array `a` from the input.
   - It converts the string representation of the array into a list of integers.
   - It processes the array to check if it can be made sorted by splitting elements greater than 10.
   - It uses a list `c` to store the processed elements and checks if `c` is sorted.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.
   - However, the main loop that calls `func_1()` is incorrect as explained above.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
m = int(input())
b = []

for i in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = input().strip().split()
    a = list(map(int, a))
    
    c = []
    n = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n += 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n += 1
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n += 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n += 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n += 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n += 1
    
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error in the main loop where it calls `func_1()` only once instead of processing each test case individually. After fixing this, the program should work correctly.

**Correctness: True**
