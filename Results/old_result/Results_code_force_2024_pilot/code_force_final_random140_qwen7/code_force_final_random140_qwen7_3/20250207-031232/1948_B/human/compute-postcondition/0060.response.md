Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[3]` if `a[3] > 10` and `1 > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[2]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[3]` divided by 10, `n` is 3, `c` is a list containing the last element of `a` (which is `a[2]` since `i` is now 3), `i` is 3.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `y >= c[n - 1]` is true, then `t`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` are updated according to the if part's rules. If the condition is false, then they are updated according to the else part's rules.
