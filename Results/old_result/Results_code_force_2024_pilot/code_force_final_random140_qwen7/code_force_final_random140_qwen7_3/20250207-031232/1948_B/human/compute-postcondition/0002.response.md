Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` splits the string `a` into parts based on spaces and then converts each part into an integer. The resulting values are stored in a list, which replaces the original string `a`. The variables `t` and `k` remain unchanged.
