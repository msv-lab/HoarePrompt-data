Output State: **`c` is a list containing 0 and the last digit of `a[0]`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `i` is 0.**

The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` (which is the last digit of `a[0]`) to the list `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
