Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `n` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list containing either the element `a[i]` or the value of `y` appended with `x`, `i` is 0, the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 10, and `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, with `y` being greater than or equal to the last element of `c` if `n` is 2, otherwise `y` is 0 and `c` contains the value of `a[i]`.
