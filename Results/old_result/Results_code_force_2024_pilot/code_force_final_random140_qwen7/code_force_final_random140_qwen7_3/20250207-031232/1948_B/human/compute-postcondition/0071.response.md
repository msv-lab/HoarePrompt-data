Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i-1]` where `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `n` is either 2 or 3, `c` is a list containing the appropriate elements as per the condition, `i` is 3 if the condition `i == 0 and a[i] > 10` is true, otherwise `i` is 2.**
