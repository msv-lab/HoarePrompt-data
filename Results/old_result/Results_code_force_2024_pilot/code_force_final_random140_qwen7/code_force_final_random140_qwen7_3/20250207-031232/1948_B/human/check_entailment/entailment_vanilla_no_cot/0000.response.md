Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Initialization of `b` List**: The list `b` is initialized outside the loop but not properly reset for each test case. This means that `b` retains values from previous test cases, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` Function**: The logic for splitting numbers into their constituent digits and checking if the resulting array is sorted is flawed. Specifically:
   - The condition `if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:` should handle only those elements greater than 10, but the logic inside does not correctly manage the sorting and appending of digits.
   - The variable `n` is used incorrectly to track the size of the list `c`, and the comparison logic between `y` and `x` and `c[n-1]` is not appropriate for ensuring the array remains sorted.

3. **Input Handling**: The input handling in `func_1` is not correctly splitting the string input into a list of integers. It should directly convert the input string to integers without splitting.

4. **Output Logic**: The output logic checks if the list `c` is sorted but does not correctly handle the transformation process.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
m = int(input())
b = []

for i in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    def split_and_sort(arr):
        c = []
        for num in arr:
            if num > 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
                c.extend(digits)
            else:
                c.append(num)
        return sorted(c)
    
    sorted_arr = split_and_sort(a)
    if sorted_arr == a:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)

for res in b:
    if res == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version initializes `b` for each test case, correctly handles the input, and ensures the array is transformed and checked for being sorted.
