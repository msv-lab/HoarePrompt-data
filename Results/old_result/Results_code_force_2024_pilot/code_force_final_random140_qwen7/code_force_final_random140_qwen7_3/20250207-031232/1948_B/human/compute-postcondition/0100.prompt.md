Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10 if `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list containing either the last digit of `a[i]` or the value of `y` appended with `x` if `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, otherwise `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[0]` or the first element of `a`, `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` depending on the condition, `y` is the integer part of `a[2]` or `a[3]` divided by 10, `n` is either 2 or 3, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]`, `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last digit of `a[4]` if `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]` depending on the condition, `y` is the integer part of `a[2]` or `a[3]` divided by 10, `n` is 3 or 4, `c` is a list containing the last digit of `a[2]` or `a[3]`, `i` is 4 or 5, and `c` is appended with `a[5]` if `i` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
