Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the variable `ams` is defined inside the loop but never used, and the logic to update `ans` to reflect the minimum number of cards after performing the operations is incomplete.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The variable `ams` is defined but not used in the context of updating the answer.
2. The logic to reduce the count of cards when a group of `k` cards can be replaced with `k-1` cards is missing.
3. The final value of `ans` is not updated based on the actual minimum number of cards that can be achieved.

To fix this, you need to keep track of the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the operations. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        h = {}
        for i in a:
            if i in h:
                h[i] += 1
            else:
                h[i] = 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
        ans = 0
        for count in h.values():
            ans += (count // k) * (k - 1)
            if count % k != 0:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the operations.
