Postcondition: `ans` is `k - 1`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `h` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second element of the list `a`. If the second element of the list `a` was already in the dictionary `h` before the if-else block executes and its value is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, then the value of `h[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `h[i]` is set to 1.
