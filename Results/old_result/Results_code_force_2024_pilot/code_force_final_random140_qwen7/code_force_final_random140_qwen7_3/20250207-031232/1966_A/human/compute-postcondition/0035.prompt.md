Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `h[i]` remains unchanged and `ams` is `k - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is assigned the value 1, and `h[i]` is now 1, with `ams` being `k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, and `h[i]` is either incremented by 1 if `i` is in `h`, or set to 1 if `i` is not in `h`; if `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is `k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements (since it lost one element), `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `ams` is either `k - 1` if `h[i]` was incremented by 1 and was already greater than or equal to `k`, or remains unchanged if `h[i]` was set to 1 or was already less than `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
