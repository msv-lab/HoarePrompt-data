Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `i` is the next element from the list `a`; `h[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In this case, the code `h[i] += 1` increments the value of `h[i]` by 1, where `i` is the next element from the list `a`. The initial state of `a` and `i` remains unchanged, but `h[i]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value.
