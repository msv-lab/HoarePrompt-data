Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, and `h[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In this case, the code `h[i] += 1` increments the value of `h[i]` by 1. Since the initial state only mentions `a` and `i`, and does not specify the contents of `h`, we can only state that `h[i]` has been incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
