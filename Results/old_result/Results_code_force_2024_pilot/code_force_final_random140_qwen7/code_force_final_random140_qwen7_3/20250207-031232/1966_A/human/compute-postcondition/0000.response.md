Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Range of Values**: The value of the dummy variable `_` will be determined by `int(input())`. This means that the number of iterations of the loop will depend on the input provided by the user.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state given is:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 100\).
   - A list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards is provided for each test case, where each integer is in the range \(1 \leq c_i \leq 100\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop will run based on the input from the user, the state that needs to be adjusted is the one that ensures the loop can execute. In this case, it is the value of `t` because the loop will run `t` times.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be a positive integer (since `int(input())` will return a positive integer).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer**
