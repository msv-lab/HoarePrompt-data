Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, and `h[i]` is either incremented by 1 if `i` is in `h`, or set to 1 if `i` is not in `h`; `ams` is `k - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ams = k - 1` assigns the value of `k - 1` to the variable `ams`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `i`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
