Postcondition: `ans` is `n`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `h` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element of the list `a` and the value is incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether the first element of the list `a` was already in the dictionary `h` before the if-else block executes, and the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.
