Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, and if `i` is found in `h`, the value of `h[i]` is increased by 1. If `i` is not initially in `h`, then `i` is added to `h` with the value 1. If the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is `k - 1`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.
