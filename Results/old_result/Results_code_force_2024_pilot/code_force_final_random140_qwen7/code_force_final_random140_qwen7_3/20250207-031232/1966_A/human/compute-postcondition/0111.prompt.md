Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. Additionally, a list of n integers representing the numbers on the cards is provided for each test case, where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    h = {}
    ans = n
    for i in a:
        if i in h:
            h[i] += 1
        else:
            h[i] = 1
        if h[i] >= k:
            ams = k - 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in the list `a` have been processed, and for each unique element `i` in `a`, `h[i]` contains the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`. If any `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is set to `k - 1`. The variable `ans` retains its initial value `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ans` is `k - 1`, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is an empty list of integers, and `h` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where each key is an integer from the original list `a` and each value is either `k + 1` (if the count of that integer in `a` was exactly `k`) or greater than `k` (if the count of that integer in `a` was more than `k`).

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, all elements in the list `a` will have been processed. For each unique integer in `a`, the dictionary `h` will contain an entry with the integer as the key and the count of occurrences of that integer as the value. If the count of any integer is exactly `k`, its corresponding value in `h` will be `k + 1`. If the count is more than `k`, the value will be greater than `k`. The variable `ans` remains `k - 1` because it is updated only when the condition `h[i] >= k` is met, which happens at most once per unique integer in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `a` will be an empty list, `ans` will still be `n`, `h` will be a dictionary containing the count of each integer from the original list `a`, and `ams` will be `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears `k` or more times in `h`; otherwise, `ams` will remain `None` (or its initial value, which is not specified but can be assumed to be `None` if not explicitly changed).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
