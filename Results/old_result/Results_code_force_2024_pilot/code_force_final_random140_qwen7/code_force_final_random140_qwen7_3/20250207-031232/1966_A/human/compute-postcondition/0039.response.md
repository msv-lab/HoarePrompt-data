Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the first input value, `k` is an integer representing the second input value, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
