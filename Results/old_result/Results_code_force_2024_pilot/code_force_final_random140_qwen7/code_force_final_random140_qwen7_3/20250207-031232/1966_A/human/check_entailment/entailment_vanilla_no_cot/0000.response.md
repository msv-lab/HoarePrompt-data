Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, but it is not updated correctly based on the operations. The logic inside the loop where `h[i]` is checked and `ams` is set to `k - 1` is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain.

2. **Misunderstanding of Operations**: The program does not properly account for the fact that we can reduce the count of any group of `k` identical cards to `k-1` cards. It should keep track of how many groups of `k` or more cards can be reduced and then calculate the final count of cards accordingly.

3. **Incomplete Logic**: The program does not handle the reduction of counts effectively. It should check for groups of `k` or more cards and reduce their counts appropriately, updating `ans` based on these reductions.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        h = {}
        for i in a:
            if i in h:
                h[i] += 1
            else:
                h[i] = 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards remaining
        ans = 0
        for count in h.values():
            ans += count % k
        
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: We count the occurrences of each card type using a dictionary `h`.
2. **Calculating Remaining Cards**: For each count in the dictionary, we add the remainder when divided by `k` to `ans`. This ensures that we only count the cards that cannot form a full group of `k`.

This approach correctly calculates the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations.
