Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers n and k, and a list of n integers representing the numbers on the cards. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (the number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers n and k, and a list of n integers. It then performs some operation based on these inputs and returns the result for each test case.
