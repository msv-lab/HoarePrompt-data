Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the value `p`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `p`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` must be less than `p`.
   - `S` is increased by the third element of the list obtained from splitting the input string.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `p`. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1` and must still satisfy the condition `i < p`.
   - The value of `S` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are specified for `S` within the loop.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `S` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is less than `p`, `S` is increased by the third element of the list obtained from splitting the input string**.

To explicitly state the updated values:
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `S` remains the same.

So, the final state can be written as:
State: **`i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `p`, `S` is increased by the third element of the list obtained from splitting the input string**.
