Output State: `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces added `p` times, `i` is `p + 1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `T` remains greater than 0, `n` and `k` remain as the initial input integers, `p` must be at least 1, and `S` will be the sum of the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces, repeated `p` times. The loop variable `i` will be `p + 1`.
