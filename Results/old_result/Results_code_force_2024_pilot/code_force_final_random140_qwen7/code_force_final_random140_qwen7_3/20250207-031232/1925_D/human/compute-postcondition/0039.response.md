Output State: **`num` is equal to `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `g` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `i` is equal to `p`, `S` is the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2 * p - 1`, `den` is equal to the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `den` by calculating its modular multiplicative inverse modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`num`, `g`, `i`, `S`) remain unchanged. The new value of `den` is derived from the original `den` value using the `pow` function with the exponent `-1` and the modulus `MOD`.
