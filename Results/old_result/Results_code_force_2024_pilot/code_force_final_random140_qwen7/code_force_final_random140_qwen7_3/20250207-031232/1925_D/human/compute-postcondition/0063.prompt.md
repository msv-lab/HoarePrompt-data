Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 50000; `MOD` is 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, p, k = map(int, input().split())
    S = 0
    for i in range(p):
        S += int(input().split()[2])
    C = n * (n - 1) // 2
    num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
    den = 2 * C * C
    g = math.gcd(num, den)
    num = num // g
    den = den // g
    den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
    ans = num * den % MOD
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces added `p` times, `i` is `p + 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `den` is simplified by dividing both `num` and `den` by their greatest common divisor `g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is equal to `num * den % MOD`, `g` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `i` is equal to `p`, `S` is the sum of the third elements of the input strings for each iteration of the loop from `p + 1` to `2 * p - 1`, `den` is equal to the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 0, `S` is the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C // g`, `den` is now `den // g` and `den` is raised to the power -1 modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
