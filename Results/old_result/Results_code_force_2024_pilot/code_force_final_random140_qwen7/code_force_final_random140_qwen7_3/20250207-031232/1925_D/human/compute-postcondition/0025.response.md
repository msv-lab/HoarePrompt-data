Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(p)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `p`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `p + 1`.
   - `p` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < p`. Since `i` starts at `p + 1`, the loop will not execute because `p + 1` is not less than `p`.

4. **Adjust the state to allow the loop to execute**: To make the loop execute, we need to adjust the value of `i` so that it is less than `p`. The simplest way to do this is to set `i` to `0` or any value less than `p`.

Given the above analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `p`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` should be less than `p`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` must be less than `p`**.
