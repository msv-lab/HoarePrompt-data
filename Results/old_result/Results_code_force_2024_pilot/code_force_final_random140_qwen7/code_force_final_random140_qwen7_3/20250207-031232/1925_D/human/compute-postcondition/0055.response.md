Output State: **`i` is 0, `S` is the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value `2 * C * C` to the variable `den`. The other variables (`i`, `S`, `C`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
