Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program calculates the numerator and denominator incorrectly without considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends. 

The program assumes that the friendship value increases linearly based on the number of excursions, but it does not account for the probability of selecting each pair in each excursion. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each pair and then summing these expectations.

Here's a brief outline of the correct approach:
1. For each pair of friends, calculate the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions.
2. Sum these expected values for all pairs of friends.
3. Ensure the result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The given program does not implement this logic correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
