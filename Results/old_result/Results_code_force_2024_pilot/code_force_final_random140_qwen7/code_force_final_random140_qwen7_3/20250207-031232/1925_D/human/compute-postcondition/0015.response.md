Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces added `p` times, `i` is `p + 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `2 * C * C` to the variable `den`. Since `C` is defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is calculated as `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
