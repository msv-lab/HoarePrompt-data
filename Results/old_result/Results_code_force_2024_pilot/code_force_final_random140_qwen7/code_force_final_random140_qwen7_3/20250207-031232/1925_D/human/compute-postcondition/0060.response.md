Output State: **`i` is 0, `S` is the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C // g`, `den` is now `den // g` and `den` is raised to the power -1 modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `ans` as `num * den % MOD`. The values of `i`, `S`, `C`, `num`, `den`, and `den` (raised to the power -1 modulo `MOD`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `ans` is the result of the calculation using the updated `num` and `den`.
