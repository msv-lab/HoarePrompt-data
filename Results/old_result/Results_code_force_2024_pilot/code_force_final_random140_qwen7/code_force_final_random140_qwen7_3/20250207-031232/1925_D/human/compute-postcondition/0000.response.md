Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007.**

The code snippet sets the constant `MOD` to 1000000007. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, `b_i`, or `f_i`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the value to `MOD`. The other variables retain their initial conditions specified in the initial state.
