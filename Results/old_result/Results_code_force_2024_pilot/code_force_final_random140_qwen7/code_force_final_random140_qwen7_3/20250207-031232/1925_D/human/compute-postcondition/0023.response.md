Output State: **`T` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces added `p` times, `i` is `p + 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `den` is simplified by dividing both `num` and `den` by their greatest common divisor `g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is not yet calculated**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `p`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. It does not directly assign these values to any variables, but it sets up the context for subsequent operations. The values of `T`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `g`, `num`, `den`, and `ans` remain as described in the initial state, except that `num` and `den` are now defined in terms of `p`, `k`, and `C`. The modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD` has not been calculated yet, and `ans` remains undefined.
