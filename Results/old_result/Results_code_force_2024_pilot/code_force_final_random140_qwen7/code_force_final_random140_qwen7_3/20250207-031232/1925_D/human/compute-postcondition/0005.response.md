Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(p)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `p`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head; it will start from 0 by default.
   - `p` is given as an input integer.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `p` is greater than or equal to 1 (since `range(p)` will generate numbers from 0 to `p-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `p` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will be adjusted during the loop execution, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it starts from 0 by default.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `p` (it must be greater than or equal to 1).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is 0**
