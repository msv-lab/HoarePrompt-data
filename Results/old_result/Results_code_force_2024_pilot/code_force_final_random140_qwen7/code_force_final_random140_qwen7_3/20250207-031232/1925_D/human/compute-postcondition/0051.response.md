Output State: `i` is `0`, `S` is the sum of its initial value (0) and the sum of the third element from the input split into an integer for each of the `p` iterations.

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `i` becomes `0` (as it starts from `p` and decreases by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`), and `S` is the sum of the initial value of `S` (which is `0`) plus the third element from the input split into an integer, repeated `p` times.
