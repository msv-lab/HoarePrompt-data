Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces added `p` times, `i` is `p + 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `num` using the given formula. The value of `num` depends on the values of `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`. Since `C` is already defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, and `S` is defined as the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces added `p` times, these values remain unchanged. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `i`) are not affected by the calculation of `num`.
