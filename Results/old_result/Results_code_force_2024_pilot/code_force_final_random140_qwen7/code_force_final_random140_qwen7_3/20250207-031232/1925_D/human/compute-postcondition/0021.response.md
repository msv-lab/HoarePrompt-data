Let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `T` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `p` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `S` is the integer value of the third element from the input split by spaces, added `p` times.
   - `i` is `p + 1`.
   - `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.
   - `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`.
   - `den` is `2 * C * C`.
   - `den` is simplified by dividing both `num` and `den` by their greatest common divisor `g`.
   - `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`.
   - `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `S` is derived from the third element of the input split by spaces, repeated `p` times.
   - `C` is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, i.e., combinations of `n` taken 2 at a time.
   - `num` and `den` are derived from the formula involving `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`.
   - `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.
   - `den` is then simplified and made the modular multiplicative inverse of itself modulo `MOD`.
   - `ans` is the result of multiplying `num` by the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.

3. **Final Computation**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the result of the complex mathematical operations described above.

Given the complexity and the abstract nature of the problem, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `p`, `k`, and the third element of the input split by spaces. However, the structure and the steps involved in calculating `ans` are clear.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of num * den % MOD after simplifying num and den and finding the modular multiplicative inverse of den modulo MOD)**
