You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, p, k) = map(int, input().split())
        S = 0
        for i in range(p):
            S += int(input().split()[2])
        C = n * (n - 1) // 2
        num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
        den = 2 * C * C
        g = math.gcd(num, den)
        num = num // g
        den = den // g
        den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
        ans = num * den % MOD
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers \( n \), \( p \), and \( k \). It also processes additional lines of data for each test case, each containing integers \( a_i \), \( b_i \), and \( f_i \). For each test case, the function calculates a value based on the given inputs and arithmetic operations, including the computation of sums, gcd, and modular arithmetic. The final result, \( ans \), is printed for each test case, representing the outcome of the specified formula, adjusted for the given constraints and modulo \( 1000000007 \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - `MOD` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The number of test cases `T` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   
2. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - A variable `S` is initialized to 0.
   - For each of the `m` pairs, the friendship value `f_i` is added to `S`.

3. **Total Possible Pairs Calculation:**
   - `C` is calculated as \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), which represents the total number of unique pairs of children.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The numerator `num` is calculated as \(p \times k \times k - p \times k + 2 \times k \times C \times S\).
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as \(2 \times C \times C\).
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den` is computed using `math.gcd`.
   - Both `num` and `den` are divided by the GCD to simplify the fraction.
   - `den` is then inverted modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.
   - Finally, the result is computed as `num * den % MOD` and printed.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The sum `S` of friendship values is correctly accumulated from the input.

2. **Total Number of Pairs:**
   - The calculation of `C` as \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) is correct.

3. **Expected Value Formula:**
   - The formula used to compute the expected value seems to be derived from the problem statement, but let's verify the logic:
     - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be derived from the probability of picking a friend pair and the increase in friendship value.
     - The formula \(p \times k \times k - p \times k + 2 \times k \times C \times S\) seems to account for the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.

4. **GCD and Modulo Inversion:**
   - The use of GCD to simplify the fraction and then inverting the denominator modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is correct for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Final Computation:**
   - The final computation `num * den % MOD` is correct for obtaining the result in the required format.

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the correct approach and logic to solve the problem as described.
