Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `p`.
   - `S` is increased by the integer value of the third element from the input string split by spaces.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(p):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `p`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `p`.
   - This means that before the current iteration, `i` was `i + 1 - 1 = i`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i < p` must still hold true.
   - The value of `S` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted and no additional operations are specified.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `S` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1 + 1` and must be less than `p`, `S` is increased by the integer value of the third element from the input string split by spaces.**
