Output State: **`i` is `p`, `S` is the sum of its previous value and the third element from the input split into an integer plus the third element from the input split into an integer**.

This means that `S` has been updated by adding the third element from the input (after splitting the input by spaces and converting it to an integer) to its previous value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially `p`.
