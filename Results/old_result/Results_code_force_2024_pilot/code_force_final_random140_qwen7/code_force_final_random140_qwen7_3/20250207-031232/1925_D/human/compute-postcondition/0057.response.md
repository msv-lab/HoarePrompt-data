Output State: **`i` is 0, `S` is the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`**.

Explanation: The code `num = num // g` divides `num` by the greatest common divisor `g` of `num` and `den`. The other variables (`i`, `S`, `C`, `den`, and `g`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `num` is `num // g`.
