Output State: **`i` is 0, `S` is the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den` is used to divide `den`, so `den` is now `den // g`.**

Explanation: The code `den = den // g` divides the value of `den` by the greatest common divisor `g` of `num` and `den`. This updates the value of `den` to its simplified form, but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `S`, `C`, `num`, and `g` remain unchanged.
