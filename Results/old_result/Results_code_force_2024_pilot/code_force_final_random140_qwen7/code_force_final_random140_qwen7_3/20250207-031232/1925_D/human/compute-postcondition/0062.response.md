Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is the final value of `ans` computed after processing all inputs according to the given logic. Specifically, `ans` is calculated as follows:

1. For each test case (`T`), initialize `S` as the sum of the third elements from the input strings for each iteration from `0` to `p-1`.
2. Calculate `C` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
3. Compute `num` as `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, where `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.
4. Compute `den` as `2 * C * C // g`, then simplify `den` by dividing both `num` and `den` by their greatest common divisor `g`.
5. Find the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD` and store it in `den`.
6. Finally, compute `ans` as `num * den % MOD`.

After processing all test cases, the output state will be a list of `ans` values, one for each test case, with each `ans` being the result of the described computation.
