Output State: **`i` must be less than `p`; `S` is increased by the third element of the list obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings, and adds the third element (index 2) of this list, converted to an integer, to the variable `S`. The conditions on `i` being less than `p` remain unchanged, and the value of `S` is updated accordingly.
