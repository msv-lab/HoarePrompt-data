Output State: **`i` is 0, `S` is the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `num` using the formula `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`. The values of `i`, `S`, and `C` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `num` is computed based on the given formula, incorporating the values of `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`.
