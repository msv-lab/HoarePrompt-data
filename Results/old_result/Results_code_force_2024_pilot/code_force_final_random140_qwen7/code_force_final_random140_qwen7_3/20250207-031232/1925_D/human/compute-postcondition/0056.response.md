Output State: **`i` is 0, `S` is the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`**.

The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `num` and `den` and assigns it to the variable `g`. The other variables (`i`, `S`, `C`, `num`, and `den`) remain unchanged.
