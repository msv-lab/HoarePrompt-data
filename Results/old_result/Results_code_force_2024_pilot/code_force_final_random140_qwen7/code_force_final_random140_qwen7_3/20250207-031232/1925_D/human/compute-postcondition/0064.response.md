Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t, followed by n, m, and k, which are integers with specific constraints. Additionally, it processes m lines of data for each test case, each containing integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. The function does not return a value but processes the input data according to the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each starting with an integer t that indicates the number of test cases to follow. Each test case involves processing three integers n, m, and k, along with m lines of additional data (a_i, b_i, f_i) representing friendships with associated values. The function validates the input against specified constraints and processes the data accordingly without returning any value.
