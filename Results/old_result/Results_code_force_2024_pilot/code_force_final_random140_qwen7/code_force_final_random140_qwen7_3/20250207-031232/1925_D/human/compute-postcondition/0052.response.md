Output State: `i` is `0`, `S` is the sum of its initial value (0) and the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `0` because it starts at `p` and decreases by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variable `S` will be the sum of all the third elements from the input split into integers for each of the `p` iterations of the loop.
