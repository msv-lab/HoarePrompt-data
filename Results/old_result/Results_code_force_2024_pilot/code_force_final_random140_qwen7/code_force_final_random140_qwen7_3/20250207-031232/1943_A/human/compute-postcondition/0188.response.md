Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each index from 0 to `n` in the list `a`. It then determines and prints the smallest index `j` (starting from 1) where the count of `j` in `a` is less than 2. If `cntl[0]` is still 0 after processing all inputs, it prints 0. If no such `j` is found, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.**
