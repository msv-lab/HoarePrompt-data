Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
   - `i` is the first element of `a`.
   - `a` must have at least one element.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `a` using `for i in a`.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is the first element of `a`, after the loop starts, `i` will be the second element of `a` (assuming `a` has at least two elements).
   - `a` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

5. **Updating the State:**
   - `cntl[i]` is already updated in the previous iteration.
   - `i` will now be the second element of `a`.
   - `a` must still have at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is the second element of `a`, `a` must have at least one element**
