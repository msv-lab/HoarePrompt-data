Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.

3. **Handling Zero:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0`. This is correct because if there are no zeros in the array, the MEX will be `0`.

4. **Calculating MEX:**
   - The program calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the optimal strategy of both players.
   - The program then iterates through the counts from `1` to `n` and checks if the count is less than `2`. If so, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` becomes `0`. If `c` becomes `0`, it prints the current index `j`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX:**
   - The program's logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. It does not consider the optimal moves of both players.
   - The program should simulate the optimal moves of both players to determine the final MEX.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented:**
   - The program does not implement the optimal strategy where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.
   - The program's logic does not account for the turns and the strategic placement of elements in `c`.

### Correct Solution Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the optimal moves of both players:

1. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice should always pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX.

2. **Bob's Turn:**
   - Bob should always pick the smallest available element to minimize the MEX.

3. **Track Picked Elements:**
   - Use a set to track the elements picked by Alice and Bob.
   - Determine the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set.

### Corrected Program

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Track picked elements
        picked = set()
        
        # Alice's turn
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                picked.add(a[i])
            else:  # Bob's turn
                picked.add(a[i])
        
        # Calculate MEX
        mex = 0
        while mex in picked:
            mex += 1
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not simulate the optimal moves of both players. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
