Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the object `a`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` contains at least one element.
   - `i` is the first element of `a`.

3. **Determine the changes for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first element of `a`, and `a` contains at least one element, the loop can continue as long as `a` still contains elements.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `a` (since it was the first element in the previous iteration).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `cntl[i]` will be incremented by 1 again for the new value of `i`.
   - `a` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `i` will now be the second element of `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` contains at least one element, and `i` is the second element of `a`**.
