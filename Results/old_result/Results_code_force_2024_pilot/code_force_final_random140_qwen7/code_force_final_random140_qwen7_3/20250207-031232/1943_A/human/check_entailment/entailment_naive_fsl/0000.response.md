Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains duplicate elements that could affect the MEX value. Specifically, the program assumes that the optimal strategy involves Alice and Bob always picking elements to minimize or maximize the MEX value respectively, but it does not fully account for the interaction between the counts of different elements.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

The output of the program for this test case is `2`, but let's analyze the optimal play:

- Alice starts by picking either `0` or `1`. Suppose she picks `0`.
- Now `a = [0, 1]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob will pick `0` to minimize the MEX, so `a = [1]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice will then pick `1`, making `a = []` and `c = [0, 1]`.

Here, the MEX of `c = [0, 1]` is `2`. However, the program incorrectly calculates the MEX as `2` instead of considering the optimal moves by both players.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the optimal strategy for both players, which is more complex than just counting the occurrences of each element. The current implementation does not fully capture the strategic aspect of the game, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
