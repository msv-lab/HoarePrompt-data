Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or remains unchanged, and `c` is `c - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `c` before the operation is not specified. Therefore, the new value of `c` is `c - 1`. The values of `j`, `n`, and `cntl[2]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
