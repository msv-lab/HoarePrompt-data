You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    if cntl[j] == 0:
                        print(j)
                        break
                    else:
                        c -= 1
                        if not c:
                            print(j)
                            break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each index from 0 to `n` in the list `a`. It then determines and prints the smallest index `j` (starting from 1) where the count of `j` in `a` is less than 2. If `cntl[0]` is still 0 after processing all inputs, it prints 0. If no such `j` is found, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.

3. **Handling Zero:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0`. This is correct because if there are no zeros in the array, the MEX will be `0`.

4. **Calculating MEX:**
   - The program calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the optimal strategy of both players.
   - The program then iterates through the counts from `1` to `n` and checks if the count is less than `2`. If so, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` becomes `0`. If `c` becomes `0`, it prints the current index `j`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX:**
   - The program's logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. It does not consider the optimal moves of both players.
   - The program should simulate the optimal moves of both players to determine the final MEX.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented:**
   - The program does not implement the optimal strategy where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.
   - The program's logic does not account for the turns and the strategic placement of elements in `c`.

### Correct Solution Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the optimal moves of both players:

1. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice should always pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX.

2. **Bob's Turn:**
   - Bob should always pick the smallest available element to minimize the MEX.

3. **Track Picked Elements:**
   - Use a set to track the elements picked by Alice and Bob.
   - Determine the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set.

### Corrected Program

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Track picked elements
        picked = set()
        
        # Alice's turn
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                picked.add(a[i])
            else:  # Bob's turn
                picked.add(a[i])
        
        # Calculate MEX
        mex = 0
        while mex in picked:
            mex += 1
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

The given program is incorrect because it does not simulate the optimal moves of both players. Therefore, the correct answer is:
