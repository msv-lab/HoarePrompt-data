Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is equal to the number of times its index appears in the list `a`. The list `a` contains no more than `n` elements, and all elements in `a` are within the range of 0 to `n`. If `cntl[0]` was 0, it remains 0. After processing all elements in `a`, `j` equals `n`, `c` equals 0, and `cntl[j]` reflects the correct count of index appearances.**
