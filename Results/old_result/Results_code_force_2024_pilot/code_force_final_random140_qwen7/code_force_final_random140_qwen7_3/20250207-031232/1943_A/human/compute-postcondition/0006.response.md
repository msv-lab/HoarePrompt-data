Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The variable `i` takes on each value from the list `a` in sequence.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, meaning that `i` is an element from the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is an element from the list `a`, after processing one element, `i` will take the next element from the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must still have at least one element left to process.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` must still have at least one element (since it had at least one element before and we just processed one).
   - `cntl[i]` will be increased by 1 again, where `i` is now the next element from the list `a`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, where `i` is the next element from the list `a`**.
