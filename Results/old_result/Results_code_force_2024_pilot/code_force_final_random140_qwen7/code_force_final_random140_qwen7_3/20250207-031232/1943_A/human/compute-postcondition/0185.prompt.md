Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                if cntl[j] == 0:
                    print(j)
                    break
                else:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c:
                        print(j)
                        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the if-else block executes, the variable `cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index appearing in the list `a`. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0, and `cntl[j]` (where `j` is `n`) is a valid value representing the count of `n` in `a`. Additionally, `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[n]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `cntl` is updated such that each element `cntl[i]` (where `i` is an integer from the list `a`) is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`. The list `a` is empty, and `c` retains its initial value of either 0 or -1 based on the initial state of `cntl[n]`. If `cntl[0] == 0`, then `cntl[0]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cntl[2]` remains unchanged or has been decremented by up to 2 depending on its initial value and the occurrences of 2 in the list `a`, and `c` remains unchanged or has been decremented by up to 2 depending on its initial value and the conditions within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cntl` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is equal to the number of times its index appears in the list `a`. The list `a` contains no more than `n` elements, and all elements in `a` are within the range of 0 to `n`. If `cntl[0]` was 0, it remains 0. After processing all elements in `a`, `j` equals `n`, `c` equals 0, and `cntl[j]` reflects the correct count of index appearances.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
