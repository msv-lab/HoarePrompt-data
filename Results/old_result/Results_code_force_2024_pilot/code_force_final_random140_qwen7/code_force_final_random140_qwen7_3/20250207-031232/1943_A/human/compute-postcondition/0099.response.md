Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that the condition `cntl[2]` was checking. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition about `cntl[2]` being either `cntl[2] - 1` or less than 2 is still valid.
