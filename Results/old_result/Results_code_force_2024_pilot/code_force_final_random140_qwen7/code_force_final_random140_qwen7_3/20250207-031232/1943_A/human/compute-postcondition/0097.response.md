Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`, and the range of the loop is from 1 to `n + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - The current value of `cntl[j]` is either `cntl[j] - 1` or less than 2. If `cntl[j]` was 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 2.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be 2
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 (since `n` does not change within the loop)

6. **Adjust the state of `cntl[j]`**:
   - The current value of `cntl[j]` (where `j` is 1) is either `cntl[1] - 1` or less than 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `cntl[2]` must also follow the same rule. However, since we are starting a new iteration with `j = 2`, the value of `cntl[1]` is no longer relevant for this iteration.

7. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be 2
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - The current value of `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or less than 2. If `cntl[2]` was 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and the current value of `cntl[2]` is either `cntl[2] - 1` or less than 2. If `cntl[2]` was 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
