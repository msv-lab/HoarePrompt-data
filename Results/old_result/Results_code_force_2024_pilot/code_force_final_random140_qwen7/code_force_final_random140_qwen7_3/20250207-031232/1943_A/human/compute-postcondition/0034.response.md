Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. The loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2 (since `j` is 1, this means `cntl[1]` is less than 2)
   - `c` is 0

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, after the increment, `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a loop control variable and does not change within the loop.
   - `cntl[j]` will now be `cntl[2]`, but the problem does not specify the value of `cntl[2]`, only that `cntl[1]` is less than 2. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about `cntl[2]` other than it being a valid value for the array.
   - `c` remains 0 as per the postcondition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j` and the unchanged values of `n`, `cntl[j]`, and `c`.

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `cntl[2]` is a valid value (not specified), `c` is 0**.
