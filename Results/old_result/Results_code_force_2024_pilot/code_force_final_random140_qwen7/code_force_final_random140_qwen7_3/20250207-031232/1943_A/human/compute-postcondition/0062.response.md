Output State: **`cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index appearing in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is 0, `cntl[j]` (where `j` is `n`) is a valid value representing the count of `n` in `a`, and `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[n]`, and the input value is reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the values of `cntl`, `c`, or the initial condition that `cntl[0]` is 0 and `cntl[j]` (where `j` is `n`) is a valid value representing the count of `n` in `a`. Additionally, it mentions that the input value is reduced by 1, which means `n` itself is the new value after reduction.
