Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `cntl[j]` is less than 1 and `c` is false. If `cntl[j]` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cntl[j]` is less than 1 and `c` is false, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
