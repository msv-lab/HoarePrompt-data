Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 1 (since the range is from 1 to `n + 1`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, `j` must be initialized to 1 and should increment within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `j` should be set to 1.
   - The value of `n` should be such that the loop can execute. This means `n` must be a non-negative integer because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.

5. **Consider Other Variables**: The other variables (`a`, `cntl`, and `c`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be a non-negative integer**
