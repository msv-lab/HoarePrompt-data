Output State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` contains at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the first element of `a`, and `a` must contain at least one element, these conditions remain true after the execution of the code.
