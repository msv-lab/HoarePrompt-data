Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, and `c`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it breaks out of the context implied by the initial conditions and the nature of the `break` statement.
