Output State: `cntl` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is equal to the number of times its index appears in the list `a`. The list `a` must contain no more than `n` elements, and all elements in `a` must be within the range of 0 to `n`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cntl` list will show how many times each index (from 0 to `n`) appears as an element in the input list `a`. If an index does not appear in `a`, its corresponding element in `cntl` will remain 0. The loop continues until all elements in `a` have been processed, thus updating `cntl` accordingly.
