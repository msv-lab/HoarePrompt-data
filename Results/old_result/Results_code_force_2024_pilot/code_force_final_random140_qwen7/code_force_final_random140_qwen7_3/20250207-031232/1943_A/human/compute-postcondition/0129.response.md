Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
   - `i` is the first element of `a`.
   - `a` must have at least one element.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must still have at least one element.
   - `i` will be set to the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is the first element of `a` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in `a` will be used for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming `a` is a list of integers or similar).
   - `a` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `i` will be the second element of `a`.
- `a` must still have at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is the second element of `a`, `a` must have at least one element**
