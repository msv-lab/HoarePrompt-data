Output State: All elements in `cntl` are incremented based on the occurrences of their indices in the list `a`. Specifically, if an index `i` appears `k` times in `a`, then `cntl[i]` will be `k`.

Explanation: Since the loop runs for every element in `a`, each index present in `a` will increment its corresponding position in `cntl` exactly as many times as it appears in `a`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `cntl` will reflect the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`.
