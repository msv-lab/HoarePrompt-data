Output State: **`cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, and `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[n]`, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cntl` as a list of `n+1` elements, where each element is set to 0. The value of `c` remains unchanged and is either 0 or -1 based on the value of `cntl[n]`, which is 0 after this initialization. The list `a` remains unchanged as it was before this code execution.
