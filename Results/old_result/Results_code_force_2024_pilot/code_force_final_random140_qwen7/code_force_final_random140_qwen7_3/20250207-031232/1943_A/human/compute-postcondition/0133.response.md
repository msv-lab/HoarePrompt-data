Output State: **`cntl[i]` is updated to its previous value plus 1, `i` is the third element of `a`, `a` must have at least two elements**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1, where `i` is the third element of `a`. The precondition that `a` must have at least two elements remains valid. The value of `i` is unchanged and still refers to the third element of `a`. The value of `cntl[i]` is updated to its previous value plus 1.
