Output State: The variable `a` is a list of integers, and `cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index appearing in the list `a`. After the loop has executed all iterations, `cntl[i]` for each `i` in `a` will be the total number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `cntl[i]` will hold the frequency count of each integer `i` found in the list `a`.
