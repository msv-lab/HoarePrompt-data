Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4.
