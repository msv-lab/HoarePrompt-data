Postcondition: **The list `cntl` is updated such that each element `cntl[i]` (where `i` is an integer from the list `a`) is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`. The list `a` is empty, and `c` retains its initial value of either 0 or -1 based on the initial state of `cntl[n]`. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.**
