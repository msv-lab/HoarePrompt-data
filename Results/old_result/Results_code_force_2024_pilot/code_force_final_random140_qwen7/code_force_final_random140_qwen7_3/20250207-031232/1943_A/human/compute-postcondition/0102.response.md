Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `cntl[2]` is `cntl[2] - 1`, and `c` is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c`. It only indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
