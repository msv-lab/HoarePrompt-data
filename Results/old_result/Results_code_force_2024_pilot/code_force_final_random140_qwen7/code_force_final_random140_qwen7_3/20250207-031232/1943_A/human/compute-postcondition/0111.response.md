Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `cntl[2]` remains unchanged, and `c` remains unchanged.**

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a nested structure. In this case, since there is no loop or nested structure mentioned in the initial state, the variables `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain unchanged.
