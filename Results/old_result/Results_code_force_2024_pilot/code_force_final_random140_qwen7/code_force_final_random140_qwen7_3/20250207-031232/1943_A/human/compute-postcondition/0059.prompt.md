Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index appearing in the list `a`, and `c` is 2 if `cntl[0]` is less than or equal to 2, otherwise `c` is `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Additionally, `c` is 0. If `c` is not 0, the program continues without changing these conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `cntl[2]` is a valid value, and `c` is either 0 (if `cntl[2]` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or -1 (if `cntl[2]` is not 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `cntl[2]` is a valid value, and `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[2]`, with the condition that either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
