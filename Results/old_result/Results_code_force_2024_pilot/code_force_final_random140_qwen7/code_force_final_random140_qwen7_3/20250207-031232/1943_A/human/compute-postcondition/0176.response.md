Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `n` is mentioned to be greater than 0 but no specific value is provided.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 1, but since `j` is 3, this does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `c` is initially false and then decreased by 1, making it `False - 1`, which in Python would result in `False` (since boolean operations do not change the boolean type to an integer).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement only contains `j`, which is explicitly given as 3.

Output: **3**
