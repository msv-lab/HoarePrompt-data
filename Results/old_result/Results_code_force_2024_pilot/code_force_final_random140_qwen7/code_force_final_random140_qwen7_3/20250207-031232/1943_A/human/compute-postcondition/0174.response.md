Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, since `j` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 0 before the `break` statement was encountered, these conditions remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not modify the values of any variables, so `cntl[j]` and `c` retain their previous conditions (less than 1 and false, respectively), but the context now includes that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
