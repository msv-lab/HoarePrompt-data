Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `n` is a non-negative integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is explicitly defined as 0, but since the print statement only references `j`, this value is not relevant to the output.

The print statement `print(j)` will simply output the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
