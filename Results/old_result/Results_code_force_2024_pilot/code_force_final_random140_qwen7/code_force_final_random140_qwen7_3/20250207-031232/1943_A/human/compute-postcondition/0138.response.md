Based on the initial state provided:

- `cntl` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is equal to the number of times its index appears in the list `a`.
- The list `a` contains no more than `n` elements.
- All elements in `a` are within the range of 0 to `n`.
- The first element of `cntl` (i.e., `cntl[0]`) is 0 because the condition `cntl[0] == 0` is true.

The print statement simply outputs the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
