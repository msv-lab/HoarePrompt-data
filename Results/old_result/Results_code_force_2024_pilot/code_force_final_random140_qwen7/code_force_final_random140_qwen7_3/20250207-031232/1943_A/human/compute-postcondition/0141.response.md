Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the condition `range(1, n + 1)`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is equal to the number of times its index appears in the list `a`.
   - The first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not equal to 0.
   - `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop starts with `j` set to 1 and increments `j` until `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must start from 1 and `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop goes up to `n`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1, we need to ensure `j` is 1 initially.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `cntl`, `a`, and `c` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
