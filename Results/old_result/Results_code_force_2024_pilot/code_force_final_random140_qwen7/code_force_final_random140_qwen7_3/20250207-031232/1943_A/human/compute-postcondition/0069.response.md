Output State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` contains at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `a`**.

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The conditions for the next iteration of the loop (`a` containing at least one element and `i` being the first element of `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `cntl[i]` and the unchanged conditions for the loop.
