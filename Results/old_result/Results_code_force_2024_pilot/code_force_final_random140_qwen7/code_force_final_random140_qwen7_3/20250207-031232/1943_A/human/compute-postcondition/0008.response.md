Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: 
   - `i` is the next element from the list `a`.
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1 during each iteration.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, where `i` is the next element from the list `a`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element from the list `a`, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the current iteration, `i` was the next element from `a`, and `cntl[i]` was incremented. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `a`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The list `a` must still have at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element from `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the next element from the list `a`**.
