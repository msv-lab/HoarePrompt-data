Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `cntl[2]` is a valid value, `c` is equal to -1**

Explanation: The initial value of `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[2]`. After executing `c -= 1`, if `c` was initially 0, it will become -1. If `c` was already -1, it remains unchanged. The other variables (`j`, `n`, and `cntl[2]`) are not affected by this operation.
