Output State: **`cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index appearing in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is 0, `cntl[j]` (where `j` is `n`) is a valid value representing the count of `n` in `a`, and `c` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `cntl[n]`, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not modify the existing variables `cntl`, `c`, or the value of `n`. Instead, it creates a new list `a` which is populated with the integers from the input. Therefore, the state of `cntl` and `c` remains unchanged, and `n` is reduced by 1 due to the input being processed.
