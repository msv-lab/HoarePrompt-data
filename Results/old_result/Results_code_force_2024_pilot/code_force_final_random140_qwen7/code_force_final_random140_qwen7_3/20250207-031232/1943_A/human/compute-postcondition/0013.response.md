Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index appearing in the list `a`.
- After all iterations of the loop, every element in `cntl` will have been incremented by the number of times its index appears in the list `a`.
- The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
