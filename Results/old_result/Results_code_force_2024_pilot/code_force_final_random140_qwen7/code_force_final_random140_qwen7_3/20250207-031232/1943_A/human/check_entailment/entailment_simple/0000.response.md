Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program uses a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each index from `0` to `n` in the array `a`. This is done correctly using a loop that iterates over the elements of `a`.

3. **Determining MEX**:
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is zero. If it is, it prints `0`, which is correct since the MEX of an array containing only zeros is `0`.
   - If `cntl[0]` is not zero, the program attempts to find the smallest index `j` (starting from `1`) where the count `cntl[j]` is less than `2`. It sets `c` to `2` initially and then decrements `c` for each index `j` where `cntl[j]` is less than `2` but not zero.
   - If `c` becomes `0`, it means there is an index `j` where the count is less than `2`, and the program prints `j`.
   - If no such `j` is found, it prints `n`.

However, there is a flaw in the logic:
- The program should consider the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
- The current logic does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob. Alice can strategically choose elements to ensure the MEX is maximized, and Bob can choose elements to minimize it.

To fix this, we need to simulate the optimal moves:
- Alice should always pick the smallest available index that hasn't been picked yet to maximize the MEX.
- Bob should pick the smallest available index that hasn't been picked yet to minimize the MEX.

Given the current logic, it does not correctly simulate these optimal moves.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players and thus does not produce the correct MEX value for all test cases.
