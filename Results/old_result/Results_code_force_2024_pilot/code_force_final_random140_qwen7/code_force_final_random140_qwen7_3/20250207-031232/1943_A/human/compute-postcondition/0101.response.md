Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2, but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
   - `cntl[2]` is updated to `cntl[2] - 1`, but this does not affect the print statement.
   - `c` is decreased by 1, but its initial value and the exact value after decrement are not relevant to the print statement.

2. The print statement is `print(j)`.
   - Since `j` is explicitly given as 2, the print statement will output the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
