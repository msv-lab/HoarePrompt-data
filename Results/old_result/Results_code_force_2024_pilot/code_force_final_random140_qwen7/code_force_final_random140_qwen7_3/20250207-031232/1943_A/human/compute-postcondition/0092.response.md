Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is now `cntl[j] - 1`. If the condition `not c` is true, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `not c` is false.
