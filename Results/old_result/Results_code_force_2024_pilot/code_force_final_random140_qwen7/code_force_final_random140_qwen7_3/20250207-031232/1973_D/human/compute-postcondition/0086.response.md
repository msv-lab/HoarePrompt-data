Output State: **`p` is `func_1(func_1(... func_1((n // k - 1) * max_val + 1, m), m), ..., m)` (applied `k` times), `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is `k + 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `p` will be the result of applying the function `func_1` to the initial value `(n // k - 1) * max_val + 1` a total of `k` times. The variable `i` remains unchanged at `n // k - 1`, `j` is updated to `k + 1`, and `m` remains unchanged at `(n // k - 1) * max_val`. If `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` at any point during these iterations, the loop would break early, but since we are considering the final state after all iterations, we assume it does not break early.
