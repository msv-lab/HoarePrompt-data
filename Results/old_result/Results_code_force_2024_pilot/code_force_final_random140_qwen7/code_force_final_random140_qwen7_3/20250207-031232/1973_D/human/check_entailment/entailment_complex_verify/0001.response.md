### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1(l, x)`
- This function prints a query asking for the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.
- It reads the response from the judge and returns the value of `r`.
- The function correctly formats the query and handles the response.

#### Function `func_2(m)`
- This function prints the final answer `m` and expects the judge to confirm if the answer is correct.
- If the judge confirms, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
- The function correctly formats the answer and handles the confirmation.

#### Function `func_3()`
- This function is the main logic for solving the problem.
- It first reads the input values `n` and `k`.
- It tries to find the maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`. This helps in setting up the initial maximum value for further calculations.
- It then iterates over possible values of `m` (which is `i * max_val`) and checks if it can split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray satisfies `f(l, r) = m`.
- If it finds such an `m`, it calls `func_2(m)` to submit the answer.
- If no such `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)` to indicate that no valid split exists.
- The logic for finding `max_val` is flawed. Specifically, the loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1):` is incorrect because it should start from 1 and go up to `n`. This means the function will not correctly identify the maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`.

#### Function `func_4()`
- This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_3()` for each test case.
- It correctly processes each test case and ensures that the program continues to the next test case after receiving the confirmation.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the queries by printing the appropriate format and flushing the output.
   - It also checks for invalid responses and terminates appropriately.

2. **Finding Initial Maximum Value**:
   - The program attempts to find the initial maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`. However, the loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1):` is incorrect and should be `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.
   - This flaw means the program may not correctly identify the initial maximum value, leading to incorrect results in subsequent steps.

3. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The program correctly iterates over possible values of `m` and checks if it can split the array into `k` subarrays with the required properties.
   - However, since the initial `max_val` is not correctly identified, the subsequent checks may fail.

4. **Submitting the Answer**:
   - The program correctly submits the answer using `func_2` and handles both valid and invalid splits appropriately.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program has a critical flaw in the logic for finding the initial maximum value `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`. This flaw means the program may not correctly identify the initial conditions, leading to incorrect results in subsequent steps.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
