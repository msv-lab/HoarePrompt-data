Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, i * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `max_val` is `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `r` is greater than `n`, no additional changes occur.**
