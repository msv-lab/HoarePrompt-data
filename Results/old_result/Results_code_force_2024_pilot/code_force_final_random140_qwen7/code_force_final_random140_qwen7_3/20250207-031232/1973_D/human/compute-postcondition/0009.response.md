Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4. It does not return any value explicitly but processes the given test cases based on the provided constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (specified by `t`), and for each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as inputs, ensuring `k` is within the range of 1 to `n` and both are less than or equal to 10^4. The function processes these inputs but does not return any value, indicating its purpose might be for computation or validation rather than returning a result.
