Output State: **`i` is -1, `m` is 0, `p` is the result of applying `func_1` 0 times starting from 1 with the updated `m` value, `max_val` is `n // k`.**

Explanation:
- The function `func_2(-1)` is called, which sets `i` to `-1`.
- Since `i` is now `-1`, the loop conditions (`i > 0`) are no longer satisfied, and the loop terminates.
- As a result, `m` is set to `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, which is `0` because `i` is now `-1`.
- The variable `p` remains unchanged from its previous state, which was the result of applying `func_1` `k * (n // k - 1)` times starting from `1` with the updated `m` value. Since `i` is now `-1`, `p` is effectively the result of applying `func_1` 0 times, which is `1`.
- The value of `max_val` remains `n // k` as it was not affected by the call to `func_2(-1)`.
