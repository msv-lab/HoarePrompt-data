Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The only variable here is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: From the given state, `j` is initially greater than `k + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `k + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range `1` to `k + 1`. Since `j` is currently greater than `k + 1`, it needs to be adjusted to fall within this range.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is within the range `1` to `k + 1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, and `j` is between 1 and k + 1 inclusive**
