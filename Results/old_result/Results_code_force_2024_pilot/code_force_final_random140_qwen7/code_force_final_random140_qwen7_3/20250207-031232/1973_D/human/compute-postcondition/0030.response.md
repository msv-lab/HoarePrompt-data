Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` again, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` to be the result of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`. This is the same as the initial state for `p`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the condition for `k` remains unchanged, meaning `k` must still be greater than or equal to `j + 1`.
