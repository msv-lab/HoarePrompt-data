Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Therefore, `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - `k` remains unchanged since it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Ensure the Loop Executes Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Given the above points, let's formulate the new state:

- `p` remains the same as it is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and does not change within the loop.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `k` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`**.
