Output State: **`p` is `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m) + (k - 2)`, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + (k - 2)`, and `func_2(m)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(m)` is called with `m` as its argument. However, since no return value from `func_2(m)` is captured or used, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `p` equals `n` is still valid, but since `p` is defined in terms of other variables, it remains unchanged unless those variables change, which they do not in this case.
