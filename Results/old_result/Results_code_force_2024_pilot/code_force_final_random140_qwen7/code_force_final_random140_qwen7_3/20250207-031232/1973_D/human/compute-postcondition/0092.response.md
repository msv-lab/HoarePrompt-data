Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `0` because the loop decrements `i` from `n // k` to `1`. The variable `m` will be `(n // k - (n // k // k)) * max_val` since `i` starts from `n // k` and decreases by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variable `p` will be the result of applying `func_1` `k` times starting from `1` with `m` as the second argument, repeated for each `i` from `n // k` down to `1`. Additionally, `p` will not equal `n` unless the loop breaks prematurely due to `p >= n` inside the inner loop. If `p` equals `n` at any point, `func_2(m)` will be called and the function will return, otherwise, `p` will remain unequal to `n` after all iterations.
