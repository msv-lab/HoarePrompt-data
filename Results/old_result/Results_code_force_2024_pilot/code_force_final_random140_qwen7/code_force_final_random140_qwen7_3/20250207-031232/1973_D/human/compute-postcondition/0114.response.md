Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from input, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4`. It then iterates through values from `n` down to `1`, computing `r` using `func_1(1, i * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, it updates `max_val` to the current value of `i` and breaks out of the loop. Next, it iterates through values from `n // k` down to `1`, computing `p` using a nested loop and `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` equals `n`, it calls `func_2(m)` and returns. If no such `i` and `m` are found, it calls `func_2(-1)` and returns. The function does not return any value.**
