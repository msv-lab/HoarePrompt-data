Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `m` remains unchanged, and the current value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `p` is determined by the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `m` remains unchanged, and `p` is still greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
