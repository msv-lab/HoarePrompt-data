Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `n` remains as the initial input integer, `i` is now `1` (since the loop decrements `i` from `n` to `1`), `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)` (if `i` was `1`), and `max_val` is set to the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration of the loop. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains `0`.**

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will be `1`, `r` will be the result of `func_1(1, n-1)`, and `max_val` will hold the highest value of `i` that satisfied the condition `r <= n` during the loop's execution. If no such `i` was found, `max_val` will still be `0`.
