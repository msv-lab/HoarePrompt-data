You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
def func_3():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        r = func_1(1, i * n)
        
        if r <= n:
            assert r == n
            max_val = i
            break
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `n` remains as the initial input integer, `i` is now `1` (since the loop decrements `i` from `n` to `1`), `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)` (if `i` was `1`), and `max_val` is set to the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration of the loop. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains `0`.
    for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
        m = i * max_val
        
        p = 0
        
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            p = func_1(p + 1, m)
            if p >= n:
                break
        
        if p == n:
            func_2(m)
            return
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `0` because the loop starts from `n // k` and decrements `i` by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `1`, and then continues decrementing until it becomes `0`. The variable `m` will be `(n // k - 1) * max_val` because `m` is updated in each iteration of the outer loop, and since `i` starts from `n // k` and decreases to `1`, `m` will be updated `n // k - 1` times. The variable `p` will be the result of applying `func_1` exactly `k * (n // k - 1)` times starting from `1` with the updated `m` value, and `p` will not equal `n` unless the loop prematurely returns due to `p >= n` condition being met, but based on the given information, we assume it does not reach `n`. The variable `max_val` will be the largest value of `i` such that `r` (the result of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)`) is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration, which would be `n // k` since the loop starts from `n // k` and decrements until `0`.
    func_2(-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value since there are no return statements in the given code snippet.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

Case_3: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
