Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` again, `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `p` to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. This means that `p` now holds the result of the function call with the updated argument. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the condition for `k` remains unchanged, being greater than or equal to `j + 1`.
