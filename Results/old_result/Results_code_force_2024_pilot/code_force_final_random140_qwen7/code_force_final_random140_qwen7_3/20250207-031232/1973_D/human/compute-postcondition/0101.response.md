Postcondition: `p` is `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 2`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.
