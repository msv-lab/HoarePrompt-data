Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `max_val` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no further operations are specified, the values of `n`, `i`, and `max_val` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
