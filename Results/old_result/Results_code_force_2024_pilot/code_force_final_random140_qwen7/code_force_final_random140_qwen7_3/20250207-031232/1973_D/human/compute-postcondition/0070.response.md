Output State: **`p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is `k + 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`**

Explanation: The code `p = 0` sets the variable `p` to 0. The other variables (`i`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `n // k - 1`, `j` is still `k + 1`, and `m` is still `(n // k - 1) * max_val`.
