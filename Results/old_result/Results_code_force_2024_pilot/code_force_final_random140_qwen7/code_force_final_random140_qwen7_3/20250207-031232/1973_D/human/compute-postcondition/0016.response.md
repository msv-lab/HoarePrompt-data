Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`, `max_val` is `i`**.

Explanation: The line `max_val = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `n - 2`) to the variable `max_val`. No other changes are made to the variables, so the initial values of `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.
