Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `p`, `j`, and `k`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `p`, `j`, and `k` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
