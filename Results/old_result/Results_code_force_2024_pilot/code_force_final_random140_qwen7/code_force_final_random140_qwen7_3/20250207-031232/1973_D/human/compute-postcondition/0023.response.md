Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `j` is initialized to 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be within the range `[1, k + 1)`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments, we need to ensure that `j` is at least 1 and `k` is a positive integer.
   - The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `k`.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `n` is the initial input integer, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)`, `max_val` is the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration of the loop, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `m` is `i * max_val` which simplifies to `1 * max_val` or just `max_val`; `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` must be a positive integer.**
