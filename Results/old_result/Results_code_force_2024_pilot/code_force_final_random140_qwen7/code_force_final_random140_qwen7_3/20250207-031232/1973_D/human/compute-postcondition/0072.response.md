Output State: **`p` is `func_1(1 + (n // k - 1) * max_val, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is 1, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, `k` is an integer**

Explanation: The variable `p` is updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Given the initial state, `p` was `0`, so now `p` is `func_1(0 + 1, m)`, which simplifies to `func_1(1, m)`. The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
