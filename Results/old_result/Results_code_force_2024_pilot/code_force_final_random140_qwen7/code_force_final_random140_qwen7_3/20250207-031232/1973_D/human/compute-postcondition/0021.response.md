Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the initial input integer, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1)*n)`, `max_val` is the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration of the loop, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `m` is `i * max_val` which simplifies to `1 * max_val` or just `max_val`.**

This means that the value of `m` is now equal to the value of `max_val`, which was previously defined as the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n` during any iteration of the loop, or `0` if no such `i` exists. The values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `max_val` remain unchanged from their initial states.
