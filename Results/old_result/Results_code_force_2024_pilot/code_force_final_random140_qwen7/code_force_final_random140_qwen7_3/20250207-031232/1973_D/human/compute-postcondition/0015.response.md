Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be the return value of `func_1(1, i * n)`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i * n` becomes `(n - 2) * n`. The function `func_1` is called with arguments `1` and `(n - 2) * n`, and its return value is assigned to `r`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
