Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - The program defines four functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`). These functions handle the querying process and the final answer submission.
   - `func_4` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_3` for each test case. This ensures that the program processes all test cases correctly.
   - `func_3` calculates the maximum value `max_val` by querying the function `func_1` with different values of `i` and checking if the returned `r` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Query Process in `func_3`**:
   - The loop in `func_3` starts from `n` and decrements `i` until it finds the largest `i` such that `f(1, i * n) <= n`. This step correctly identifies the maximum value that can be achieved by the function `f(l, r)`.
   - The subsequent loop in `func_3` attempts to find a value `m` such that `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1} + 1, n) = m` by incrementally increasing `m` and checking if it can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray's product of length and maximum equals `m`.
   - If such an `m` is found, the program submits the answer using `func_2(m)`. If no such `m` is found, it submits `-1` using `func_2(-1)`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. It ensures that the queries are within the specified limits and checks for invalid responses.
   - The program flushes the output after each query to ensure timely responses.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem statement. It correctly identifies the maximum possible value `m` that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays and submits the appropriate answer.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
