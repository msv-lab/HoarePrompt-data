Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly prints the query in the required format and flushes the output. It also correctly handles the input and returns the expected value.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function prints the answer in the required format and flushes the output. It also reads the response from the user and returns it, which is used to check the correctness of the answer.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is designed to find the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays with the specified property. The logic seems sound:
   - It first finds the maximum value \( i \) such that \( f(1, i \cdot n) \leq n \).
   - Then, it tries to find the largest \( m \) by iterating from \( n // k \) down to 1 and checking if the subarrays can be formed with the product of their length and maximum equal to \( m \).
   - If a valid \( m \) is found, it returns the answer.
   - If no valid \( m \) is found, it returns -1.
4. **Function `func_4`**: This function correctly processes multiple test cases, calling `func_3` for each test case and ensuring that the number of test cases \( t \) remains valid.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Each function performs its intended operation, and the overall structure of the program is consistent with the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
