Output State: **`p` is `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m) + 1`, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 2`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` by calling `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. Since `p` was initially defined as `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m)`, after executing `p = func_1(p + 1, m)`, `p` becomes `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m) + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `k`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
