Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `m` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is assigned the result of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the given code snippet. The exact value of `p` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is now updated to whatever `func_1(p + 1, m)` returns.
