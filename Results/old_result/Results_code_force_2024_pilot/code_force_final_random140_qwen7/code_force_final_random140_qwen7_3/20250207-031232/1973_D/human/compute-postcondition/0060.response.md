Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `m` remains unchanged, `j` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of `p`, `m`, or `j`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional context implied by the initial state.
