Output State: **`p` is the result of applying `func_1` three times starting from `p + 1` with `m` remaining unchanged, `i` is decremented by 1 after each iteration of the outer loop, `j` is `k + 1`, and `m` remains `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, and `func_2(m)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_2(m)` calls the function `func_2` with the argument `m`. However, since no further operations are performed on the variables `p`, `i`, `j`, `k`, or `m` within the given code snippet, their states remain as described in the initial state. The function call itself does not alter the values of these variables but indicates that `func_2(m)` has been executed.
