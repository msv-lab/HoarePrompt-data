Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` is called with arguments `p + 1` and `m`, and the return value of this function call is assigned to `p`. The initial values of `p` and `m` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `p` without knowing what `func_1` does. However, we know that `p` now holds the result of the function call.
