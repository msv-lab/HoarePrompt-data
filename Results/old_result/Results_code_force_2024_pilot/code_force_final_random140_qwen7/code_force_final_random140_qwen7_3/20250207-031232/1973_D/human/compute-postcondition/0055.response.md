Output State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `m` remains unchanged, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `p`, `m`, or `j`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of `p`, `m`, and `j` remain as they were in the initial state.
