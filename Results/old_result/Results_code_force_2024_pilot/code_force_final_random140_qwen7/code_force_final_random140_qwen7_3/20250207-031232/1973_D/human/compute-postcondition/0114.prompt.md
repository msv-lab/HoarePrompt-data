You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
def func_3():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        r = func_1(1, i * n)
        
        if r <= n:
            assert r == n
            max_val = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `r` is equal to `func_1(1, i * n)` for each value of `i` from `n` to `1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `max_val` is the highest value of `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
    #
    #This output state describes that after all iterations of the loop, `r` is computed for each `i` from `n` down to `1`, and `max_val` is updated to the highest `i` where `r` is less than or equal to `n`. If no such `i` is found, `max_val` stays at its initial value of 0.
    for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
        m = i * max_val
        
        p = 0
        
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if p >= n:
                p = 0
                break
            p = func_1(p + 1, m)
        
        if p == n:
            func_2(m)
            return
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `p` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be `0`, `m` will be `0`, `k` will be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` will have executed a total of `k * (n // k - 1)` times.
    func_2(-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value.

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.

Case_3: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
