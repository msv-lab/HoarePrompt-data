Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `k`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is 2.

3. **Loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[1, k + 1)`.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - Therefore, `j` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.

5. **Postcondition**: The postcondition remains the same unless the loop breaks due to the condition `if p >= n`. However, since the loop is still executing, the postcondition does not change.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `m` remains unchanged, `j` is 3**
