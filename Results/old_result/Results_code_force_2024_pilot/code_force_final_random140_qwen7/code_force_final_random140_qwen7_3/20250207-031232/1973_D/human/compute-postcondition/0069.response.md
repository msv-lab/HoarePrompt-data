Output State: **`p` is the result of applying `func_1` three times starting from `p + 1` with `m` remaining unchanged, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `j` is `k + 1`, `m` remains `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, and `m` is updated to `i * max_val`**.

Explanation: The code updates `m` to `i * max_val`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n // k - 1`, so `m` is now updated to `(n // k - 1) * max_val`. All other variables (`p`, `i`, `j`, and `m`) remain as per their initial conditions.
