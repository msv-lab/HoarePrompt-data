Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `max_val` is `i`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, i * n)`**

Explanation: The line `max_val = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) to the variable `max_val`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the value of `r` remains the return value of `func_1(1, i * n)`.
