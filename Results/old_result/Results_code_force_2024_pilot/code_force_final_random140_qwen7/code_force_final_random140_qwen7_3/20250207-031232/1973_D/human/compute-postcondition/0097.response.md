Output State: **`p` is `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Initially, `p` was defined as `func_1(1 + m)`. After executing the line `p = func_1(p + 1, m)`, `p` now becomes `func_1(func_1(1 + m) + 1, m)`. The values of `i`, `m`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
