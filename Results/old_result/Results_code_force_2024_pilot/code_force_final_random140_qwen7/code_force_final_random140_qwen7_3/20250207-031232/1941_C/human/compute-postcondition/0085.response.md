Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `ans` is set to 1, `i` is set to 4, and `s` is a substring 'a[1:4]'.
2. The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`.
3. The substring `s = 'a[1:4]'` means it starts from index 1 (inclusive) and ends at index 4 (exclusive) of the string 'a'. Therefore, `s` will be the characters from index 1 to 3, which are 'a', '[', and '1'.

Output: **a[1]**
