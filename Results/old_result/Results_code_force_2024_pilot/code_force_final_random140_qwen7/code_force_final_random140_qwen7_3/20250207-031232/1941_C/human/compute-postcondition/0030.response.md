Output State: `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be at least 3 * `ans` (which is 3 after 3 iterations), `ans` is 3 if all substrings `s` starting from indices 0, 3, 6, and 9 (if they exist) and having length 3 are neither 'map' nor 'pie', otherwise `ans` is the count of such substrings which are either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is the index just beyond the last checked substring (which is 12 if `a` has at least 12 characters), `s` is the last substring of `a` with length 3 that was checked during the loop.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will be the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in every set of three consecutive characters in `a`, and `i` will be the index right after the last character checked.
