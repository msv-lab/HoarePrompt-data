Postcondition: `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be greater than 9, `ans` is 3 if the substring `s` starting from index 7 and having length 3 is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 2, `i` is 10, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3.
