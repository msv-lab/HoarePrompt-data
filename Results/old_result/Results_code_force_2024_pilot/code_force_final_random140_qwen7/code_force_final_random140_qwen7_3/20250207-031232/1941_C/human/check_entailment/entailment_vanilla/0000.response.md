Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `a` and initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of deletions needed.
   - It also initializes an index `i` to 0, which will be used to traverse the string.

2. **Loop Through the String:**
   - The program enters a `while` loop that runs as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`.
     - This loop is designed to check substrings of length 3 (`a[i:i+3]`).
     - The loop increments `i` by 3 if the substring is either "map" or "pie", and increments `ans` by 1.
     - If the substring is neither "map" nor "pie", it simply increments `i` by 1.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `ans`, which should be the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Substring Check:**
   - The program checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" but only moves forward by 3 characters when either is found.
   - However, the problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. The current implementation only removes characters starting from the third position after finding "map" or "pie".

2. **Handling Overlapping Substrings:**
   - The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mapmap", it would only count one deletion instead of two.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the string might contain "pie" or "map" at the end or in the middle without sufficient context to move forward by 3 characters.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a):
            if i + 2 < len(a) and (a[i:i+3] == 'map' or a[i:i+3] == 'pie'):
                ans += 1
                i += 3
            elif a[i] == 'p' and (i + 2 < len(a) and a[i+1:i+3] == 'ie') or (i + 1 < len(a) and a[i+1:i+3] == 'ie'):
                ans += 1
                i += 3
            elif a[i] == 'm' and (i + 2 < len(a) and a[i+1:i+3] == 'ap') or (i + 1 < len(a) and a[i+1:i+3] == 'ap'):
                ans += 1
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the removal of characters to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
