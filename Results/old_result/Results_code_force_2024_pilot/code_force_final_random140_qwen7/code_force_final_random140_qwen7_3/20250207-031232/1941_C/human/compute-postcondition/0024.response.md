Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be greater than 9.
- `ans` is 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' starting from index 7 and having length 3, otherwise `ans` is 1.
- `i` is 7.
- `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3.

The key point here is that `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3. Since `a` is an integer, it cannot contain characters like 'map' or 'pie'. Therefore, `s` will be a substring of the digits of `a` starting from the 8th digit (index 7).

Given that `a` is an integer with more than 9 digits, the substring `s` will be a 3-digit number starting from the 8th digit of `a`.

For example, if `a = 123456789101112`, then `s` would be "789".

Output: **s (where s is a 3-digit substring of a starting from index 7)**
