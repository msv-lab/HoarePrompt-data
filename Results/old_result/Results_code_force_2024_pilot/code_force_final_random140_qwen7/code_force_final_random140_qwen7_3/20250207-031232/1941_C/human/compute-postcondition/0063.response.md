Postcondition: `a` has a length greater than 11. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is increased by 1 and `s` becomes a substring of `a` starting at index `i+3` with a length of 3. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `s` becomes a substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` with a length of 3.
