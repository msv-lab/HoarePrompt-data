Postcondition: `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index 3 with a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 4, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 3 with a length of 3, `a` is updated to the input string, and `len(a)` is greater than 5.
