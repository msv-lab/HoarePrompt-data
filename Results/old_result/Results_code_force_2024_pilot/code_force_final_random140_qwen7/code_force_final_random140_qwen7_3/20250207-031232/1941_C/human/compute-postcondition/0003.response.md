Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0**

The code initializes a new variable `i` and assigns it the value `0`. This does not affect the values of `a` or `ans`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `a` being an input integer within the specified range and `ans` being `0`, while adding that `i` is now `0`.
