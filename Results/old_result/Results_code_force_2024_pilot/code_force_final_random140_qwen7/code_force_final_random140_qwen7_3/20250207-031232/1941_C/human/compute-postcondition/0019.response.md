Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is 1 if s is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 5, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 4 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, `s`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
