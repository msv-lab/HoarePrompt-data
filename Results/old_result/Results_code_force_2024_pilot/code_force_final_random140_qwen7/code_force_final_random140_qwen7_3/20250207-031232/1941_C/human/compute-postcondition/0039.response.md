Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 3 with a length of 3.
- `a` is updated to the input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5.

To determine what will be printed, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is an integer, but it is later updated to a string.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 with a length of 3.
   - `a` is updated to a string, and its length must be greater than 5.

2. **Substring Calculation**:
   - Since `a` is updated to a string and its length is greater than 5, let's assume `a` is a string like "123456" (it could be any string of length > 5).
   - The substring `s` starts from index 3 and has a length of 3.
   - Therefore, `s` would be "456".

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(s)`.
   - Given the assumption that `a` is "123456", `s` is "456".

Thus, the output of the print statement will be the substring "456".

Output: **456**
