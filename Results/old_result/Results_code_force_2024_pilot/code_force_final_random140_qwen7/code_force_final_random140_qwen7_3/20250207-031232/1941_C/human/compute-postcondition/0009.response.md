Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and len(a) must be greater than 2; `ans` is 1; `i` is 3; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3. The substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables (`a`, `i`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
