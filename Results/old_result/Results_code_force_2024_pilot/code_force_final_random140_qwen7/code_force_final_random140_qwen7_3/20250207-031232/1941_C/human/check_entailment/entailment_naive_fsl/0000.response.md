Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases where the string contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Specifically, the program increments `ans` only when it finds the exact substrings "pie" or "map" and skips exactly 3 characters each time. However, the problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, which means it should remove the shortest possible sequence of characters that includes either "pie" or "map".

For example, consider the input string "mappppie". The program would incorrectly remove "map" and "pie" by skipping 6 characters, resulting in "ppp". However, the correct solution would be to remove only the middle "ppp" to get "mee", which requires removing only 3 characters.

To fix this, the program needs to check for the presence of "pie" or "map" and remove the shortest sequence that includes these substrings. This can be achieved by iterating through the string and removing characters dynamically based on the found substrings.
