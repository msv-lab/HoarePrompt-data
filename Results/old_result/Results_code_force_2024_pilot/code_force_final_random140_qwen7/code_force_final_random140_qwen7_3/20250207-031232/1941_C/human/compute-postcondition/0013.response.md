Postcondition: `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and len(a) must be greater than 2; `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index `i` and having length 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0; `i` is 3 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.
