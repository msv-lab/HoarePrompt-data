Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and len(a) must be greater than 2; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3. The substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3, making it 3. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
