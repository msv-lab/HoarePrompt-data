Given the initial state:
- `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ans` is 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 4.
- `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3, and it is assigned the value of the substring of `a` starting from index 4 and having length 3.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the steps:

1. `i` is set to 4.
2. `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 4 and having a length of 3. This means `s` will be the characters of `a` from index 4 to index 6 (inclusive).

Since `a` is an integer, we need to convert it to a string to extract the substring. Let's consider an example value for `a` within the given range, say `a = 123456789`.

- Converting `a` to a string: `str(a) = "123456789"`.
- Extracting the substring from index 4 to 6: `s = "567"`.

Therefore, the value of `s` will be "567".

Output: **567**
