Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `s` is the next substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index 3, `a` is updated to the input string**.

Explanation: The code `i = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. Initially, `i` was the index right after the last checked substring plus 3. After assigning `i = 0`, `i` is now 0. The other variables (`ans`, `s`, and `a`) remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
