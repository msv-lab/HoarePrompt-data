Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is 1 if s is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 7, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The initial value of `i` is 4. After executing `i += 3`, the value of `i` is updated to 7. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions and initial state.
