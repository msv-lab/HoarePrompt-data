To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < len(a) - 2`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index `i` and having length 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is 3 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(a) - 2` must be true. This means that `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 3 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1.

Since `i` is currently 3 (assuming the substring `s` is 'map' or 'pie'), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to a value such that `i < len(a) - 2` holds true.

Let's assume the minimum possible value for `i` to satisfy the loop condition is 4 (since `i` is currently 3, incrementing it to 4 would make `i` < `len(a) - 2`).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index `i` and having length 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` must be 4, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3**.
