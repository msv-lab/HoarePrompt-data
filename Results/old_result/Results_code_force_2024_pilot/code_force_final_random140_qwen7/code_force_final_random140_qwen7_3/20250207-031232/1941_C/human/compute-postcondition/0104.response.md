Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. For each test case, the function returns information based on the given `t`, `n`, and `s`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific values for `t`, `n`, and `s`, and for each test case, it processes these values to produce a result, though the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.
