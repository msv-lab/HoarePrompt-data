Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `a` is an input string with a length greater than 8.
   - `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` starting from index 6 with a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1.
   - `i` is 9 if the substring `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 7.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**:
   - If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 9.
   - If `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `i` is 7.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - If `i` is 9, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(a)` must be greater than 11 (since `i < len(a) - 2` implies `len(a) - 2 > 9`).
   - If `i` is 7, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(a)` must be greater than 9 (since `i < len(a) - 2` implies `len(a) - 2 > 7`).

Since `a` is already known to have a length greater than 8, we need to ensure that the length of `a` is sufficient for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the length of `a`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` has a length greater than 11**
