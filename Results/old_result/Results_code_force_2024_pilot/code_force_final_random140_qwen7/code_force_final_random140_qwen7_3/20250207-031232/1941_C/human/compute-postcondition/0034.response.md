Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is equal to the total number of times the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' plus the count from the previous iteration, `i` is the index right after the last checked substring plus 3, `s` is the next substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the new `i`, `a` is updated to the input string**.

Explanation: The code `a = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` from being an integer to a string. All other variables (`ans`, `i`, `s`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values, but the nature of `a` changes from an integer to a string.
