Output State: **`a` has a length greater than 11; `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3.**

Explanation: The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the original list `a`. The substring starts at index `i` and includes the next two elements (since the slice notation `i:i + 3` includes elements up to but not including `i + 3`). The precondition that `a` has a length greater than 11 remains unchanged, and the new variable `s` is created with the specified substring.
