Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ans` is 2 if s is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1, `i` is 7, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise it is 0. After executing `ans += 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `ans` becomes 2; otherwise, it remains 1. The other variables (`a`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
