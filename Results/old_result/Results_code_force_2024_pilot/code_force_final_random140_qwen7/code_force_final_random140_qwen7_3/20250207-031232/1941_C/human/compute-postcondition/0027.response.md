Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and its length must be greater than 9, `ans` is 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' starting from index 7 and having length 3, otherwise `ans` is 1, `i` is 8, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3, `s` is updated to the substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 7 to 8. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
