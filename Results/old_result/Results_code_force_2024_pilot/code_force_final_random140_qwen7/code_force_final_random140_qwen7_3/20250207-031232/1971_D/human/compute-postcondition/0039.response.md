Based on the initial state provided:

- The final value of `i` is `len(a) - 1`. This means that after the loop, the index `i` is set to the last index of the list `a`.
- `cut` is the total number of times `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0' for all valid `i` in the range of the loop. Since `i` is the last index (`len(a) - 1`), there is no `i + 1` index available to check against. Therefore, `cut` will be 0 because there are no subsequent elements to compare with the last element.

When the code snippet `print(cut + 1)` is executed, it will print the value of `cut + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

Output: **1**
