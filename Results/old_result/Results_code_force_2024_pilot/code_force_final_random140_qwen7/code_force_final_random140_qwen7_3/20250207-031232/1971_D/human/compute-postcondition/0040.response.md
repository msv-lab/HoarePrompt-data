Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop variable is an underscore `_`, which is typically used when the variable itself is not needed within the loop body. The loop runs `t` times.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is set to `len(a) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `cut` is the total number of times `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0' for all valid `i` in the range of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations, where `t` is a fixed value determined before the loop starts.
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`, the loop variable `_` will increment from `0` to `t-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `previous_value_of_ + 1`.
   - The values of `i` and `cut` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The loop variable `_` will be `previous_value_of_ + 1`.
   - `i` remains `len(a) - 1`.
   - `cut` remains the same.

Given that the loop runs for `t` iterations, let's denote the previous value of `_` as `k`. Therefore, the next value of `_` will be `k + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `cut` is the total number of times `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0' for all valid `i` in the range of the loop, and `_` is `k + 1`**.
