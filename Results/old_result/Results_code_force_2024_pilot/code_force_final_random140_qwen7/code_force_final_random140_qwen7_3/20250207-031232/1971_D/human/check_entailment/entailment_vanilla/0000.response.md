### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of cuts required to split the binary string into pieces such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's before all '1's).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `a`.
   - It initializes a counter `cut` to zero.
   - It iterates through the string and checks if there is a transition from '1' to '0'. If such a transition is found, it increments the `cut` counter.
   - Finally, it prints `cut + 1`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the loop correctly identifies positions where a '1' is followed by a '0', indicating a necessary cut.
   - However, the solution does not account for the possibility of multiple '1's followed by multiple '0's. In such cases, a single cut might suffice, but the current implementation would count each transition separately.
   - The solution assumes that each transition from '1' to '0' requires a separate cut, which is not always true. For example, in the string "111000", only one cut is needed, but the current logic would count three transitions and thus output 4.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we should count the number of '1's before the first '0' appears. This gives us the number of pieces needed because all '0's will be in one piece and all '1's will be in another piece.
   - Alternatively, we can simply check if the string is already sorted. If it is, no cuts are needed. Otherwise, we need at least one cut.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it overcounts the number of cuts needed. Therefore, the provided program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
