Output State: `i` is `-1`, `cut` is a value between 0 and `len(a) - 1`, and `_` is `k + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will decrement by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. The loop increments `cut` each time it finds a pair of elements where the current element is '1' and the next element is '0'. The exact value of `cut` depends on how many such pairs exist in the list `a`. The variable `_` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
