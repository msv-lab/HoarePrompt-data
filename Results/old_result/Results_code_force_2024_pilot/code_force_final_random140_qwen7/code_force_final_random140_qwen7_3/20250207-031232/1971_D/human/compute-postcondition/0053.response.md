Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `i` is currently `len(a) - 2`.
   - `cut` is either `1` or `2`.
   - `_` is `k + 1`.
   - The last element of `a` is `'1'`.
   - The element immediately following the last element of `a` is `'0'`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a) - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `len(a) - 2`, the next value of `i` will be `len(a) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `len(a) - 1`.
   - The other variables (`cut`, `_`, the last element of `a`, and the element immediately following the last element of `a`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now `len(a) - 1`.
   - `cut` remains either `1` or `2`.
   - `_` remains `k + 1`.
   - The last element of `a` remains `'1'`.
   - The element immediately following the last element of `a` remains `'0'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `cut` is either 1 or 2, `_` is `k + 1`, the last element of `a` is '1', and the element immediately following the last element of `a` is '0'**.
