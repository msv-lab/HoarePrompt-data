Output State: **`cut` is increased by 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, the last element of `a` is '1', and the element right after the last element of `a` is '0'.**

The code `cut += 1` increments the value of `cut` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
