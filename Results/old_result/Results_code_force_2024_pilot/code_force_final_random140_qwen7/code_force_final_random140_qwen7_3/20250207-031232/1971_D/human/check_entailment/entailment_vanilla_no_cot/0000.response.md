Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `for` loop is flawed. The current implementation counts the number of cuts needed where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0'. However, this approach does not always yield the minimum number of pieces required to sort the binary string.

To correctly solve the problem, we should identify the positions where the order of '0's and '1's changes. Specifically, we need to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' because each transition indicates a potential start of a new piece. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        last_char = '0'
        
        for char in a:
            if char == '1' and last_char == '0':
                cut += 1
            last_char = char
        
        # We add 1 because the last piece is also counted
        print(cut + 1)
```

This corrected version ensures that we count the transitions from '0' to '1', which correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to sort the binary string.
