Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and 10^6), and `l` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 and the length of the list is n^2). The function returns 'yes' if the list `l` is symmetric around its center; otherwise, it returns 'no'.**
