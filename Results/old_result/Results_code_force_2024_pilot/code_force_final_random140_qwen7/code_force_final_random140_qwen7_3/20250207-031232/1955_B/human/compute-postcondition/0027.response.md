Output State: The list `l` is symmetric, meaning for every index `k` from `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is equal to the element at index `-1 - k`.

**Explanation:**
After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]: return 'no'` will have been checked for every valid `k` in the range from `0` to `r-1`. Since the loop runs until it finds a pair of indices `k` and `-1 - k` where the elements are not equal, and it returns `'no'` as soon as it finds such a pair, if the loop completes all its iterations without returning, it means that for all valid `k`, the elements at indices `k` and `-1 - k` are equal. Therefore, the list `l` is symmetric.
