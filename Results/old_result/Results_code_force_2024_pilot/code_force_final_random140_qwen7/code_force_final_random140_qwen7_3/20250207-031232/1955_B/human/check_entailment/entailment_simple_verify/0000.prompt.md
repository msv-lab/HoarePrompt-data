You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop condition `for k in range(r)` will have iterated through all indices from `0` to `r-1`. For each iteration, the loop checks if `l[k]` is equal to `l[-1 - k]`. If any pair of elements does not satisfy this condition, the function would have returned 'no' immediately. Since the loop completes without returning, it means that for every `k` in the range `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is indeed equal to the element at index `-1 - k`. Therefore, the final state of the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given array can form a progressive square. Specifically, the program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array equals \((n-1) \times (c + d)\), which is a necessary but not sufficient condition. However, it does not check if the elements are placed correctly according to the rules of a progressive square.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( c = 2 \)
- \( d = 3 \)
- Array: \( [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8] \)

The program sorts the array and checks the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is \(11 - 3 = 8\). Since \((3-1) \times (2 + 3) = 10\), the condition fails, and the program returns "NO". However, this array can actually form a valid progressive square:
\[
\begin{matrix}
3 & 5 & 8 \\
6 & 7 & 9 \\
10 & 11 & 11 \\
\end{matrix}
\]

This counterexample shows that the program incorrectly identifies the array as not forming a progressive square, thus it is incorrect.
