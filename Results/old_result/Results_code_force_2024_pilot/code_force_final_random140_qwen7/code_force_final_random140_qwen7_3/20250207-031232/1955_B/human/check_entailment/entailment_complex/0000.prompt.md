Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and l is a list of integers such that 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of l is n^2.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    if (not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d)) :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns 'no'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2. The difference between the last and first elements of `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d).
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if (n % 2 != 0) :
        if (not l[r] == a // 2) :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns 'NO'
        #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and n is odd; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6; `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2; `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`; `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and n is odd, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each integer satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2, `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
        
    #State: Output State: The list `l` is a list where for every index `k` from `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is equal to the element at index `-1 - k`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop condition `for k in range(r)` will have iterated through all indices from `0` to `r-1`. For each iteration, the loop checks if `l[k]` is equal to `l[-1 - k]`. If any pair of elements does not satisfy this condition, the function would have returned 'no' immediately. Since the loop completes without returning, it means that for every `k` in the range `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is indeed equal to the element at index `-1 - k`. Therefore, the final state of the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and 10^6), and `l` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 and the length of the list is n^2). It first sorts the list `l`. Then, it checks several conditions to determine if the list is symmetric around its center. If any condition fails, it returns 'no'. If all conditions pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
