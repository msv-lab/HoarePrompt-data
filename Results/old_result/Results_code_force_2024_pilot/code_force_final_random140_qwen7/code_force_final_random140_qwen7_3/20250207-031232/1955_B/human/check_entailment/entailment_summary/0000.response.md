Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the given list `l` can form a progressive square with the given `n`, `c`, and `d`. The program incorrectly assumes that the list must be symmetric around its center, which is not a necessary condition for a list to represent the elements of a progressive square. A progressive square has a specific pattern based on the starting value \(a_{1,1}\), and the values should follow a specific sequence defined by the rules of the progressive square construction.

The function `func_1` checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list is equal to \((n-1) \times (c + d)\), which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the list to be part of a progressive square. However, it does not check if the list follows the correct sequence of values as defined by the progressive square rules.

Furthermore, the program incorrectly assumes symmetry around the center of the list, which is not a requirement for a progressive square. The correct approach would involve generating the expected sequence of values for the progressive square and comparing it with the given list.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
