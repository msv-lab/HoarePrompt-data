Output State: The list `l` is a list where for every index `k` from `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is equal to the element at index `-1 - k`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop condition `for k in range(r)` will have iterated through all indices from `0` to `r-1`. For each iteration, the loop checks if `l[k]` is equal to `l[-1 - k]`. If any pair of elements does not satisfy this condition, the function would have returned 'no' immediately. Since the loop completes without returning, it means that for every `k` in the range `0` to `r-1`, the element at index `k` is indeed equal to the element at index `-1 - k`. Therefore, the final state of the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
