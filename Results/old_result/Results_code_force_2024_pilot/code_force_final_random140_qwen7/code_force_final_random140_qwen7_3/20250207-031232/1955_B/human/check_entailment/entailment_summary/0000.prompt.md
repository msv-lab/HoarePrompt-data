Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    NO

# Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    if not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d):
        return 'no'
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if n % 2 != 0:
        if not l[r] == a // 2:
            return 'NO'
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
    return 'yes'





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and 10^6), and `l` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 and the length of the list is n^2). It first sorts the list `l`. Then, it checks several conditions to determine if the list is symmetric around its center. If any condition fails, it returns 'no'. If all conditions pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
