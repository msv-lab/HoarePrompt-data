Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and (n * (n - 1)) / 2, inclusive. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the value of `n`.**
