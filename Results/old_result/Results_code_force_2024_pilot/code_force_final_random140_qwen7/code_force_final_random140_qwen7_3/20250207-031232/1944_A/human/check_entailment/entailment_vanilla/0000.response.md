Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
   - If `k` is large enough (specifically, `k >= n - 1`), Everule can only stay on island 1 because destroying `n-1` bridges would disconnect island 1 from all others.
   - Otherwise, Everule can still visit all `n` islands because even after destroying `k` bridges, there will still be at least one path to each island.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly takes the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, k)` with the values of `n` and `k`.
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If so, it returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1. Otherwise, it returns `n`, meaning Everule can visit all `n` islands.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1(n, k)` is correct according to the problem statement.
   - It handles both cases where `k` is large enough to disconnect all islands except island 1 and where `k` is not large enough to do so.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
