Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by implementing a function `func_1` that determines the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the values of `n` and `k`. Let's analyze the logic of the function:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function returns 1. This is because if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, he can isolate island 1 from all other islands, meaning Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function returns `n`. This suggests that even if Dominater destroys fewer than `n - 1` bridges, Everule can still visit all islands.

2. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem states that initially, there are `n(n-1)/2` bridges, and Everule starts on island 1. The goal is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after destroying at most `k` bridges.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k >= n - 1` by returning 1, ensuring that Everule can only visit island 1.
   - However, for the case where `k < n - 1`, the function returns `n`, which implies that Everule can still visit all `n` islands. This is not always true because even with fewer than `n - 1` bridges destroyed, some islands might still be isolated depending on the specific bridges destroyed.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `4 1`, the function returns 4, but according to the problem statement, Everule can still visit all 4 islands if only one bridge is destroyed, so this should also return 4, indicating the function is correct in this scenario.
   - For the input `5 3`, the function returns 5, but according to the problem statement, Everule can still visit all 5 islands if 3 bridges are destroyed, so this should also return 5, indicating the function is correct in this scenario.
   - For the input `4 4`, the function returns 1, but according to the problem statement, if 4 bridges are destroyed, Everule can only visit island 1, so this is correct.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly handles the edge case and provides the right answer for the scenarios where `k` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
