Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `qs` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - (reachable_count - 1)`, `n` is the first integer input, `reachable_count` is `reachable_count - 1 - 1`**.

This means that the `reachable_count` variable has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
