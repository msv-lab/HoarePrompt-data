Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within specific ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2) and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, where `t` represents the number of test cases. It returns a value based on the relationship between `n`, `k`, and the test case limit `t`.**
