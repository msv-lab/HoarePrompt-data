Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `qs` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (reachable_count - 1)`, `n` is the first integer input, `reachable_count` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `reachable_count -= 1` decreases the value of `reachable_count` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
