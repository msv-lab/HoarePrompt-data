Output State: **`n` is updated to the first integer input, `k` is updated to `k - (reachable_count - 1)`, `qs` is still greater than 0, `reachable_count` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `reachable_count = n` updates `reachable_count` to the value of `n`. Since `n` was previously updated to the first integer input, `reachable_count` now holds that value. The other variables (`k`, `qs`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `reachable_count` is now 0, as it has been set to the value of `n` and the value of `n` is no longer relevant for further decrements.
