Output State: **The program returns 1**

Given the initial conditions, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and \((n * (n - 1)) / 2\) inclusive. Additionally, it is specified that the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. However, the return statement provided simply returns the integer `1`, which is independent of the values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the program will return `1`.
