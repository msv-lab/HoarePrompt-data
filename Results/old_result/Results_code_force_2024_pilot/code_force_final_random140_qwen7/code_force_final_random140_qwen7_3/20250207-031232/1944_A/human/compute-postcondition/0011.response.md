Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `qs` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - (reachable_count - 1)`, `n` is the first integer input, `reachable_count` must be such that `k - (reachable_count - 1)` is at least `reachable_count - 1` and greater than 0**.

The code `k -= reachable_count - 1` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(reachable_count - 1)` from its current value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
