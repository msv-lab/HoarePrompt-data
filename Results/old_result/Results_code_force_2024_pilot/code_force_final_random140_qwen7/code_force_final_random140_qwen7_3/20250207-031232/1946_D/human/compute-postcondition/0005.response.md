Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in cur_arr:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `cur_arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
   - `bit` is a non-negative integer representing the current bit position.
   - `new_arr` is an empty list.
   - `xor` is 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `cur_arr`.
   - The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `cur_arr` during each iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `cur_arr`, the length of `cur_arr` determines how many times the loop will run.
   - The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `cur_arr` during each iteration.
   - The variables `bit`, `new_arr`, and `xor` are not directly involved in the loop head and their initial values do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are those related to the loop head, specifically `i` and `cur_arr`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`**.
