Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`, and `new_arr` is a list containing one additional element which is the current value of `xor`.**

This means that the `new_arr` list now contains one more element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original `xor` value and the current element `i` from `cur_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged with their initial states.
