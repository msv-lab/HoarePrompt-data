Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, and `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the next element `i` from the list `cur_arr`. The variables `cur_arr` and `i` remain unchanged, and `xor` is updated accordingly.
