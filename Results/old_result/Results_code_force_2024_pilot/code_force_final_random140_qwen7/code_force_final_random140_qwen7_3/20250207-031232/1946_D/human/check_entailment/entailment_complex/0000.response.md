Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze if the functions `func_1` and `find_new` correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the maximum number of segments such that the cumulative bitwise XOR of each segment does not exceed a given threshold `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `find_new(arr, 30)`, which means it starts processing the array from the highest bit (30th bit).

3. **Function `find_new`**:
   - It processes the array bit by bit, starting from the most significant bit (30th bit).
   - For each bit, it constructs a new array `new_arr` where the current bit is zeroed out.
   - It uses a variable `xor` to keep track of the cumulative XOR of the current segment.
   - When `xor` becomes zero, it appends the current `xor` value to `new_arr`.
   - It recursively calls itself with the next lower bit until it reaches the least significant bit (0th bit).
   - The base case is when `bit` is -1, in which case it returns the length of the array.

4. **Key Logic**:
   - The function checks if the current bit in `x` is set (`x >> bit & 1`).
   - If the bit is set, it returns the maximum of 1 and the result of the recursive call with the next lower bit.
   - If the bit is not set, it returns the result of the recursive call with the next lower bit, but only if the previous segment's length was valid (i.e., not -1).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the cumulative XOR of the entire array exceeds `x`, the function should return -1.
   - The function correctly handles the construction of segments and ensures that the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed `x`.

Given the analysis, the provided functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They handle the bit-by-bit processing and ensure that the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed the given threshold `x`.

Correctness: **True**
