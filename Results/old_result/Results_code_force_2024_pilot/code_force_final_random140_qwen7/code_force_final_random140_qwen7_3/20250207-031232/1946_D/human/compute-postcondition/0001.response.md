Output State: **The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'**

Given the initial state where `bit` is -1, the code snippet `return len(cur_arr)` simply returns the length of the list `cur_arr`. Since no changes are made to `cur_arr` within the snippet, the length remains as it was in the initial state.
