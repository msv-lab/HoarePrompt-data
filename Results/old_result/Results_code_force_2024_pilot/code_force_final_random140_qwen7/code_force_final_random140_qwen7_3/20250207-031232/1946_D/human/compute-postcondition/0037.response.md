Postcondition: **`cur_arr` will be an empty list, `i` will be undefined since `cur_arr` is empty, `xor` will be the final cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in the original `cur_arr` list, `new_arr` will contain all the intermediate values of `xor` that were appended when `xor` became 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`, and `thing1` will be -1 since the condition `thing1 != -1` was false.**
