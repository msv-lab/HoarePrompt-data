Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cur_arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `cur_arr`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `i` is the current element being processed in the loop.
   - `cur_arr` remains the same list as it is being iterated over.

4. **Postcondition analysis**:
   - After the loop, `cur_arr` remains a list of non-negative integers.
   - `i` is the next element in `cur_arr` (the one that was just processed).
   - `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`.
   - If `xor` is 0 after shifting right by `bit` and bitwise AND with 1, then `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` (which is 0). Otherwise, `cur_arr`, `i`, and `xor` remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `cur_arr`.
   - `cur_arr` remains the same list.
   - `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be the next element in `cur_arr`.
- `cur_arr` remains the same list.
- `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` and the updated `xor` cannot be determined without the loop body, we can only state that `i` will be the next element in `cur_arr`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, and `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`.**
