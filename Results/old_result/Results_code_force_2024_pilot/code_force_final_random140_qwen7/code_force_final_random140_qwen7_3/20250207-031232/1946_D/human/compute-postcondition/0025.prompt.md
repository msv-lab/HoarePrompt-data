Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current state of the array being processed, `bit` is a non-negative integer representing the current bit position being considered, `new_arr` is an empty list, and `xor` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cur_arr:
    xor ^= i
    if not xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
        xor = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, and `xor` is the bitwise XOR of `i` and the original `xor` value. If `xor` is 0 after shifting right by `bit` and bitwise AND with 1, then `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, which is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cur_arr`, `i`, and `xor` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, and `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`. If `xor` is 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`, then `new_arr` is a list containing one additional element which is the current value of `xor`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`, and `new_arr` now contains the value of `xor` if `xor` is 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
