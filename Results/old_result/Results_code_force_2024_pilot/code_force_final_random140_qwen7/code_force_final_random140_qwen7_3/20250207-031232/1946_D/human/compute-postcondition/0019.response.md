Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `cur_arr`.
   - The relevant variables in the loop head are `i` and `cur_arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body updates the variable `xor` based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`.
   - If `xor` becomes 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`, then `new_arr` is updated to include an additional element which is the current value of `xor`.
   - Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
   - `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.
   - `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`.
   - If `xor` is 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`, then `new_arr` is a list containing one additional element which is the current value of `xor`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, it will be the first element of `cur_arr` in the next iteration.
   - `cur_arr` will be the rest of the elements in the list after removing the current `i`.
   - `xor` will be updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the new `i`.
   - `new_arr` will remain unchanged if `xor` is not 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`.

Given this information, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `cur_arr` should be the list without the current `i`.
- `i` should be the next element in `cur_arr`.
- `xor` should be updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the new `i`.
- `new_arr` will remain unchanged if `xor` is not 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` or `xor` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`, and `new_arr` remains unchanged if `xor` is not 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`**.

However, for clarity and precision, we can represent it as:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`, and `new_arr` remains unchanged if `xor` is not 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`**.

So, the final state can be represented as:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`, and `new_arr` remains unchanged if `xor` is not 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`**.
