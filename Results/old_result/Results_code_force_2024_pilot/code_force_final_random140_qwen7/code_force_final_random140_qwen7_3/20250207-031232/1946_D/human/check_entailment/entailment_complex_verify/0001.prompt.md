You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1

    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(thing1, find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1))
        #The program returns the maximum value between 1 (the value of thing1) and the result of find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)

    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_new` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and a non-negative integer `bit`. It processes the list based on the value of `bit` and returns one of four possible values:
- If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`.
- If certain conditions involving `xor` and `bit` are met, it returns the maximum value between 1 and the result of a recursive call to `find_new` with `bit` decremented by 1.
- If another condition is met, it returns a specific value from a constructed list `new_arr` where the bit at position `bit - 1` is set to 1.
- If no conditions are met, it returns -1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array into \( k \) segments where the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed \( x \).
   - The segments must follow specific conditions:
     - The first segment starts at index 1.
     - The last segment ends at index \( n \).
     - Each segment must be contiguous.
     - The end of one segment must be the start of the next segment.
     - The cumulative XOR of all segments combined must be less than or equal to \( x \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `find_new` with `arr` and `30` (the highest bit position for a 32-bit integer).
   - This is a reasonable approach since we need to check up to the 30th bit (as \( x < 2^{30} \)).

3. **Function `find_new`**:
   - This function recursively tries to split the array based on the current bit position.
   - If the current bit is set in \( x \), it checks both possibilities: including the current segment and excluding it.
   - If the current bit is not set in \( x \), it only considers the possibility of including the current segment.
   - The base case (`bit == -1`) returns the length of the current array, which is a good stopping condition.

4. **Key Logic**:
   - The function iterates through the array, maintaining a running XOR value.
   - When the running XOR is zero after processing some elements, it means we can start a new segment.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum number of segments that can be formed without exceeding \( x \).

### Testing and Validation

To validate the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example Test Case:
- Input:
  ```
  3 1
  1 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Explanation:
  - We can form two segments: `[1]` and `[2, 3]`.
  - The XOR of the first segment is `1`.
  - The XOR of the second segment is `2 ^ 3 = 1`.
  - The cumulative XOR is `1 | 1 = 1`, which is within the limit \( x = 1 \).

The function should correctly return `2`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and the logic, the implementation seems to correctly solve the problem by recursively splitting the array and checking the cumulative XOR at each step.

Correctness: **True**
