Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, and `xor` is updated based on the bitwise XOR operation with the original `xor` value and the current `i`. If `xor` is 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`, then `new_arr` is a list containing one additional element which is the current value of `xor`. Otherwise, no change occurs in `new_arr`.
