The function `find_new` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers representing the current state of the array being processed, and `bit`, which is a non-negative integer representing the current bit position being considered. Based on the value of `bit`, the function returns different values as follows:
- Case_1: If the condition matches, the function returns the length of the list `cur_arr`.
- Case_2: If the condition matches, the function returns the maximum value between 1 (the value of thing1) and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`.
- Case_3: If the condition matches, the function returns a value from the list `new_arr` where the bit at position `bit - 1` is set to 1.
- Case_4: If none of the above conditions match, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `find_new` is to accept a list `cur_arr` and a bit position `bit`, and based on the value of `bit`, return the length of the list, the maximum value between 1 and the result of a recursive call, a specific value from `new_arr`, or -1.
