Output State: **`cur_arr` will be an empty list, `i` will be undefined since `cur_arr` is empty, `xor` will be the final cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in the original `cur_arr` list, and `new_arr` will contain all the intermediate values of `xor` that were appended when `xor` became 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`. The value of `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `thing1 = len(new_arr)` calculates the length of the `new_arr` list and assigns it to `thing1`. Since `new_arr` was initially empty (as per the initial state), the length of `new_arr` is 0. Therefore, `thing1` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
