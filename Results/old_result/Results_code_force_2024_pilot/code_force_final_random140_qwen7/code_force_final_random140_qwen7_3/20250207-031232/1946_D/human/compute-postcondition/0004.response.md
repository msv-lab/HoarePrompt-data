Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current state of the array being processed, `bit` is a non-negative integer representing the current bit position being considered, `new_arr` is an empty list, and `xor` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a variable `xor` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `xor` is explicitly set to 0.
