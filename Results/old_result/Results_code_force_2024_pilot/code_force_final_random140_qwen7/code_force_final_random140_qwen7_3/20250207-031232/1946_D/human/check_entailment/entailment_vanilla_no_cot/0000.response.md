Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `find_new` does not properly handle the conditions for selecting segments based on the bitwise operations and the constraints given in the problem statement.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**: The function `find_new` is trying to split the array into segments based on a specific bit position (`bit`). However, this approach does not ensure that the segments meet the required conditions (i.e., the cumulative XOR of each segment must satisfy the condition with `x`).

2. **Recursive Logic**: The recursive logic in `find_new` does not correctly propagate the results of the segments. It tries to split the array and check conditions based on the current bit but does not ensure that the segments are formed correctly according to the problem constraints.

3. **Bitwise Operations**: The function should use bitwise operations to compute the cumulative XOR of segments and check against `x`, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a dynamic programming approach or a sliding window technique to keep track of the cumulative XOR and check the conditions for each segment.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution using a sliding window approach:

```python
def find_max_segments(arr, x):
    n = len(arr)
    max_segments = -1
    xor = 0
    start = 0

    for end in range(n):
        xor ^= arr[end]
        
        # If the cumulative XOR is within the limit, update max_segments
        if xor <= x:
            max_segments = max(max_segments, end - start + 1)
        
        # If the cumulative XOR exceeds the limit, move the start pointer
        while xor > x and start <= end:
            xor ^= arr[start]
            start += 1
            if xor <= x:
                max_segments = max(max_segments, end - start + 1)
    
    # Calculate the maximum k
    k = 0
    for i in range(1, max_segments + 1):
        if (xor := (arr[i-1] ^ arr[i-2]) | xor) <= x:
            k += 1
        else:
            break
    
    return k if k > 0 else -1

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(find_max_segments(arr, x))
```

This solution uses a sliding window to maintain the cumulative XOR and checks the conditions for each segment, ensuring that the segments meet the required criteria.
