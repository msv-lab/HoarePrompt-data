Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is undefined, `xor` is the final cumulative bitwise XOR of all elements in the original `cur_arr` list, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate values of `xor` that were appended when `xor` became 0 after the bitwise operation with `bit`, and `thing1` is -1.**

Explanation: The code assigns `-1` to the variable `thing1`. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `i`, `xor`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
