Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is the bitwise XOR of `i` and the original `xor` value, and `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xor` to `new_arr`. Since `xor` is already defined as the bitwise XOR of `i` and the original `xor` value, appending `xor` to `new_arr` simply adds this value to the list. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `i`, and `xor`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition `(not xor >> bit & 1)` being true is also preserved as it was a part of the initial state and not altered by the code.
