Output State: **`xor` is 0, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, which is 0**.

Explanation: The initial value of `xor` is set to 0. The line `xor = 0` does not change the value of `xor` since it is already 0. The `new_arr` list is initialized with the value of `xor`, which remains 0. Therefore, the output state reflects these updated values.
