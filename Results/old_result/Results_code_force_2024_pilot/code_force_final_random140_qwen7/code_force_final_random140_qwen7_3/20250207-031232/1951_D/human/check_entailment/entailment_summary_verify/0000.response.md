### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program and compare it against the problem description and the provided test cases.

#### Problem Description Analysis
- Alice has \( n \) coins and wants to buy exactly \( k \) jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with each stall containing an unlimited amount of jewels.
- Prices per jewel for each stall must be an integer between 1 and \( 10^{18} \).
- Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she has bought exactly \( k \) jewels.

#### Provided Program Analysis
The program has the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
3. It checks if \( n < k \):
   - If true, it prints "NO".
4. If \( n \geq k \), it further checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \):
   - If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
   - If false, it prints "NO".

#### Function Summary
The function processes test cases and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions described above. It does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

#### Test Case Analysis
1. **Test Case: 7 3**
   - \( n = 7 \), \( k = 3 \)
   - \( n \geq k \)
   - \( k - 1 = 2 \) and \( n - k + 1 = 5 \)
   - \( 2 < 5 \) is true, so the program prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices 5 and 1.
   - Correct output: "YES"

2. **Test Case: 6 4**
   - \( n = 6 \), \( k = 4 \)
   - \( n \geq k \)
   - \( k - 1 = 3 \) and \( n - k + 1 = 3 \)
   - \( 3 \not< 3 \) is false, so the program prints "NO".
   - Correct output: "NO"

3. **Test Case: 255 8**
   - \( n = 255 \), \( k = 8 \)
   - \( n \geq k \)
   - \( k - 1 = 7 \) and \( n - k + 1 = 248 \)
   - \( 7 \not< 248 \) is false, so the program prints "NO".
   - Correct output: "NO"

#### Evaluation
The provided program correctly handles the test cases mentioned in the problem statement. It prints "YES" when it is possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels and "NO" otherwise. The logic is sound and covers the necessary conditions.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
