Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation.
