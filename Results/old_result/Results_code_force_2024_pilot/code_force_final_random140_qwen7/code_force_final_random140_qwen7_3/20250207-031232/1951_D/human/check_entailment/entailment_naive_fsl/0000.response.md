Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider scenarios where the number of coins `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, but the distribution of prices across the stalls needs to be more complex than just setting two different prices.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `255 8`

According to the problem description, Bob needs to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. The program logic does not cover the scenario where multiple stalls with different prices are needed to achieve this. For example, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case because it only checks if `n >= k` and handles only two specific cases (when `n == k` and when `k - 1 < n - k + 1`). However, as shown in the example in the problem description, it is possible to set up 8 stalls with prices `128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1` to ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
