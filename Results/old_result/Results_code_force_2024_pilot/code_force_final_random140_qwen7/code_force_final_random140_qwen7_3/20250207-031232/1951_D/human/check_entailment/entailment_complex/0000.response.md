Reasoning:

The annotated program and the function `func_1()` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling Test Cases**: The program should handle multiple test cases, but the current implementation only calls `func_1()` without processing the number of test cases (`t`). It should loop over the test cases, which is missing from the provided code.

2. **Logic for Determining Prices**: The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is flawed. Specifically:
   - If \( n < k \), the output is correctly identified as "NO".
   - If \( n == k \), the output is also correctly identified as "YES" with 1 stall at price 1.
   - However, if \( n > k \), the logic for setting up stalls and prices is incorrect. The current logic only considers a simple case where the difference between \( n \) and \( k \) is used to set the price for the second stall, which is not sufficient to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels across multiple stalls.

3. **Greedy Buying Behavior**: Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall. The logic needs to account for this behavior, ensuring that the sum of jewels bought across all stalls equals \( k \).

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
