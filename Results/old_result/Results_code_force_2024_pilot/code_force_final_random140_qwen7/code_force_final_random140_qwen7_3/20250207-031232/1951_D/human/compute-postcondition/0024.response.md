Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `n` is less than `k`, then `n` remains unchanged and `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `n` equals `k`, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` does not equal `k`, then the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is checked. If the condition is true, `n` remains unchanged. If the condition is false, then `(k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1)` holds true.
