Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), but `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer, and it is given that \(n > k\).
- The condition \((k - 1 < n - k + 1)\) is satisfied, which simplifies to \(2k - 1 < n + 1\) or \(2k < n + 2\) or \(k < \frac{n + 2}{2}\).

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

This statement will print two values:
1. The value of \(n - k + 1\).
2. The integer `1`.

Given that `n` and `k` are input integers with \(n > k\), the value of \(n - k + 1\) is a positive integer. The integer `1` is explicitly printed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **n - k + 1 1**
