Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` equals `k`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is satisfied, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `(k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1)` holds true.
