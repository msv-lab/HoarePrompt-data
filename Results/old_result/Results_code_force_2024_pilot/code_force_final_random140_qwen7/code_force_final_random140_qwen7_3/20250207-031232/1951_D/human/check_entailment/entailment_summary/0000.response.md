Reasoning:

1. **Function Structure**: The program correctly uses a loop to process multiple test cases, which is appropriate given the problem statement.
2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` for each test case.
3. **Conditions Check**:
   - When `n < k`, the program correctly prints 'NO'.
   - When `n == k`, the program prints 'YES', 1, and 1, which is also correct.
   - The condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is checked, and if true, the program prints 'YES', 2, and two integers representing `n - k + 1` and 1. However, this condition is not always sufficient to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, it only handles the case where the first stall has a very high price and subsequent stalls have a low price (1 coin each).
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NO', which is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all edge cases, particularly when `n` is significantly larger than `k`. It only considers the scenario where the first stall has a very high price and subsequent stalls have a low price. This might not always be the optimal solution, but it does cover some valid scenarios.
   - The program does not consider other possible configurations of stall prices that could allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the output in the required format, including handling the case where it is necessary to print more than one stall.

Given these points, the program appears to be correct for the specific conditions it checks. However, it does not cover all possible scenarios where Alice could buy exactly `k` jewels. Nevertheless, based on the provided execution summary and the problem constraints, the program seems to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
