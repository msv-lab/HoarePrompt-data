Based on the initial state provided:

- `que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`.
- `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor.
- `path` is a list containing the full shortest path from `start` to `end`.
- `curr` is `-1`.

The loop iterates until `curr` becomes `-1`. During each iteration, `curr` is set to the immediate predecessor of its current value in the path, and `curr` is appended to the `path` list. This process continues until `curr` reaches `start`, at which point the loop terminates. At this point, `path` contains the full shortest path from `start` to `end`, and `curr` is set to `-1`.

The `_min_edge` variable is not mentioned in the initial state, so it must be a variable that was defined elsewhere in the code but is not part of the initial state provided. Since no specific value for `_min_edge` is given, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `len(path)` will give us the length of the shortest path from `start` to `end`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the value of `_min_edge` and the length of the path.

Output: **_min_edge, len(path)**
