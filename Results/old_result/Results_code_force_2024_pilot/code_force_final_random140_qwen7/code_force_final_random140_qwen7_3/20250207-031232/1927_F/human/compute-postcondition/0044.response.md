Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given code are `w`, `u`, and `v`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(w, u, v)` in the `edges` collection.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `w` is the next weight in the edges collection.
   - `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection.
   - `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection.
   - `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure.
   - `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure.
   - If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `start` is `u`, `_min_edge` is `w`, and `end` is `v`.
   - Otherwise, the union operation between nodes `u` and `v` has been performed in the DSU structure.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the `edges` collection, `w`, `u`, and `v` will change with each iteration.
   - `parent_u` and `parent_v` may change due to the union operations performed within the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `w` is the next weight in the edges collection.
- `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection.
- `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection.
- `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure.
- `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next tuple `(w, u, v)` from the `edges` collection. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `w`, `u`, and `v`.

State: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure.**
