Output State: **`que` is now a deque without its first element, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que`.**

The code `node = que.popleft()` removes the first element from the deque `que` and assigns it to the variable `node`. Since `que` must not be empty, removing the first element leaves `que` as a deque without its first element. The value of `node` is the element that was removed.
