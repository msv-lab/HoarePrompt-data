The only variable in the loop head is `curr`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `curr`. If `curr` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `curr` is the immediate predecessor of `end` in the path.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `curr` must be different from -1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `curr` is not -1.

State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing `end`, and `curr` is not -1**
