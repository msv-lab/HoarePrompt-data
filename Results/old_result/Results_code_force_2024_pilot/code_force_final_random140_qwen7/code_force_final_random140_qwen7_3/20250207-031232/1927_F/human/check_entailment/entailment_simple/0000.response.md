Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `test_cases` times, calling `func_6()` for each test case.
2. `func_6()` constructs the graph and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to detect cycles.
3. The algorithm sorts the edges in descending order of weight and iteratively unions nodes, checking for cycles when nodes are already in the same set.
4. When a cycle is detected, it records the minimum weight edge causing the cycle and the nodes involved.
5. A breadth-first search (BFS) is used to reconstruct the path from the starting node to the ending node in the cycle.
6. The program prints the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes in the cycle, followed by the nodes in the cycle in traversal order.

Given the detailed annotations and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
