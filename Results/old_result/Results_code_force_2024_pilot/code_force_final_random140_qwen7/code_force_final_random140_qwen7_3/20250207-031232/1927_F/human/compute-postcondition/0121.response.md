Output State: **`que` contains all its original nodes except for the first one, which is now stored in `node`.**

Explanation: The code `node = que.popleft()` removes the leftmost (first) node from the queue `que` and assigns it to the variable `node`. After this operation, `que` will contain all its original nodes except for the one that was removed.
