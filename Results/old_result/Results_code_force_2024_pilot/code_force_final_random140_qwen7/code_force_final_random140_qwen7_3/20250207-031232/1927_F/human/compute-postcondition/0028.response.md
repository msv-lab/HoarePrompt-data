Output State: **_min_edge is w, parent_u is the root of node u found using the dsu find method, and parent_v is the root of node v found using the dsu find method.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `w` to `_min_edge`. The values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment operation. The initial conditions that `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v` and both are roots found using the dsu find method are preserved.
