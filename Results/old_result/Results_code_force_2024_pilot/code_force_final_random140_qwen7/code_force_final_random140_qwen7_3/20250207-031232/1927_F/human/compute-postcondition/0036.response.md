Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `w`, `u`, and `v`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each edge `(w, u, v)` in the `edges` collection.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - `w`: This is the weight of the edge.
   - `u`: This is one endpoint of the edge.
   - `v`: This is the other endpoint of the edge.

4. **Analyze the postconditions**:
   - `parent_v` is updated based on the relationship between `parent_u` and `parent_v`.
   - `_min_edge` is updated if `parent_u` equals `parent_v`.
   - `start` is updated if `parent_u` equals `parent_v`.
   - `end` is updated if `parent_u` equals `parent_v`.
   - `parent_u` is set to `parent_v` if `parent_u` equals `parent_v`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each edge, the values of `w`, `u`, and `v` will change for each iteration.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can continue with the next edge in the `edges` collection.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `w`, `u`, and `v` to represent the next edge in the `edges` collection.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection**.
