Postcondition: `node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, and if `node` is `start` and `nei` is `end`, we continue the loop. If the condition `node == start and nei == end` is not met, the state of `node` and `nei` remains unchanged and we continue the loop.
