Output State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`, and `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei]`.**

Explanation: The code `que.append(nei)` appends the variable `nei` to the list `que`. Initially, `que` contains only the first node (`node`). After appending `nei`, `que` will contain both `node` and `nei`. All other variables remain unchanged.
