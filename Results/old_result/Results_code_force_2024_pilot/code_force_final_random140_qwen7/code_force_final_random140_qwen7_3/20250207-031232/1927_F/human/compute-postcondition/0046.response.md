Output State: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is assigned the value of `dsu.find(v)`**.

In this output state, the value of `parent_v` is updated to the root node of `v` found by the `dsu.find(v)` method. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
