Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing `end`, and `curr` is the immediate predecessor of `end` in the path.**

Explanation: The line `curr = prev[curr]` updates the value of `curr` to be the immediate predecessor of the current `curr` in the `prev` dictionary. This means that `curr` now points to the node that directly precedes the original `curr` in the shortest path from `start` to `end`. All other variables (`que`, `prev`, and `path`) remain unchanged.
