Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing `end`, and `curr` is `end`.**

The code appends the current node (`curr`) to the `path` list. Initially, `curr` is set to `end`, so `path` now contains `end`. All other variables remain unchanged.
