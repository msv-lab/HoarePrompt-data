Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the return value of the function `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `test_cases`. However, we know that `test_cases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The function call itself is noted, indicating that `func_1()` has been executed.
