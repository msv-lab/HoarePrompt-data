The loop condition is `while que:`. This means the loop continues as long as the deque `que` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `que` contains all nodes that can be reached from `start` through a series of steps, with each node's predecessor stored in `prev`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `que` must contain at least one element. Since the loop has executed until no more nodes can be added to `que` without revisiting previously added nodes, `que` is currently empty.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `que` must be non-empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `que` contains at least one node.

State: **`que` must contain at least one node**
