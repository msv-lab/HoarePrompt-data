Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `nei`: This variable will take on the values from the adjacency list of `graph[node]`.
   - `node`: This variable is used in the loop but its value is not directly modified within the loop. It is assumed to be fixed at the start of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `node`**: The initial state of `node` is not explicitly given, but it is part of the deque `que` along with `_min_edge` and `start`. The value of `node` is taken from the front of `que`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are neighbors (`nei`) in the adjacency list of `node`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed**: Since the loop depends on the adjacency list of `node`, the state of `node` and the adjacency list `graph[node]` need to be considered. The state of `que` is also relevant because it determines the value of `node` at the start of each iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the necessary states. Specifically, we need to ensure that `node` is valid and that `graph[node]` has at least one neighbor.

**State Adjustment**:
- `node` should be a valid node in the graph.
- `graph[node]` should have at least one neighbor.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node` where `node` is a valid node in the graph and `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor**.
