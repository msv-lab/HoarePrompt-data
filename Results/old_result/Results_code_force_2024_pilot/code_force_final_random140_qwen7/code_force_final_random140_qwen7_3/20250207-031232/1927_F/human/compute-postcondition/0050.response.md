Output State: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is now equal to `dsu.find(v)`, and the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed in the DSU structure.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v)` operation unites the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. This means that `parent_u` and `parent_v` are now connected, and both nodes belong to the same set. The values of `w`, `u`, `v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain as they were initially, except that `parent_v` is updated to reflect the new parent after the union operation.
