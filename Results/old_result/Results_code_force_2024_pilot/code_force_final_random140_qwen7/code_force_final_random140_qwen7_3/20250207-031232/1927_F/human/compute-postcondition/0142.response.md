Postcondition: `node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`, and `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei]`. If `nei` is already in `prev`, the state of `node` and `nei` remains unchanged.
