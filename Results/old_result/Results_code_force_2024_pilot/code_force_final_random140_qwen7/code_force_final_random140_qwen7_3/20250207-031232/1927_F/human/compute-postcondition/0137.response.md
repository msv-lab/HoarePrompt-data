Output State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `node` and `nei` remain unchanged. We simply continue the loop.
