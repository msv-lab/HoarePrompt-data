Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `graph[v]` now includes `u`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)` and `(w, u, v)`, `u` is the first return value from `func_3()`, `v` is the second return value from `func_3()`, `w` is the third return value from `func_3()`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(w, u, v)` to the list `edges`. Since `u` and `v` are the return values from `func_3()`, their values remain unchanged. The value of `w` is also unchanged. The condition that `m` is greater than 1 and the inclusion of `u` in `graph[v]` are also unaffected. The list `edges` now contains both the original tuple `(w, u, v)` and the newly appended tuple `(w, u, v)`.
