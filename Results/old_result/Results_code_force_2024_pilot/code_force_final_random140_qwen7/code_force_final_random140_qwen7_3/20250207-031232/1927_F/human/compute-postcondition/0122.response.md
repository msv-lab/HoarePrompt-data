Output State: **`que` contains all its original nodes except for the first one, which is now stored in `node', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `que` or `node`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was in. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of a loop or conditional statement without affecting the values of `que` and `node`.
