Output State: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure, `parent_u` is assigned the value of `dsu.find(u)`**.

The code assigns the root node of `u` in the DSU structure to the variable `parent_u`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
