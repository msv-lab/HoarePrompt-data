Output State: The deque `que` will contain all nodes that can be reached from the `start` node in the graph, with each node's predecessor stored in the dictionary `prev`. The loop will have executed until no more nodes can be added to `que` without revisiting previously added nodes. If the `end` node is reachable from the `start` node, `que` will eventually be empty when the `end` node is processed, and `prev` will map the entire path from `start` to `end`. If the `end` node is not reachable, `que` will still be empty, but `prev` will contain the longest possible path from `start` to any other node in the graph.

In simpler terms, `que` will hold a list of nodes representing the longest path from the starting node (`start`) to any other node in the graph, and `prev` will map each node in this path to its immediate predecessor. If the `end` node is part of this path, `que` will be empty once the `end` node is processed.
