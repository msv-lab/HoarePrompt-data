Output State: **`prev[nei]` is set to `node`, `que` now contains `[node, nei, nei]`.**

Explanation: The line `prev[nei] = node` sets the value of `prev[nei]` to `node`. The other variables (`nei`, `prev`, `que`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for continuing the loop based on `node` being `start` and `nei` being `end` does not affect the assignment of `prev[nei]` to `node`.
