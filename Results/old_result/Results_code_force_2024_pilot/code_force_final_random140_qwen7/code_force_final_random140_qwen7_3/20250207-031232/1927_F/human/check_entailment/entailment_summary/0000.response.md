Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.
2. The provided code consists of several functions, with `func_6` being the core function that processes the graph and finds the required cycle.
3. `func_6` correctly:
   - Reads the graph's edges and initializes a DSU structure.
   - Sorts the edges in descending order of their weights.
   - Uses DSU to detect cycles.
   - When a cycle is detected, it identifies the minimum weight edge forming the cycle.
   - Performs a BFS to find the shortest path between the two vertices involved in the cycle.
   - Prints the result in the required format.
4. `func_7` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case.
5. All other functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) are used to read input and do not affect the correctness of the solution.

Given that all functions work together to solve the problem correctly according to the provided specifications and examples, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
