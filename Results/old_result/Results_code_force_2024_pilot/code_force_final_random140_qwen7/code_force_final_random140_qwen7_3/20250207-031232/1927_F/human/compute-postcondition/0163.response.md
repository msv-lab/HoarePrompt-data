The loop condition is `curr != -1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `curr` is not equal to `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `curr` is updated to its immediate predecessor in the path.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `curr` must be different from `-1`. Since `curr` is updated to its immediate predecessor in the path, no adjustment is needed for `curr` itself because it will naturally be set to a valid node (not `-1`) before the loop starts the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing `end` followed by `curr`, and `curr` is updated to its immediate predecessor in the path**
