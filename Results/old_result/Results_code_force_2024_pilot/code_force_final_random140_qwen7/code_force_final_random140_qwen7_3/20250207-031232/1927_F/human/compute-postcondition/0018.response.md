Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `m` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed; `graph[v]` will include all `u` values returned by `func_3()` for each iteration; `edges` will contain tuples `(w, u, v)` for each iteration, where `w` is the weight, `u` is the source vertex, and `v` is the destination vertex; `u` and `v` will be the last two values returned by `func_3()` during the loop's final iteration; `w` will be the weight of the edge corresponding to the last call to `func_3()` during the loop's final iteration.**

This means that `m` will hold the count of iterations, `graph` will represent the adjacency list with all the edges added, `edges` will store all the weights and corresponding vertices added, and `u` and `v` will be the last vertices and weight added respectively.
