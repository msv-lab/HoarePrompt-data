Postcondition: `node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, `prev[nei]` is either assigned the value of `node` or remains unchanged, `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei]`, and if `node` is the `start` and `nei` is the `end`, the condition is met and the loop continues; otherwise, the condition is not met and the loop continues as well.
