Output State: **`prev[nei]` is set to `node`, `que` now contains `[node, nei, nei, nei]`.**

Explanation: The code `que.append(nei)` appends the value of `nei` to the list `que`. Initially, `que` contains `[node, nei, nei]`. After appending `nei`, `que` will contain `[node, nei, nei, nei]`. The value of `prev[nei]` remains unchanged as it was set to `node` before the code execution.
