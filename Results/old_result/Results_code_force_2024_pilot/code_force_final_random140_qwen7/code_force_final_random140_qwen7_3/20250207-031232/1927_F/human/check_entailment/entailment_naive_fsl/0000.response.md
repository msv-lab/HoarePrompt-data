Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. Specifically, the program uses a greedy approach by sorting edges in descending order of weight and checking for cycles using a union-find data structure. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the cycle with the minimal lightest edge weight. 

Consider the following test case:
```
6 6
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 4 1
```
In this case, the program will find a cycle with the minimum edge weight of 1, but it might not be the smallest cycle. For instance, the cycle `1-2-3-1` has a total weight of 3, while the cycle `1-2-3-1` also has a total weight of 3 but includes the edge with weight 1. The program should output the smallest cycle, but it does not ensure this.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated algorithm such as finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) and then finding the cycle with the minimum edge weight in the MST would be required. The current implementation does not handle all potential cases correctly.
