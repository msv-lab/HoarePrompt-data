t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5); the second line contains m lines, each with three integers u, v, and w such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6 representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w; and the input format guarantees that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and the graph is not necessarily connected.
