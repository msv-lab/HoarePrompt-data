Output State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in the graph, and `nei` is not in `prev`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value `node`.**

This means that the dictionary `prev` now has an entry where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. All other conditions remain the same as the initial state.
