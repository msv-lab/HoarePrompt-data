Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over `nei` in `graph[node]`. Therefore, the relevant variables in the loop head are `nei` and `node`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `graph[node]` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, `que` contains the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and `nei`. The variable `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `node` remains the same since it is the starting point of the loop.
   - `nei` will be the next neighbor of `node` in the `graph[node]` list.

5. **Update the conditions**:
   - Since `nei` is the next neighbor, it must be a valid neighbor of `node`.
   - After processing `nei`, `prev[nei]` will be updated to `node`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `que` will still contain the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and the next `nei`.
- `prev[nei]` will be updated to `node`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and the next `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`**.
