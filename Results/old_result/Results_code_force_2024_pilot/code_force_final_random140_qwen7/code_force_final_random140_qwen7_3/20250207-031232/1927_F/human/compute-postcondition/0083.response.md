Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and the next `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.**

Explanation: The code `prev[nei] = node` assigns the value of `node` to `prev[nei]`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, the deque `que` and the relationship between `prev[nei]` and `node` are updated, while the rest of the initial conditions remain valid.
