Output State: **`parent_v` is the root of node `v`, `_min_edge` is infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `parent_u` is the root of node `u`, and `parent_u` is now equal to `parent_v`.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v)` operation unites the sets containing nodes `u` and `v`. Since `parent_u` was not equal to `parent_v` before, after executing this command, `parent_u` becomes equal to `parent_v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
