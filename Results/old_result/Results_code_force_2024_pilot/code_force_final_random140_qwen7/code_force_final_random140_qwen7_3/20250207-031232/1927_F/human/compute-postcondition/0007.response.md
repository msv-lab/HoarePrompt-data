Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations (which is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`), `_` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, and the function `func_6()` has been called for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `test_cases` must still be a positive integer (or zero if it was zero initially), `_` will hold the value of `test_cases - 1`, indicating the last index of the loop, and `func_6()` will have been called exactly `test_cases` times.
