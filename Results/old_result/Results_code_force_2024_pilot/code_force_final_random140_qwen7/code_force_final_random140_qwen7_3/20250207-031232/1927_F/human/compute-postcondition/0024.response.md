Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains three variables: `w`, `u`, and `v`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: The initial state given is `_min_edge` is infinity, `start` is -1, and `end` is -1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `edges` iterable.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, the `edges` iterable must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `edges` is not empty.

5. **Adjust the variables inside the loop**: Since the loop assigns values to `w`, `u`, and `v` from the `edges` iterable, we don't need to adjust their initial values. However, we need to ensure that the loop can start by having an element in `edges`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are related to the `edges` iterable.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`_min_edge` is infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `edges` must be a non-empty iterable**
