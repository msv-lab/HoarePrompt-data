Output State: **`que` is now a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end`; `node` is the value that was at the front of `que` before it was removed.**

Explanation: The code `node = que.popleft()` removes the first element from the deque `que` and assigns it to the variable `node`. Since `que` initially contained `start`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end`, after removing the first element (`start`), `que` will now contain `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end`. The variable `node` will hold the value of the original `start`.
