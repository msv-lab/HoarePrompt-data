You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers n and m representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph, respectively. It then accepts m lines of input, each containing three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The function calls another function `func_6()` for each test case, but does not return any value itself. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `test_cases` remains a positive integer and that `func_6()` has been called exactly `test_cases` times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the edges and their weights using a loop and stores them in a list `edges`.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`).

3. **Sorting Edges**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - The DSU operations include `find` and `union`.

5. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges in reverse order.
   - For each edge `(w, u, v)`, it checks if `u` and `v` belong to the same component using the DSU.
   - If they do, it updates `_min_edge` with the current edge weight `w` and sets `start` and `end` to `u` and `v` respectively.
   - If they don't, it unions `u` and `v`.

6. **Finding the Path**:
   - A BFS is performed starting from `start` to find the path to `end`.
   - The path is stored in a dictionary `prev` to keep track of the previous node in the path.
   - Once the end node is reached, the path is reconstructed by backtracking from `end` to `start`.

7. **Output**:
   - The minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the length of the path `len(path)` are printed.
   - The path is printed in reverse order.

### Verification

1. **Correctness of DSU Operations**:
   - The DSU operations are correctly implemented and used to detect cycles.

2. **Edge Sorting**:
   - Sorting edges in descending order ensures that the first cycle found will have the smallest minimum edge weight.

3. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - The BFS approach to reconstruct the path is correct and ensures that the path is a simple cycle.

4. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over `test_cases` and processing each one separately.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The steps are logically sound and handle the problem requirements appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
