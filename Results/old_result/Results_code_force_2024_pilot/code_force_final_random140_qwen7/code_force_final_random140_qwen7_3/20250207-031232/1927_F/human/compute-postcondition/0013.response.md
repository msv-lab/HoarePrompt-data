Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(m):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - `graph[v]` now includes `u`.
   - `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)` and `(w, u, v)`.
   - `u` is the first return value from `func_3()`.
   - `v` is the second return value from `func_3()`.
   - `w` is the third return value from `func_3()`.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i < m`, and `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `m`. Therefore, if `i` was previously some value (let's call it `i_prev`), then `i` in the next iteration will be `i_prev + 1`.
   - The variable `m` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `m` stays the same.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
- `m` remains the same.

Since the exact previous value of `i` is not specified, we can denote it as `i_prev`. However, we know that `m` is greater than 1 from the initial state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `graph[v]` now includes `u`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)` and `(w, u, v)`, `u` is the first return value from `func_3()`, `v` is the second return value from `func_3()`, `w` is the third return value from `func_3()`**.
