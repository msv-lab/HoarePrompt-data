Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `graph[v]` now includes `u`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)`, `(w, u, v)`, and the new `(w, u, v)` from `func_3()`, `u` is the first return value from `func_3()`, `v` is the second return value from `func_3()`, `w` is the third return value from `func_3()`**

Explanation: The code appends `u` to the list `graph[v]`. Since `graph[u]` previously included `v`, and `edges` contained `(w, u, v)` twice along with a new `(w, u, v)` from `func_3()`, the structure of these variables remains unchanged except for `graph[v]`, which now includes `u`. All other variables retain their previous values.
