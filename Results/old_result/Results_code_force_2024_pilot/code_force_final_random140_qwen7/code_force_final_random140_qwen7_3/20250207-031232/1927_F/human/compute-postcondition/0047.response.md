Output State: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `v` in the DSU structure, `_min_edge` is `w`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `w` to the variable `_min_edge`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
