Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and the next `nei`, and `que` now also contains `nei`.**

Explanation: The code `que.append(nei)` appends the value of `nei` to the deque `que`. The initial elements in `que` are `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and the next `nei`. After executing the code, `que` will contain these initial elements plus the new element `nei`.
