Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing `end` followed by `curr` and then `curr` is updated to its immediate predecessor in the path, `curr` is now the immediate predecessor of `curr` in the path.**

Explanation: The code `path.append(curr)` appends the current node (`curr`) to the `path` list. Since `path` already contains `end` followed by `curr`, after appending `curr`, `path` will contain `end` followed by `curr` twice. However, the problem statement suggests that `curr` is updated to its immediate predecessor in the path, which means `curr` is reassigned to its immediate predecessor. Therefore, the final state of `curr` is its immediate predecessor in the path.
