Output State: **`w` is the next weight in the edges collection, `u` is the next starting node in the edges collection, `v` is the next ending node in the edges collection, `parent_u` is the root node of `u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure.**

The code `parent_u = dsu.find(u)` finds the root node of `u` in the DSU structure and assigns it to `parent_u`. The values of `w`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial state.
