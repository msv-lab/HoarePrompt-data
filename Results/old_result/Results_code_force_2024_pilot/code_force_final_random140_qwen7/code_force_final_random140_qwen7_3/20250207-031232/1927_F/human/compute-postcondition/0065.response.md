Postcondition: `que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `node` where `node` is a valid node in the graph and `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor. If the current value of `node` is equal to `start` and the current value of `nei` (neighbor) is equal to `end`, we continue the loop or process. Otherwise, the deque remains unchanged.
