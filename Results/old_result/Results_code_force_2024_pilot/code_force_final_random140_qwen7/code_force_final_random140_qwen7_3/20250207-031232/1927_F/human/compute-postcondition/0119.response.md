Output State: **`que` is a deque containing all nodes that can be reached from `start` through a series of steps, with each node's predecessor stored in `prev`. The loop has executed until no more nodes can be added to `que` without revisiting previously added nodes.**

In this final state, `que` will contain all reachable nodes from `start` up to the point where no new nodes can be added (i.e., all possible paths have been explored without revisiting nodes). Each node in `que` will have its predecessor stored in the `prev` dictionary, allowing you to trace back the path from any node in `que` to `start`.
