Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nei` remains uninitialized.
   - If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `nei` is set to `node` and `prev[nei]` is set to `node`.
   - `que` now contains `[node, nei]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `nei` in `graph[node]`.
   - The loop variable `nei` is derived from the adjacency list `graph[node]`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `nei` is derived from `graph[node]`, it does not change within the loop itself.
   - The conditions for the loop to continue are based on the elements in `graph[node]`.
   - The only variables that can be adjusted are `nei`, `prev`, and `que`.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `nei` must be an element of `graph[node]` that has not yet been processed.
   - If `nei` is not in `prev`, then it should be set to `node` and `prev[nei]` should be set to `node`.
   - `que` should contain `[node, nei]`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `nei` must be an element of `graph[node]` that is not already in `prev`.
   - `prev[nei]` should be set to `node`.
   - `que` should be updated to include `[node, nei]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values for `nei`, `prev`, and `que`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nei` is an element of `graph[node]` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` now contains `[node, nei]`**.
