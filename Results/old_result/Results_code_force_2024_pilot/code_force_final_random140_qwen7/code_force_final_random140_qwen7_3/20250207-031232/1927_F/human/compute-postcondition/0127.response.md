Output State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in the graph, `node` is equal to `start`, and `nei` is equal to `end`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `node`, `nei`, `start`, or `end`, their values remain the same. The only effect is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration without executing the remaining code in the current iteration.
