Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing `end` followed by `curr`, and `curr` is not -1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `curr` to the list `path`. Initially, `path` contains only the element `end`. After executing `path.append(curr)`, `path` will contain `end` followed by `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
