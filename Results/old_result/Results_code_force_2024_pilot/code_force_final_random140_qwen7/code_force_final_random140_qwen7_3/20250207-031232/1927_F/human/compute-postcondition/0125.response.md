Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `node` and `nei`. The variable `graph` is also used in the loop condition but is not directly modified within the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each neighbor (`nei`) of the current node (`node`) in the graph. The loop will continue as long as there are neighbors in the graph for the current node.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the initial state provided. The initial state is that `que` contains all its original nodes except for the first one, which is now stored in `node`. The postcondition tells us that if `node` equals `end`, we break out of the loop, otherwise, no change occurs in `que`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - **Node**: The variable `node` should be set to the first node in `que` (since `que` contains all original nodes except the first one).
   - **Nei**: The variable `nei` will be initialized to the first neighbor of `node` in the graph.
   - **Graph**: The graph itself does not need to be adjusted since it is used to determine the neighbors of `node`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `node` and `nei`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in the graph**
