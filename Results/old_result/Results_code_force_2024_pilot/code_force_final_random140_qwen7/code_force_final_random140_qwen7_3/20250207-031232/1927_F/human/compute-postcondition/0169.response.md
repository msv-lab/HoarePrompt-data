Based on the initial state provided:

- `que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`.
- `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor.
- `path` is a list containing the full shortest path from `start` to `end`.
- `curr` is `-1`.

The loop iterates as long as `curr` is not equal to `-1`. During each iteration, `curr` is set to the immediate predecessor of its current value in the path, and `curr` is appended to the `path` list. This process continues until `curr` reaches `start`, at which point the loop terminates. At this point, `path` contains the full shortest path from `start` to `end`, and `curr` is set to `-1`.

When the `print(*path[::-1])` statement is executed, it will print the elements of `path` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Since `path` contains the full shortest path from `start` to `end`, and `que` and `prev` remain unchanged, the `path` list will contain the nodes in the order from `end` back to `start`.

Output: **the full shortest path from end to start, with nodes separated by spaces**
