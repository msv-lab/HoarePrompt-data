Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0 and the function `func_6()` has been called.**

The code `func_6()` is called, which does not modify the values of `test_cases` or `_`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain the same. The only change is that the function `func_6()` has been executed.
