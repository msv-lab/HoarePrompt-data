Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `graph[v]` now includes `u`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)`, `u` is the first return value from `func_3()`, `v` is the second return value from `func_3()`, `w` is the third return value from `func_3()`**.

Explanation: The code `graph[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `graph[v]`. Since `u` and `v` are the return values from `func_3()`, they remain unchanged. The value of `m` and the tuple in `edges` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `graph[v]` now including `u`.
