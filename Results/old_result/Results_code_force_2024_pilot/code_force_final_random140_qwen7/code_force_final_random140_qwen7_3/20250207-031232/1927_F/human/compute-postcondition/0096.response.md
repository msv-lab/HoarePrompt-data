Output State: **`node` is the first element of `que`, `nei` is an uninitialized variable, `node` is equal to `start`, and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
