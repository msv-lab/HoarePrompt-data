Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the edges and their weights using a loop and stores them in a list `edges`.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`).

3. **Sorting Edges**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - The DSU operations include `find` and `union`.

5. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges in reverse order.
   - For each edge `(w, u, v)`, it checks if `u` and `v` belong to the same component using the DSU.
   - If they do, it updates `_min_edge` with the current edge weight `w` and sets `start` and `end` to `u` and `v` respectively.
   - If they don't, it unions `u` and `v`.

6. **Finding the Path**:
   - A BFS is performed starting from `start` to find the path to `end`.
   - The path is stored in a dictionary `prev` to keep track of the previous node in the path.
   - Once the end node is reached, the path is reconstructed by backtracking from `end` to `start`.

7. **Output**:
   - The minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the length of the path `len(path)` are printed.
   - The path is printed in reverse order.

### Verification

1. **Correctness of DSU Operations**:
   - The DSU operations are correctly implemented and used to detect cycles.

2. **Edge Sorting**:
   - Sorting edges in descending order ensures that the first cycle found will have the smallest minimum edge weight.

3. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - The BFS approach to reconstruct the path is correct and ensures that the path is a simple cycle.

4. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over `test_cases` and processing each one separately.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The steps are logically sound and handle the problem requirements appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
