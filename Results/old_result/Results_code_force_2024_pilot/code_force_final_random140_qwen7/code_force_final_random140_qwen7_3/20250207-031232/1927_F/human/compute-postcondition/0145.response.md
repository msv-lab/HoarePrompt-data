Output State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, `prev[nei]` is either assigned the value of `node` or remains unchanged, `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei]`, and we continue the loop.**

This means that the `continue` statement does not alter any of the existing values of the variables but instead continues the loop with the current state of the variables as described.
