Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge` and `start`; `node` is the value that was at the front of `que` before it was removed, and the current value of `node` is equal to `end`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, it exits the loop where `node` was being processed. After the `break` statement, the values of `que` and `node` remain unchanged except that `node` is now set to the value of `end`, which was the last value of `node` before it was removed from `que`. The value of `que` is updated to remove the front element, which was `node`.
