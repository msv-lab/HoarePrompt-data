Output State: `que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing the full shortest path from `start` to `end`, and `curr` is `-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `curr` will eventually become `-1` because the loop continues as long as `curr` is not equal to `-1`. During each iteration of the loop, `curr` is set to the immediate predecessor of its current value in the path, and `curr` is appended to the `path` list. This process continues until `curr` reaches `start`, at which point the loop terminates. At this point, `path` contains the full shortest path from `start` to `end`, and `curr` is set to `-1`. The `que` and `prev` variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
