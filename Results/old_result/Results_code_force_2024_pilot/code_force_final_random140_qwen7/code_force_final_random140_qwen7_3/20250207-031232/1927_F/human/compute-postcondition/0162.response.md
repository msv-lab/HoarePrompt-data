Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, `path` is a list containing `end` followed by `curr`, and `curr` is updated to its immediate predecessor in the path.**

Explanation: The code `curr = prev[curr]` updates the value of `curr` to its immediate predecessor in the path, as defined in the `prev` dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged.
