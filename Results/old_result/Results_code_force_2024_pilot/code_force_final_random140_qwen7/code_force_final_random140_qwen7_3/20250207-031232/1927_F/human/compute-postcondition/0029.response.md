Output State: **_min_edge is w, parent_u is the root of node u found using the dsu find method, parent_v is the root of node v found using the dsu find method, start is u**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `u` to the variable `start`. This means that `start` now holds the value of `u`, while `_min_edge`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
