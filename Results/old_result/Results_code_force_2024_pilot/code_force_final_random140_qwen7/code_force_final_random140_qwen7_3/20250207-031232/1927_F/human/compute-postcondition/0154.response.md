Output State: The deque `que` will contain all nodes that can be reached from the starting node `start` to the ending node `end`, forming the shortest path from `start` to `end` if such a path exists. If multiple paths exist, `que` will contain one such path. The dictionary `prev` will store the predecessor of each node in this path, except for the starting node `start`, which will have a value of `-1` in `prev`.

In simpler terms, `que` will hold a list of nodes representing the shortest path from the starting node to the ending node, and `prev` will map each node in this path (except the start node) to its immediate predecessor in the path.
