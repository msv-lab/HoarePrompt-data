The only variable in the loop head is the variable `curr`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `curr`. For the loop to execute the first time, `curr` must not be equal to `-1`.

Right before the loop, `curr` is `end`. The value of `end` is not specified in the given state, but we know that for the loop to execute the first time, `curr` must not be `-1`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `curr` is not equal to `-1`.

State: **`que` is a deque containing the shortest path from `start` to `end`, `prev` is a dictionary mapping each node in this path (except `start`) to its immediate predecessor, and `path` is an empty list, `curr` is `end` and must not be equal to `-1`**
