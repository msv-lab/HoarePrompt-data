Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for nei in graph[node]:`. The key variables here are `node` and `nei`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, and `prev[nei]` is either assigned the value of `node` or remains unchanged. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`, and `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei]`. If `nei` is already in `prev`, the state of `node` and `nei` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - `node` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `nei` will be the next neighbor of `node` in the graph.
   - `prev[nei]` will be either assigned the value of `node` if `nei` is not in `prev`, or remain unchanged if `nei` is already in `prev`.
   - `que` will contain the elements `[node, nei]`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `node` remains the same.
- `nei` will be the next neighbor of `node` in the graph.
- `prev[nei]` will be either assigned the value of `node` or remain unchanged.
- `que` will contain the elements `[node, nei]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `nei` and `prev[nei]` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `nei` will be the next neighbor of `node` and `prev[nei]` will be either assigned the value of `node` or remain unchanged. However, we can represent this in a general form.

**State:**
- `node` is the first node in `que`.
- `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph.
- `prev[nei]` is either assigned the value of `node` or remains unchanged.
- `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei]`.

So, the final state can be represented as:

State: **`node` is the first node in `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor of `node` in the graph, `prev[nei]` is either assigned the value of `node` or remains unchanged, and `que` now contains the elements `[node, nei]`**.
