Output State: **`que` is a deque containing the values of `_min_edge`, `start`, `node`, and `nei`; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.**

Explanation: The code `que.append(nei)` appends the value of `nei` to the deque `que`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `que` now includes `nei` along with its previous contents (`_min_edge`, `start`, and `node`). The assignment `prev[nei] = node` sets the value of `prev[nei]` to `node`, which is already part of the output state.
