Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^3 \)) and an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)). For each test case, it constructs a list \( a \) of length \( n \) such that for every even index \( 2 * i \), the value is \( i + 1 \), and for every odd index \( 2 * i + 1 \), the value is \( n - i \). If \( n \) is odd, the last element of the list is adjusted to \( n // 2 + 1 \). The function outputs the constructed list \( a \) for each test case.**
