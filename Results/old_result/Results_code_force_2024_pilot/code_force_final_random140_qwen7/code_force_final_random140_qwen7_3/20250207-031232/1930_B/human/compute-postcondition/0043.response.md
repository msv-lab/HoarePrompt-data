Output State: **`p` is a list containing the last value of `i` added to it plus the current value of `i`, and `i` is last_i + 2.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is `last_i + 2`, the list `p` now contains the last value of `i` added to it plus the current value of `i`. The value of `i` remains `last_i + 2`.
