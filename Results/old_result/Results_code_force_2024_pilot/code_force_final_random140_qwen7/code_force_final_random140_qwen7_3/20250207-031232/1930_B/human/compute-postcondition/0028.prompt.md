Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is the first integer from the input split into integers, `i` is the next even number less than `a`, `p` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
    p += [i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the largest even number less than `a`, `a` is the first integer from the input split into integers, `p` is a list containing `[i]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, which is the next even number after the largest even number less than `a`; `a` remains the same; `i` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p` is a list containing the next even number after the largest even number less than `a`, followed by the next even number after `i`; `a` remains the same; `i` is the next even number after its current value




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
