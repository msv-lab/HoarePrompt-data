Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = []
    for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` must be at least 7, `i` is the largest even number less than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including the largest even number that does not exceed `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `p` contains all even numbers less than `a`, `a` remains the same, and `i` is `a + 2 * (number of iterations)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `a`; `p` is a list containing all odd numbers from 1 up to `a-1`; `a` must be greater than 3.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `a`, since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, starting from 1 and going up to `a`. The list `p` will contain all odd numbers starting from 1 up to `a-1`, because the loop adds each odd number to `p` during each iteration. Additionally, for the loop to run until the last iteration, `a` must be greater than 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
