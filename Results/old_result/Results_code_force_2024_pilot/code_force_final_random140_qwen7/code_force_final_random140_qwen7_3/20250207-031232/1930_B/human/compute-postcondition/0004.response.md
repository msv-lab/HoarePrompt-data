Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `a` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list containing the integer 2.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `p`. Since `i` is 2, `p` becomes a list containing the integer 2. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
