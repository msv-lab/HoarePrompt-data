### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the given program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the condition \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) will never hold true for any pair \((i, j)\). 

However, upon closer inspection, the original assessment contains a misunderstanding. The program constructs the permutation by alternating between even and odd numbers, which inherently avoids having two consecutive even or odd numbers. This approach significantly reduces the chances of one number dividing another in the specified manner.

To validate this, let's consider the construction process more carefully:

1. **Even Numbers First, Then Odd Numbers:**
   - The program starts by adding even numbers from 2 to \( a \) (inclusive).
   - Then, it adds odd numbers from 1 to \( a \) (inclusive).

2. **Divisibility Check:**
   - If \( p_i \) is even and \( p_{i+1} \) is odd, \( p_i \) cannot divide \( p_{i+1} \) because an even number cannot divide an odd number.
   - Similarly, if \( p_i \) is odd and \( p_{i+1} \) is even, \( p_{i+1} \) cannot divide \( p_i \) because an odd number cannot divide an even number.
   - The only way for divisibility to occur is if both \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \) are either both even or both odd, but this is prevented by the alternating pattern.

Given this reasoning, the program correctly constructs a permutation that satisfies the problem's requirements. The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program was incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the construction logic.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct.
