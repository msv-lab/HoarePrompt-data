Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program generates a permutation by alternating between even and odd numbers. However, this approach does not guarantee that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) (with \(1 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\)) will satisfy the condition that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\). 

For example, consider \(n = 6\):

- The generated permutation would be \([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]\).
- Here, \(p_1 = 2\) divides \(p_3 = 4\) and \(p_2 = 1\) divides \(p_4 = 3\), which violates the condition.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
