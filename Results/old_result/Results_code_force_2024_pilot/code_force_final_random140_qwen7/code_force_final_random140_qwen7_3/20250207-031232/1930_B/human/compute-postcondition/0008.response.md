Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `a` must be at least 7, `i` is 6, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, and 6**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 6) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains the integers 2 and 4. After executing the code, `p` will contain 2, 4, and 6. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
