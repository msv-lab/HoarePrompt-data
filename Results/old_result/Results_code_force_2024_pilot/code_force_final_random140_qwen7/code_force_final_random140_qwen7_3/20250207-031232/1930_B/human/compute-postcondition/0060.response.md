Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The function processes these test cases and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and `n`. For each test case, it checks if the conditions for `t` and `n` are met and then performs some operation based on these values. However, since the function signature does not explicitly include parameters, the focus is on the implied input structure and the expected output based on the provided constraints.
