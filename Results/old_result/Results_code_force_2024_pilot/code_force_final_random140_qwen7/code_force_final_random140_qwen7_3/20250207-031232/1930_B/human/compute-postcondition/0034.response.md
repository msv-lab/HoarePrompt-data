Output State: **`p` is a list containing all even numbers less than `a`, `a` remains the same, `i` is `a + 2`, and `p` now includes the value `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains all even numbers less than `a`, `i` is `a + 2`, and `p` now includes the value `i`. Since `i` is `a + 2`, appending `i` to `p` means `p` now includes `a + 2`. The next even number after `i` (which is `a + 2`) would be `i + 2` (which is `a + 4`). Therefore, `p` now includes `a + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
