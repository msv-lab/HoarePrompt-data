Output State: **`p` is a list containing all even numbers less than `a`, `a` remains the same, `i` is `a + 2`, and `p` now includes the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is defined as `a + 2`, `p` now includes all even numbers less than `a` plus the additional value `i`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged, and `p` now contains one more element, which is `i`.
