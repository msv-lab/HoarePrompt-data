Output State: **`p` is a list containing the last value of `i` added to it plus the current value of `i`, and `i` is last_i + 4, and `p` is updated by adding `[i]` to it.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is `last_i + 4`, the list `p` now includes the last value of `i` added to it plus the current value of `i`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
