Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` is the first integer from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to the variable `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned in the initial state and not used or modified in the given code.
