Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `p` is an empty list, and `i` is `a + 2 * (number of iterations + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `p = []` initializes an empty list `p`. This operation does not affect the values of `a` or `i`. Therefore, `a` remains as the first integer from the input, `p` becomes an empty list, and `i` is still calculated as `a + 2 * (number of iterations + 1)`.
