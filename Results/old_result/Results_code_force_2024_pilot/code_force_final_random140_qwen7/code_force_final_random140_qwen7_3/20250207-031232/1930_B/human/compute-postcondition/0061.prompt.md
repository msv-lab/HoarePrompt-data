You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        for i in range(n // 2):
            a[2 * i + 1] = n - i
            a[2 * i] = i + 1
        
        if len(a) % 2 == 1:
            a[n - 1] = n // 2 + 1
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The variable `i` will be `n // 2` for the last iteration. The list `a` will be constructed such that for every even index `2 * i`, the value will be `i + 1`, and for every odd index `2 * i + 1`, the value will be `n - i`. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element `a[n-1]` will be `n // 2 + 1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, the list `a` will be rearranged according to the specified pattern for each `n` provided, and the final state of `a` will depend on whether `n` is even or odd.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The function processes these test cases and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
