Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, `ans2` now contains all elements from `l` as pairs, and `l` is an empty list.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have been decremented until it reaches -1 (since `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by 1 each iteration). The loop condition `i in range(len(l))` ensures that the loop continues as long as `i` is within the bounds of the list `l`. Since `l` starts with all unique elements and `ans2` collects these elements as pairs, by the end of the loop, `l` will be empty, and `ans1` and `ans2` will both contain all elements from the original list `l`.
