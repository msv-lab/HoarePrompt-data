Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `l` contains the value of `b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `b[i - 1]` is equivalent to `b[0]`. Since `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0]`. After executing the code, `l` will contain the value of `b[0]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
