Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing the element at index 1 of list `l`, `ans2` is a list containing the element at index 2 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) of list `l` to `ans2`. Initially, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`. After appending, `ans2` now contains the elements at indices 1 and 2 of list `l`. The values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, and the content of `ans2` are updated accordingly.
