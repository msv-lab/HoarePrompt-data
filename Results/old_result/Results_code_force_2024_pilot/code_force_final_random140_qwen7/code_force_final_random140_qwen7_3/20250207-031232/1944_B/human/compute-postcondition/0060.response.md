Output State: **`k` is `req`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` up to index `n-1`, and `l` contains all unique elements from `b` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans1`. If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` includes `b[n-1]`.**

Explanation: The line `k = req` simply assigns the value of `req` to `k`. No other changes are made to the other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `l`). Therefore, the values of `i`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged from their previous states.
