Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` contains at least one element.
- `elem` is the first element of `sng`.
- The size of `sng` (denoted as `sz`) is checked against `2 * k`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, the loop or conditional block is exited.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of `sng`.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we will use the variable name to represent it.

Output: **elem**
