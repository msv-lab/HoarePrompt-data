Output State: **`ans1` contains all elements from `l` except the last one, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains all elements from `l` except the last one, `i` is equal to the length of `l`, and `q` is 1, `b` is a list of the first `n` elements from `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` containing the first `n` elements of the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `b` will contain the first `n` elements of `a`. The other variables (`ans1`, `k`, `ans2`, `i`, and `q`) remain unchanged.
