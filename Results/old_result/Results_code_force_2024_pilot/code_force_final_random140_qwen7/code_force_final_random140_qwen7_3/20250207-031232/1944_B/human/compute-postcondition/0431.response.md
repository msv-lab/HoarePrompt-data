Output State: **`sz` is increased by 1, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and the size of `sng` must be less than 2 times `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of `sz`, `sng`, and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
