Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `k` is `-2 * (n - 1)`
- `ans1` is a list containing all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop
- `ans2` is a list containing all elements from `c[1]` onwards where each element is a duplicate of its preceding element
- `q` is 1
- `req` is unchanged
- `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`

The `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans2`.

To determine the exact elements in `ans2`, we need to know the structure of the list `c`. Since `c` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact elements of `ans2`. However, we know that `ans2` contains elements from `c[1]` onwards where each element is a duplicate of its preceding element.

Therefore, the output will be a series of elements from `c[1]` onwards, each being a duplicate of the previous element in the list.

Output: **[element1, element1, element2, element2, ...] (where each element is followed by its duplicate in the list `c` starting from index 1)**
