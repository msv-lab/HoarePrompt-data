Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `k` is either -2 or 0; `ans1` now contains the elements `[b[3], b[3]]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, `b[3]` is appended to `ans1`. Since `ans1` initially contained the element `b[3]`, after appending `b[3]` again, `ans1` now contains `[b[3], b[3]]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
