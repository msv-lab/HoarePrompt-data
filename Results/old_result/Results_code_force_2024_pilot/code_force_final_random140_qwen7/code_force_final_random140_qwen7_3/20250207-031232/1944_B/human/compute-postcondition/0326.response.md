Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, `ans1` will contain the element at index 1 of list `l`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
