Output State: **`sz` is the highest multiple of 2 that satisfies \(2 * k - sz \geq 2\), `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` is empty, and `sng` must contain at least one element.**

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `sz` will be the largest even number such that \(2 * k - sz \geq 2\). The variable `i` remains equal to `n`. The list `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except for the last such element. The variable `n` keeps its original value, which represents the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`. The list `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements. The list `ldb` is empty, and the iterable `sng` must contain at least one element.
