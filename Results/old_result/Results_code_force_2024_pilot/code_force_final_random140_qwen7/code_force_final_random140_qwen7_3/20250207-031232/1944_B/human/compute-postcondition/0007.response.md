Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (the first `n` elements of `a`), `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`).**

Explanation: The code `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` is still a list of the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is now a list of the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, also sorted in ascending order.
