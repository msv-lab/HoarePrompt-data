Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `k` is -2, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains `c[1]` appended; otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged.**
