Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `sng` or `elem`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only effect is the breaking out of the implied loop or conditional.
