Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `sz`, `i`, `rdb`, `n`, `rgt`, and `ldb` remain unchanged, and the condition for continuing the loop (that `ldb` must contain at least one element) also remains the same.
