Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `ans1`, and `ans2`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. All other variables retain their initial states.
