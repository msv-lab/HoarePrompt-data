Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` appended with `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 2 (assuming `i` is incremented elsewhere in the code or it's part of a loop). Since `b[1]` was already in `ans1`, now `ans1` contains `b[1]` followed by `b[2]`. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged.
