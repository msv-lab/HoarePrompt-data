Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (the first `n` elements of `a`), `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `b`, which contains the first `n` elements of list `a`, in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
