Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `sng`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and `sng` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element, and `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `sng` must contain at least one element, it will still contain at least one element for the next iteration.
   - `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

5. **Consider the given information**: `sz` is increased by 1, but this does not affect the loop head variables directly.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `sng` must contain at least one element (same as before).
- `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`sng` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `sng`**.
