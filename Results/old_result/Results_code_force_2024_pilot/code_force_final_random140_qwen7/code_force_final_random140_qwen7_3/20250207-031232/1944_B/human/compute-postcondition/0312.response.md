Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `k` is -6, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and now includes `c[i]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and `c[i]` is appended to `ans2`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, so `k` becomes `-4 - 2 = -6`. The values of `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, `req`, `l`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged.
