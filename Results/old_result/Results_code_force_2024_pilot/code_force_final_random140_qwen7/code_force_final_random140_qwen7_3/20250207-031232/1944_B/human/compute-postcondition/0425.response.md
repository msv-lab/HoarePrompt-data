Output State: **`sng` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `sng', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sng` or `elem`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of an implicit one. The precondition that `sng` must contain at least two elements and that `elem` is the second element of `sng` remains unchanged.
