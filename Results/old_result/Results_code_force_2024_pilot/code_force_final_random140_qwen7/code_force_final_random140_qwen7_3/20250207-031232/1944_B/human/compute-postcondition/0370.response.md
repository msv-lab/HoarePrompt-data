Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng:`. The objects involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `sng` is a collection (list, set, etc.) that contains elements.
   - `elem` is an element from `sng`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng`. The loop body itself does not change the values of `elem` or `sng` directly, but it processes each element in `sng`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop processes each element in `sng`, `sng` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `elem` will change with each iteration, but we don't need to specify its exact value initially because it changes within the loop.

Given the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `sng` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: `sng` must contain at least one element**
