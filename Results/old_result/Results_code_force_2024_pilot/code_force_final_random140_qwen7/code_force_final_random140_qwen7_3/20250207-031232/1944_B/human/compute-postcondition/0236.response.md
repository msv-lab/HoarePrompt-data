Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the length of `l`, and `q` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = []` assigns an empty list to `ans2`. This does not affect the values of `ans1`, `k`, `i`, `q`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
