Reasoning: 
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the first half and second half of the array `a` and then constructing the arrays `l` and `r` based on the sorted halves. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Here are the key issues:

1. **Sorting and Pairs Selection**: The program sorts the first half (`b`) and the second half (`c`) of the array `a`. Then, it tries to form `l` and `r` by selecting pairs of consecutive duplicates from `b` and `c`. This approach does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` will be equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing `l` and `r`**: The program constructs `l` and `r` by appending pairs of consecutive duplicates from `b` and `c`. This method does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` will be equal. Instead, it should aim to balance the XOR values by carefully selecting elements from both halves.

3. **Incomplete Handling of Remaining Elements**: The program does not handle the remaining elements in `l` and `r` correctly. Specifically, it appends elements from `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2`, which might not result in the required XOR equality.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
