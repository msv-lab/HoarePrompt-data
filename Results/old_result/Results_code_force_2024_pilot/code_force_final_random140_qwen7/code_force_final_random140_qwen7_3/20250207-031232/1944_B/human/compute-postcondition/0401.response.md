Postcondition: `rdb` must contain at least one element. If the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is true, then `sz` is increased by 2 and the condition remains true. If the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is false, then `rdb` still contains at least one element, and either the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
