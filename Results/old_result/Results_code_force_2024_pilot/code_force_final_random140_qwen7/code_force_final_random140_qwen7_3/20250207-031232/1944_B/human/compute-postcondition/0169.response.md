Output State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `l` is a list containing elements from the sorted first `n-1` elements of `a` that are not in `ans1` with `b[n - 1]` appended, and `q` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element `b[n - 1]` to the list `l`. Since `b[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `b`, which corresponds to the `n-1`th element of the list `a` (as `a` and `b` are assumed to be the same list), it is added to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
