Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is 0
   - The postcondition mentions that if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended with `c[1]`. However, since there is no else part, the value of `k` remains 0.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since the loop starts from 1 and increments by 1).
   - Therefore, `i` becomes 2.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged at 0 because there is no condition or operation inside the loop that changes `k`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 2
   - `k` remains 0

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0**
