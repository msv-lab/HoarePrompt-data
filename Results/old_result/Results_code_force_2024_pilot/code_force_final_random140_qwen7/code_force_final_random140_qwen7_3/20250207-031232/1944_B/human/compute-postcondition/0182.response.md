Output State: **`ans2` now contains the value of `c[1]` appended with `c[1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 1, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, and `c[i - 1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[1]` appended with `c[1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
