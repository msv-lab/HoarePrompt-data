Output State: **`k` is `req`, `i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `l` is a list containing elements from the sorted first `n-1` elements of `a` that are not in `ans1` with `b[n - 1]` appended, and `q` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `k = req` simply assigns the value of `req` to `k`. All other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `l`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
