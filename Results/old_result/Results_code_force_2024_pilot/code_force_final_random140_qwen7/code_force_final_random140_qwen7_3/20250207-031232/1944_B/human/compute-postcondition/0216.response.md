Output State: **`ans1` contains the elements `[l[0], l[i]]`, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains the element `l[1]`, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code appends `l[i]` to `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans1` now contains the elements `l[0]` and `l[3]`. The value of `k` remains 0, and `ans2` still contains the element `l[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3.
