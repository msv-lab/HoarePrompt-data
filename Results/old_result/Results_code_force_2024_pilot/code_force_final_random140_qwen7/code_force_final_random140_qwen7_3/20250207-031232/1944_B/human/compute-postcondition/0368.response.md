Output State: `sz` is either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must be empty or contain no elements for the loop to exit, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if necessary.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `sz` will be an even number between 0 and 8 inclusive, depending on how many times the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` was satisfied. The variable `i` will still be equal to `n`, `rdb` will still contain the appropriate elements from `rgt`, `n` will retain its original value, `rgt` will remain unchanged, and `ldb` will be exhausted (either empty or with no more elements to process) since the loop breaks when the condition is no longer met.
