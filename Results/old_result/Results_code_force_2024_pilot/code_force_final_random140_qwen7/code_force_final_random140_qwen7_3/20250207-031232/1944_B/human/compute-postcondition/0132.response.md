Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is initially 1, `ans1` now contains the value of `b[1]`. The conditions and values of other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged.
