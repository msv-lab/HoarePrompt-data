Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `n-1`, `k` will be equal to its initial value minus 2 times the number of consecutive duplicates found in the list `b` up to index `n-1`, `ans1` will contain pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` up to index `n-1`, and `l` will contain all unique elements from `b` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans1`. The current value of `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`.**
