Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and `k` is 0; `ans1` now contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` from the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans1` initially contains the element `b[2]`, and after executing the code, `ans1` will contain `b[2]` twice. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
