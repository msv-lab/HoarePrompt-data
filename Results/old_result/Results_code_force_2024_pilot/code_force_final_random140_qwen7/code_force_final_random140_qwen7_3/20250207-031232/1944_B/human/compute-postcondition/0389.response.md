The initial state is as follows:
- `sz` is the highest multiple of 2 that satisfies \(2 * k - (sz + 1) \geq 2\) + 1.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element.
- `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`.
- `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements.
- `ldb` is empty.
- `sng` must contain at least one element.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The code snippet is:
```python
sz += 1
```

This line increments the value of `sz` by 1. Since `sz` was initially the highest multiple of 2 that satisfied the given condition, incrementing it by 1 will make it no longer a multiple of 2 unless it was already even. However, the exact value of `sz` is not specified, so we know it has been incremented by 1.

The other variables remain unchanged because the code only affects `sz`.

Output State: **`sz` is the highest multiple of 2 that satisfies \(2 * k - (sz + 1) \geq 2\) + 1 + 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` is empty, and `sng` must contain at least one element.**
