Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 1, `c[i]` is `c[1]`. Since `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, and `i` is 1, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`. Therefore, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[0]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
