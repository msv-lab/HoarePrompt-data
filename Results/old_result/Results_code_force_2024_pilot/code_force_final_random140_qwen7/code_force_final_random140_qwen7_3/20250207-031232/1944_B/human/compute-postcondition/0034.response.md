Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `k`. Instead, it indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
