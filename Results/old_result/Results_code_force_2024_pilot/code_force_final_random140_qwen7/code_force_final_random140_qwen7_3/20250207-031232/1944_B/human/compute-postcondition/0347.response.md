Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last one, and `n` will still be the input integer representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`.

In more detail:
- The variable `i` will reach the value of `n` after the loop completes all its iterations.
- The list `rdb` will store all elements from `rgt` that are repeated consecutively, excluding the last such element.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and represents the length of the first segment of `rgt` that was used to create `rdb`.
