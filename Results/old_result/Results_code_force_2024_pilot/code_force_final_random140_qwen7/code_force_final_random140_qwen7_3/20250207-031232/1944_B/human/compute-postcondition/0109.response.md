Output: **[]**

Explanation:
- `i` is -1.
- `k` is 0.
- `ans1` contains all elements from `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `ans1` is also an empty list.
- `ans2` now contains all elements from `l` as pairs. Again, since `l` is an empty list, `ans2` is also an empty list, but this detail is not relevant to the `print(*ans1)` statement.

Therefore, when `print(*ans1)` is executed, it will print the elements of `ans1`, which is an empty list, resulting in an empty output.
