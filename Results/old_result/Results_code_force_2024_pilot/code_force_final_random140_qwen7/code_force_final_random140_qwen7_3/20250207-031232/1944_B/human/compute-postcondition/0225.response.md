Output State: `ans1` contains all elements from `l` except the last one, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains all elements from `l` except the last one, and `i` is equal to the length of `l`.

To understand this, let's analyze the loop:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(l)`.
- If `k` equals 0, the loop breaks, but since `k` is never modified within the loop, it will always continue until `i` reaches the length of `l`.
- During each iteration, `ans1` appends `l[i]`, and `ans2` also appends `l[i]`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `ans1` and `ans2` will contain all elements of `l` except for the last one (since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(l) - 1`), and `i` will be equal to the length of `l`.
