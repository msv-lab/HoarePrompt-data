Output State: **All elements in `ans2` are duplicates of consecutive elements from the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, and `k` is 0.**

In the given loop, the variable `k` is initialized to 0 and decremented by 2 each time a consecutive duplicate is found. The loop breaks when `k` reaches 0. After the loop completes, `k` will be 0 because the loop ensures that `k` is only decremented and eventually reaches 0, causing the loop to terminate. All consecutive duplicates found during the loop's execution are appended to `ans2`. Since the loop processes each element up to `n-1`, `ans2` will contain all consecutive duplicates from the sorted first `n` elements of `a`.
