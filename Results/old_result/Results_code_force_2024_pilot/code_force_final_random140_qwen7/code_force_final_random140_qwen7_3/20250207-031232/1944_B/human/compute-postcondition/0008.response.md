Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (the first `n` elements of `a`), `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`), `ans1` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `ans1` as an empty list. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
