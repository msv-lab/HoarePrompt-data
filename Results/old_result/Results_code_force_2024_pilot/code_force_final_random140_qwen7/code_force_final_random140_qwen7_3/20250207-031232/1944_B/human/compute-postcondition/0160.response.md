Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `k` equals 0, and `ans1` contains the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, `b[3]` is appended to `ans1`. Since `ans1` initially contained the element `b[3]`, after appending `b[3]` again, `ans1` now contains `b[3]` twice. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the content of `ans1` are updated accordingly, but the conditions and values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
