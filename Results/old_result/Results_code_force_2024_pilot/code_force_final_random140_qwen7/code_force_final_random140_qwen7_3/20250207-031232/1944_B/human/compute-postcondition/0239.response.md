Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the length of an empty list [], `q` is 1, `req` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `l` which is an empty list. This does not affect the values of `ans1`, `k`, `ans2`, `i`, `q`, or `req`. The value of `i` remains equal to the length of the original `l`, which was also an empty list.
