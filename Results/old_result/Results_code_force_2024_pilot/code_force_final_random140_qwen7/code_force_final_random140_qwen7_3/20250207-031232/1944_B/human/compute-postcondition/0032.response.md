Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, and either `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is equal to `b[i-1]` (which is `b[0]`), in which case `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` appended with `b[2]` and `k` is -2, or `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i-1]`, in which case `l` contains the value of `b[i-1]` (which is `b[0]`) if `b[i-1]` is not already in `ans1`.
