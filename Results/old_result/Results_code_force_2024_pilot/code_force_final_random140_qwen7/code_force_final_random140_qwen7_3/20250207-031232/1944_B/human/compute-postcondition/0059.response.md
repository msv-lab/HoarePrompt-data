Postcondition: **After the execution of the if-else block, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is its initial value minus 2 times the number of consecutive duplicates found in the list `b` up to index `n-1`, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` up to index `n-1`, and `l` contains all unique elements from `b` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans1`. If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` includes `b[n-1]`.**
