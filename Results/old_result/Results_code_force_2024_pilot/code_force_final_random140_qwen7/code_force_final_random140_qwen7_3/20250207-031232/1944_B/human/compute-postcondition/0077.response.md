Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, and `ans2` is a list with the element `c[2]` and `c[2]` appended.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `c[i]` refers to `c[2]`. Since `ans2` initially contains the element `c[2]`, after appending `c[2]` again, `ans2` will contain `c[2]` twice. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
