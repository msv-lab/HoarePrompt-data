Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 1) of list `l` to `ans2`. Since `i` is 1, `ans2` now contains the element at index 1 of list `l`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans1` remain unchanged.
