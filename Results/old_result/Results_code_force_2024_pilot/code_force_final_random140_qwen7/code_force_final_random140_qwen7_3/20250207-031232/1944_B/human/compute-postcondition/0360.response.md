Output State: **`sz` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since no changes were made to the variables `sz`, `i`, `rdb`, `n`, `rgt`, `ldb`, the values remain as they were in the initial state.
