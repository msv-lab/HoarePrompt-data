Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split(' ')`, `b` is a slice of `a` containing the sorted first `n` elements, `c` is a slice of `a` containing the remaining elements starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = []` initializes `ans2` as an empty list. This operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, `l`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
