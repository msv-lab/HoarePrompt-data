Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for elem in sng:`. The objects involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `elem` will take on values from the iterable `sng` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `sng` is an iterable that contains the elements that will be printed in pairs.

3. **Understand the context**:
   - All elements in `rdb` have been printed in pairs, meaning each element in `rdb` was printed twice.
   - `sz` is equal to 2 times the number of elements printed, indicating that `sz` is the total number of prints done.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over `sng`, `sng` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `elem` will be the first element of `sng` when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `sng` must contain at least one element.
- `elem` will be the first element of `sng`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`**.
