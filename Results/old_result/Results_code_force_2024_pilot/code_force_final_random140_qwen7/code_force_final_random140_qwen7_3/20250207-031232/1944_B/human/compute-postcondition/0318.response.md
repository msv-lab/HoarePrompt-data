Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(l)` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and continues to include `c[i]` for each iteration where `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the code, the variables retain their initial or previously calculated states, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional we were in.
