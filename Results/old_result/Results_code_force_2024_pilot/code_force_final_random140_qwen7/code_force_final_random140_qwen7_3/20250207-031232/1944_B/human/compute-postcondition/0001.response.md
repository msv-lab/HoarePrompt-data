Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `q` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `q < t`. For the loop to start executing, `t` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. Given that `t` is a positive integer, we can safely assume that `t` will always be at least 1 when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)**
