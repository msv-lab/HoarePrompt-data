Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is -1.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `ans1` contains all elements from `l`.
   - `ans2` now contains all elements from `l` as pairs.
   - `l` is an empty list.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Since `l` is an empty list, it contains no elements.
   - `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, so `ans1` is also an empty list.
   - `ans2` contains all elements from `l` as pairs. Since `l` is empty, `ans2` will also be an empty list because there are no elements to form pairs.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(*ans2)` will unpack the elements of `ans2` and print them separated by spaces.
   - Since `ans2` is an empty list, there are no elements to print.

Output: **[]**
