Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended with `c[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 1, it appends `c[1]` to `ans2`. Since `ans2` originally contained the value of `c[1]`, after appending `c[1]` again, `ans2` now contains `c[1]` twice. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
