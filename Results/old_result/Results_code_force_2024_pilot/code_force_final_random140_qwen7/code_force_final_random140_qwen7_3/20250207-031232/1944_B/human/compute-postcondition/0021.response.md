Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `b[i]` is equivalent to `b[1]`. Since no other changes occur to the variables `i`, `n`, `k`, or `b`, their states remain unchanged except for the addition of `b[1]` to `ans1`.
