Output State: **`sz` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` is empty, and `sng` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code sets `sz` to 0. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `rdb`, `n`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged from their initial states.
