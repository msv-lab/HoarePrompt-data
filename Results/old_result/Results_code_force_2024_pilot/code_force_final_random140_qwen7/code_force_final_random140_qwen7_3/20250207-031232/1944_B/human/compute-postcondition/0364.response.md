Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 0 or 2.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element.
- `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`.
- `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements.
- `ldb` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
- The most internal loop or if statement is exited if necessary.

The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`elem`**: The value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `rdb` contains consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, and `ldb` must contain at least one element, it implies that `elem` is one of the elements in `rdb`.

2. **`end=' '`**: This specifies that there should be a space after the printed elements instead of a new line.

Given that `rdb` contains consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, and considering the most internal loop or if statement is exited if necessary, `elem` would be the last repeated element in `rdb`.

However, without the exact sequence of `rgt` and the specific value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem`. But based on the structure, `elem` will be the same element printed twice.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is the last repeated element in `rdb`)
