Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `k` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - The loop variable `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`, so `i` will become `3`.

5. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 2, the loop can still execute if `i` is 3.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be updated to `3`.
   - `k` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop condition or loop body.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop condition or loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, and `k` is 0**
