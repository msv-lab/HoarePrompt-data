Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` was increased by 1 (though `sz` is not directly involved in the loop).
   - `sng` must contain at least two elements.
   - There is a condition to break out of the loop if the size of `sng` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is a variable used within the loop body, its value will change during each iteration but it does not affect the loop condition directly.
   - We need to ensure that `sng` still contains at least two elements for the loop to continue.
   - The size of `sng` should be less than 2 times `k` for the loop to continue, otherwise, the loop would have broken out.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` still contains at least two elements and its size is less than 2 times `k`.

**Final State**:
State: **`sz` is increased by 1, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and the size of `sng` must be less than 2 times `k`**
