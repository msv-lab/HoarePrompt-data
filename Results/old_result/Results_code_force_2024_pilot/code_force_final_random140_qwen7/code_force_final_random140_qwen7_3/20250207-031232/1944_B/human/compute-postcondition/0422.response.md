Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, and `elem` is the first element of `sng`; `sz` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the size of the list `sng` by 1. The precondition states that `sng` must contain at least one element and `elem` is the first element of `sng`. After executing `sz += 1`, the size of `sng` (denoted as `sz`) is increased by 1. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement (`sz >= 2 * k`) is not addressed in the given code snippet, so the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition is not met.
