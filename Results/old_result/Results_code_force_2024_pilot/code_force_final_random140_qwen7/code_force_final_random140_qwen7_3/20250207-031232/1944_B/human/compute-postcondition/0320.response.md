Output State: **`i` is 0; `len(l)` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0; `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` and includes the pair (l[0], l[0]); `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and continues to include `c[i]` for each iteration where `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`; `q` is 1; `req` is unchanged; `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the pair `(l[i], l[i])` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `l[i]` is `l[0]`, so the pair added to `ans1` is `(l[0], l[0])`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
