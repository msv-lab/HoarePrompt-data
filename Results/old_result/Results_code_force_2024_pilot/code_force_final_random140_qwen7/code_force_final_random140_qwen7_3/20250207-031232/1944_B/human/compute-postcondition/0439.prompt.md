Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lft = lst[:n]
    rgt = lst[n:]
    ldb = []
    rdb = []
    sng = []
    lft.sort()
    rgt.sort()
    if lft[0] != lft[1]:
        sng.append(lft[0])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
            ldb.append(lft[i])
        elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
            sng.append(lft[i])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
            rdb.append(rgt[i])
    sz = 0
    for elem in ldb:
        if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
        else:
            break
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= 2 * k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()
    sz = 0
    for elem in rdb:
        if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
        else:
            break
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= 2 * k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `sz` is the original size of `sng` plus 3, and `rdb` remains an empty iterable or has been fully iterated through.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 4.

Explanation: According to the initial state, after all iterations of the loop, `ldb` will be empty, `sz` will be exactly 4, and `rdb` will be empty. The value of `sz` is determined to be 4 because the loop breaks when `sz` reaches 2 * k, and from the information given, we know that after 3 iterations `sz` is 7, meaning `k` is 3.5 (since 2 * 3.5 = 7). Therefore, the loop will break when `sz` reaches 7, but since `sz` needs to be exactly 4 after all iterations, it means the loop does not continue beyond the point where `sz` is 4. Thus, the final state has `ldb` and `rdb` as empty, and `sz` as 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `sz` is less than 2 times `k`. After all iterations, `sz` will be equal to the minimum value between the length of `sng` and 2 times `k`. All elements in `sng` will have been printed up to the point where `sz` reaches 2 times `k`, or until all elements in `sng` have been printed. If `sng` has fewer elements than 2 times `k`, then all elements will be printed. If `sng` has more elements than or equal to 2 times `k`, then only enough elements will be printed to reach `sz` equal to 2 times `k`.

In simpler terms, all elements in `sng` will be printed up to but not exceeding the point where `sz` equals 2 times `k`, and `sz` will be exactly 2 times `k` if possible, or the total number of elements in `sng` if that number is less than 2 times `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
