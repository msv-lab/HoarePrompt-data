Output State: **`ans1` contains the element `l[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains the element `l[1]`, and `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, and `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
