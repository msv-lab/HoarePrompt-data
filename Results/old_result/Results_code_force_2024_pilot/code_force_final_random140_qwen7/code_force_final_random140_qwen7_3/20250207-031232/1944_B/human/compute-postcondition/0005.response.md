Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` creates a new list `c` that contains all the elements of list `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
