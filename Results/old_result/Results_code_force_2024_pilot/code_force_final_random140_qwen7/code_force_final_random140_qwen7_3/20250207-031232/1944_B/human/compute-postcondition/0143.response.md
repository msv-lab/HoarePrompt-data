Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` starts from 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is either -2 or 0 based on the condition of the if statement.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `i` increases by 1.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is either -2 or 0 (this state is not directly relevant to the loop head but might affect the loop body).

5. **Determine the next state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` is still greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
