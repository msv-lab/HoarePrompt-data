Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and `k` equals 0, and `l` contains `[b[2]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i - 1])` appends the element `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 3, `b[i - 1]` corresponds to `b[2]`. Therefore, `l` now contains the element `b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
