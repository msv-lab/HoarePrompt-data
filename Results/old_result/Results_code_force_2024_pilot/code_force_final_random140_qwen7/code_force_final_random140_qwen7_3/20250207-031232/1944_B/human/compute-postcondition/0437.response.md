Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `sz` is less than 2 times `k`. After all iterations, `sz` will be equal to the minimum value between the length of `sng` and 2 times `k`. All elements in `sng` will have been printed up to the point where `sz` reaches 2 times `k`, or until all elements in `sng` have been printed. If `sng` has fewer elements than 2 times `k`, then all elements will be printed. If `sng` has more elements than or equal to 2 times `k`, then only enough elements will be printed to reach `sz` equal to 2 times `k`.

In simpler terms, all elements in `sng` will be printed up to but not exceeding the point where `sz` equals 2 times `k`, and `sz` will be exactly 2 times `k` if possible, or the total number of elements in `sng` if that number is less than 2 times `k`.
