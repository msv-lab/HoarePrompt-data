Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 5000.
