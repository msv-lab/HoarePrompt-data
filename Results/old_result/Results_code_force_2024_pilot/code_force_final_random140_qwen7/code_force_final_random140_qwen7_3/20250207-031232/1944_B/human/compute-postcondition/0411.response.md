Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, and `sz` is its current value increased by 2**.

The code `sz += 2` increases the value of `sz` by 2. Since `sz` was either its current value or increased by 2 before this line, after executing this line, `sz` is now its current value increased by 2. The precondition that `rdb` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
