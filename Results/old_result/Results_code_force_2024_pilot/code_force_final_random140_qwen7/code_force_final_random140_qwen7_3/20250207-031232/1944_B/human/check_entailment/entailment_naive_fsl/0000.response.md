Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` will be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. The program attempts to create subsets `l` and `r` by sorting the first half and the second half of the array and then picking elements to ensure that `l` and `r` contain the same elements from the sorted halves. However, this approach does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` will be equal.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```
The program's output might be:
```
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```
However, the XOR of the elements in `l` (5 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 3) is 2, and the XOR of the elements in `r` (6 ^ 4 ^ 2 ^ 4) is 6. These values are not equal, which violates the requirement that the XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal. One way to achieve this is by using a more balanced approach to select elements from both halves of the array, ensuring that the XOR values match.
