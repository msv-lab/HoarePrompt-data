Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `ans1`; otherwise, no changes are made to `ans1`.**
