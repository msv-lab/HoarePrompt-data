Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `l` contains the value of `b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 1, `b[i - 1]` refers to `b[0]`. Therefore, `l` now contains the value of `b[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
