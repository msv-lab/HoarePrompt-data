Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is greater than 0; `ans2` has appended `c[3]` and now contains the element `c[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans2` will append `c[3]` to its existing elements. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` is greater than 0 still holds.
