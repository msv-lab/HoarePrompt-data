The function processes a series of test cases, each involving a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it identifies and prints two lists of integers. The first list contains all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from the first half of the input list, and the second list contains all elements from the second half of the input list where each element is a duplicate of its preceding element. The function handles up to 5000 test cases, where each test case involves a list size of up to 50,000 integers.
