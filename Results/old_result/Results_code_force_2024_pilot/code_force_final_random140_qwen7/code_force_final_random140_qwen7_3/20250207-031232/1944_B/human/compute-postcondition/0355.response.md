Output State: **`sz` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element, and (2 * k - sz) is less than 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement it is inside. Since no specific loop or if statement context was provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
