Output State: **`sz` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, `n` retains its original value representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`, `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements, `ldb` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element)**.

Explanation: The code `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. Given the initial state where `sz` is either 0 or 2, adding 2 to `sz` results in `sz` being 2. The values of the other variables (`i`, `rdb`, `n`, `rgt`, and `ldb`) remain unchanged as no operations affecting them are performed in the given code snippet.
