Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans1` contains all elements from `l` except the last one.
- `k` is 0.
- `ans2` contains all elements from `l` except the last one.
- `i` is equal to the length of `l`.

The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(l)`. Since `k` is never modified within the loop, it will always continue until `i` reaches the length of `l`. During each iteration, both `ans1` and `ans2` append `l[i]`, so they will both contain all elements of `l` except for the last one. After the loop ends, `i` will be equal to the length of `l`.

The `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements of `ans2` separated by spaces. Since `ans2` contains all elements of `l` except the last one, the output will be all elements of `l` except the last one.

Output: **all elements of l except the last one**
