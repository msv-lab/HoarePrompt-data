Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. `k` will be equal to its initial value minus 2 times the number of consecutive duplicates found in the list `b` up to index `n-1`. `ans1` will contain pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` up to index `n-1`, and `l` will contain all unique elements from `b` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans1`.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will have reached the last index it was incremented to, which is `n-1`. The variable `k` will reflect the total count of pairs of consecutive duplicates removed from `b` (each pair reduces `k` by 2). The list `ans1` will consist of all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements encountered in `b` up to the `(n-1)`th index. Lastly, the list `l` will include all unique elements from `b` up to the `(n-1)`th index that were not part of any pair in `ans1`.
