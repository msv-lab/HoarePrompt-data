Based on the initial state, `rdb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is either its current value or increased by 2. However, the specific value of `elem` is not provided. Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will represent it as a placeholder.

Given this, the print statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space, but since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we will denote it as `[elem]`.

Output: **[elem] [elem]**
