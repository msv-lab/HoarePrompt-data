Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `c[i]` is `c[1]`. Therefore, `ans2` now contains `c[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
