Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is increased by 2, and the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` remains true.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `rdb` must contain at least one element, and the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` must be true before the code is executed. After executing the code, `sz` is increased by 2, but the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` needs to remain true for the postcondition to hold.
