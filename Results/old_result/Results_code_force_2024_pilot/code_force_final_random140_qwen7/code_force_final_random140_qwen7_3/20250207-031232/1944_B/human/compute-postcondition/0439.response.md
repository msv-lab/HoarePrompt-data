Output State: `ldb` is an empty iterable, `rdb` is an empty iterable, `sz` is exactly 2 times `k`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `ldb` and `rdb` will both be empty because the loop processes all elements in `lft` and `rgt` lists, leaving no elements left to add to these iterables. The variable `sz` will be exactly 2 times `k` because the loop continues to print elements from `sng` and duplicate elements from `ldb` and `rdb` until `sz` reaches this value. Since the loop condition checks that `sz` is less than 2 times `k` before continuing, once `sz` reaches 2 times `k`, the loop will stop, ensuring that `sz` is precisely 2 times `k` at the end of all iterations.
