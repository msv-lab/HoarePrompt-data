Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or -2 depending on whether `c[2]` equals `c[1]`, and if `c[2]` equals `c[1]`, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[2]` appended with `c[2]` and `ans2.append(c[i])` has been executed.**

In this case, the code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` (which is `c[2]`) to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 2, the value of `c[2]` is appended to `ans2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
