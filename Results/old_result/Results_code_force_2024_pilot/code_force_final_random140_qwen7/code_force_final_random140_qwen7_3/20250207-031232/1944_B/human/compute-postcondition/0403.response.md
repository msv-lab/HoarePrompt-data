Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `elem in rdb`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `rdb`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `rdb`.
   - Inside the loop, there is a condition `if 2 * k - sz >= 2:` which checks if `sz` should be increased by 2.
   - If the condition is true, `sz` is increased by 2.
   - If the condition is false, the loop exits.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `rdb`, the variable `elem` will change with each iteration.
   - The variable `rdb` itself does not change; it remains the same list.
   - The variable `sz` could potentially change based on the condition inside the loop.

4. **Postcondition analysis**:
   - The postcondition given is that `rdb` must contain at least one element.
   - The condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` determines whether `sz` is incremented by 2.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - `rdb` must still contain at least one element.
   - `sz` could either remain the same or increase by 2 depending on the condition inside the loop.

Given that we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume that the loop continues unless the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` fails. Therefore, `sz` might increase by 2, but we cannot know the exact value without knowing the current value of `sz`.

**Final State**:
- `rdb` must still contain at least one element.
- `sz` could be its current value or increased by 2.

State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either its current value or increased by 2**
