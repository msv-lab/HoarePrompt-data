Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is unchanged, `k` is -2, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and now includes `c[i]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and `c[i]` is appended to `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `c[i]` refers to `c[2]`. Since no specific value for `c[2]` is provided, `c[2]` remains as it is, and it is appended to `ans2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
