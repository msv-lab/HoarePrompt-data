Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 1**

Explanation: The initial value of `i` is 3 and `k` remains unchanged. The code `k -= 2` subtracts 2 from the current value of `k`. Since no initial value for `k` was given, we assume it was initially set to a value that, when reduced by 2, results in the final value of 1. Therefore, `k` is now 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3.
