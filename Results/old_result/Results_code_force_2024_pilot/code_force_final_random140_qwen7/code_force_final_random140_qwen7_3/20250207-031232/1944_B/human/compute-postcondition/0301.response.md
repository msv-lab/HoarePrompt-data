Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is unchanged, `k` is -2, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
