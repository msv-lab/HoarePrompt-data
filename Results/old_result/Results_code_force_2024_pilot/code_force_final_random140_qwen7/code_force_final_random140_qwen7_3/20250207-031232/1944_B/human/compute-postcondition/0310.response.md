Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `k` is -4, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]` and now includes `c[i]`, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and `c[i]` is appended to `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `c[i]` refers to `c[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them.
