Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` except the last such element, and `n` will still be the input integer representing the length of the first segment of `rgt` used to form `rdb`. The variable `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the original sequence of elements.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be set to `n`, meaning the loop has iterated through all elements in `rgt` (from index 1 to `n-1`). The list `rdb` will include every element from `rgt` that is the same as the previous element, but it will not include the last such pair. The variable `n` will retain its original value, indicating the length of the segment of `rgt` considered by the loop.
