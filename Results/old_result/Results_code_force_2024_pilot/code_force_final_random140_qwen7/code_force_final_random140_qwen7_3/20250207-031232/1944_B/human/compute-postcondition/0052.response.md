Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` remains unchanged, and `l` has an additional element which is equal to `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `b[i-1]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is updated to 3, `b[i-1]` corresponds to `b[2]`. Since `k` remains unchanged and no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated value of `i`, the unchanged value of `k`, and the updated list `l` with the new element.
