Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` appended, `q` is 1, `req` is unchanged, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`, and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`**.

In this step, the code appends `c[i]` to `ans2`. Given that `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now contains `c[1]` appended to its previous contents. All other variables remain unchanged.
