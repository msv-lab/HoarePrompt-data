Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or -2 depending on whether `c[2]` equals `c[1]`, and `ans2` now contains the value of `c[2]` appended with `c[2]` and `ans2.append(c[i])` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` (which is `c[2]` since `i` is 2) to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 2, `c[2]` is appended to `ans2`. The other variables (`n`, `k`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
