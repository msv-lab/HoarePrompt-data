Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `k` equals 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
