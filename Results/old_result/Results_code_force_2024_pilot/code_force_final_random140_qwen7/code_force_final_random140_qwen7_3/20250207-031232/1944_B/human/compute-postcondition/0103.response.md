Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans1` contains the element `l[0]` from `l`, `ans2` now contains the elements `[l[0]]` from `l`, and `l` contains all unique elements from `c` up to index `n-1` that are not part of any pair in `ans2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` remain unchanged.
