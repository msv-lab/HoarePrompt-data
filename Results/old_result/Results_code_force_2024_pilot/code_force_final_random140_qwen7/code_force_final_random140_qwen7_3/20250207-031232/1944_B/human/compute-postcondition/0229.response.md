Output State: **`ans1` contains all elements from `l` except the last one, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains all elements from `l` except the last one, `i` is equal to the length of `l`, and `q` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `ans1`, `ans2`, `i`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
