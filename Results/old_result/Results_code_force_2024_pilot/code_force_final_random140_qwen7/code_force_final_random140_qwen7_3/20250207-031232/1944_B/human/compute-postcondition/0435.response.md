Output State: **`sz` is increased by 1, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and the size of `sng` must be less than 2 times `k`.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. The conditions regarding `sng` and `k` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these variables. Therefore, `sng` must still contain at least two elements, and its size must still be less than 2 times `k`.
