Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be at least 2, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2. Since `k` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be equal to `i`, which is initially 1. After decrementing, `k` becomes -1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
