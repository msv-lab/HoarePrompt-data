Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `ldb` will contain all the repeated elements from `lft` except the last one, `sng` will contain the unique elements from `lft` as they appear, and `n` will still be the input integer which represents the length of the first part of the list `lst` used to form `lft`.

In more detail:
- The variable `i` will reach the value of `n` after the loop completes all its iterations.
- The list `ldb` will store all elements from `lft` that are repeated consecutively, excluding the last such element.
- The list `sng` will contain all unique elements from `lft` in the order they appear.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and represents the length of the first segment of `lst` that was used to create `lft`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, the current value of `rdb` remains `[rgt[0]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then `rdb` remains `[rgt[0]]`. Otherwise, `rdb` becomes `[rgt[0], rgt[2]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and if `rgt[i]` equals `rgt[i - 1]`, then the element `rgt[i]` is appended to `rdb`. There is no additional change to the variables if the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
