Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `-2 * (n - 1)`, `ans1` is a list containing all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, `ans2` is a list containing all elements from `c[1]` onwards where each element is a duplicate of its preceding element, `q` is `t`, `req` is unchanged, `l` is an empty list.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `q` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs `t` times. The variable `i` will reach `n-1` as the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches the end of `l`. The value of `k` will be `-2 * (n - 1)` because `k` is initially set to `2 * k` (which is `2 * (n + k)`, but `k` is set to `2 * k` again before the loop starts), and it decreases by 2 with each iteration of the loop. `ans1` will contain all pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` found during the loop, and `ans2` will contain all elements from `c[1]` onwards where each element is a duplicate of its preceding element. Finally, `l` will be an empty list because no new elements are appended to it after the first three iterations.
