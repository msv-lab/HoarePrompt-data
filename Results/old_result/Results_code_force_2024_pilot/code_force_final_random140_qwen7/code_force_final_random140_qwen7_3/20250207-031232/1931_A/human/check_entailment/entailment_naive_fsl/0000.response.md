Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. Let's consider the encoded value `55` as an example:

- According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word for `55` should be `"czz"`, since `3 + 26 + 26 = 55`.
- However, the program incorrectly outputs `"aaz"` for `55`.

Here is the breakdown of the issue:
- The program logic does not account for the correct distribution of the encoded value across the three letters.
- It assumes a fixed pattern for the division of the encoded value among the three letters, which is not always accurate.

To fix this, a more detailed approach is needed to distribute the encoded value correctly among the three letters, ensuring the lexicographically smallest combination is generated.
