Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the given integer `n` into a three-letter word.
   - It uses a series of conditional statements to determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the value of `n // 26`.
   - However, the logic for determining the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` is flawed. Specifically:
     - When `n // 26 == 0`, it sets `a` and `b` to `'a'` and `c` to the character corresponding to `n - 2`. This is correct for some values of `n`, but not for others.
     - When `n // 26 == 1`, it sets `a` to `'a'`, `b` to the character corresponding to `n - 27`, and `c` to `'z'`. This is also correct for some values of `n`, but not for others.
     - When `n // 26 == 2`, it sets `a` to the character corresponding to `n - 52`, and `b` and `c` to `'z'`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Character Conversion**:
   - The program uses `chr(96 + 1)` to represent `'a'`, which is correct.
   - The logic for converting the remaining parts of `n` to characters is not always correct, especially for larger values of `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed word in the format `a + '' + b + '' + c`, which is correct for the intended output format.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all possible values of `n` and does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
