Output State: **The program returns a character between 'd' and 'z' inclusive**

Explanation: Given that `num` is an integer between 3 and 26 (inclusive), adding 96 to `num` results in a value between 99 and 122 (inclusive). These values correspond to the ASCII codes for characters from 'a' to 'z'. Specifically, when `num` is 3, `chr(num + 96)` returns 'd', and when `num` is 26, `chr(num + 96)` returns 'z'. Therefore, the program returns a character between 'd' and 'z' inclusive.
