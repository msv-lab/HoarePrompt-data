The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range of 3 to 78 inclusive. If `num` is between 1 and 26, it returns the corresponding lowercase letter from 'd' to 'z'. Otherwise, it does not perform any return action and leaves the program state unchanged. The function ultimately ensures that if a valid `num` is provided, it returns a character between 'd' and 'z' inclusive.
