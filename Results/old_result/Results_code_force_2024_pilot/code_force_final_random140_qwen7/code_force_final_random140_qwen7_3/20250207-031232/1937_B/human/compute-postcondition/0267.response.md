Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n \). It constructs a new string \( ans \) based on specific conditions involving characters from \( a \) and \( b \). Additionally, it counts the number of positions where \( a \) and \( b \) have consecutive matching '0' or '1' characters, printing both the constructed string \( ans \) and the count. The function prints these results for each test case and does not return any value.**
