Output State: **`work` is `False`, `i` is 1, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, and `ans` is the first character of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so it appends the first character of `b` to `ans`. After this operation, `i` is incremented (though not shown explicitly in the code, it's implied by the nature of the loop), making `i` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
