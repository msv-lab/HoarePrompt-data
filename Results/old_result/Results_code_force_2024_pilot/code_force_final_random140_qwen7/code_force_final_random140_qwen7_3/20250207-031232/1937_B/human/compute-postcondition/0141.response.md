Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 5; `ans` is increased by the value of `b[i-1]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes either 4 or 5 (depending on its initial value). The value of `ans` remains unchanged from the initial state because the code snippet does not modify `ans`. It only increments `i` by 1. Therefore, `ans` is still increased by the value of `b[i-1]`, where `i-1` would be 3 or 4 based on the new value of `i`.
