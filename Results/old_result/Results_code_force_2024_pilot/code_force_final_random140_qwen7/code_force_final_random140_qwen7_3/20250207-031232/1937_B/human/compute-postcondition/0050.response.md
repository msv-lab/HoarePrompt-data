Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 4; `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character; `b` is the stripped input from the next user input; `ans` is the first character of `a` plus `a[i]` (and possibly `b[i]` if `i` is 3); `work` remains the same as before; and len(`a`) must be at least 3.
