Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character; `b` is the stripped input from the next user input; `ans` is the first character of `a` plus `a[i]` plus `b[i]`; `work` remains the same as before; and len(`a`) must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` was originally the first character of `a` plus `a[i]`. After executing the code, `ans` now includes an additional character from `b` at the same index `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
