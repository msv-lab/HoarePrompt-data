Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 2 or 3), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` remains unchanged, `i` remains as 2 or 3, and `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i + 1` does not equal the length of `a`, then `i` becomes 3, and `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`. If the if condition is false, `i` becomes 2 or 3 depending on the initial value, and `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with the character `b[i-1]`.
