Based on the initial state provided:

- `work` is `False`
- `i` is `len(a)`
- `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
- `counter` is `1`
- `j` is `len(a)`
- `t` is an unspecified integer
- `ans` is a string containing characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop

The `print(counter)` statement will print the value of the `counter` variable, which is explicitly stated to be `1`.

Output: **1**
