Output State: **`work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 3 or 4), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string with `a[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character `a[i]` to the string `ans`. The values of `work`, `i`, `b`, `counter`, `j`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
