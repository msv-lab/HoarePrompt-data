Output State: **j is 2, counter is 2.**

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop iterates over the range of `len(a) - 1`. After three iterations, `j` would have incremented from 0 to 2. The value of `counter` is influenced by the conditions within the loop. From the provided output states, we can infer that the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` did not hold true for `j = 2`, as `counter` remained 2 instead of resetting to 1. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `j` will be 2 and `counter` will be 2.
