Postcondition: `work` is `False`, `i` is `len(a)`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is `1`, `j` is `len(a)`, `t` is an unspecified integer, and `ans` is a string containing characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, if `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is true (where `a[j + 1]` is `'0'` and `b[j]` is `'1'`). Otherwise, the values of `work`, `i`, `b`, `counter`, `j`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
