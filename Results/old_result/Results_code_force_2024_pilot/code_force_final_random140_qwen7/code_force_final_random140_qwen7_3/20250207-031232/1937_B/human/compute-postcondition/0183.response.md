Output State: **`work` is `True`, `i` is 1, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` must be `t - 1`, and `ans` is the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` is updated to be the first character of `a`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (assuming the loop continues and increments `i`). All other variables remain unchanged.
