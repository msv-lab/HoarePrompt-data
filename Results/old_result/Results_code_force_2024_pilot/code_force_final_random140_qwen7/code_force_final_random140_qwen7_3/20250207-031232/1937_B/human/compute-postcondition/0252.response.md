Output State: **`work` is `False`, `i` is `len(a)`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is 1, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is an unspecified integer, and `ans` is a string containing characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `counter = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `counter`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
