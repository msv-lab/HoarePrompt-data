Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 2 or 3), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string. If `work` is true and `i` is 1 or 2, then `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` if certain conditions are met, otherwise `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`. If `work` is true and `i` is 2 or 3, then `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i-1]`.
