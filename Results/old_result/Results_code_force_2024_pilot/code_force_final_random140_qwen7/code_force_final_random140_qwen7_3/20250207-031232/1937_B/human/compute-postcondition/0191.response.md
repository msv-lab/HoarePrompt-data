Output State: **`work` is `True`, `i` is 3, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` must be `t - 1`, and `ans` is the character `b[2]` appended to the string `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `ans` becomes `ans + b[2]`. Since `i` is incremented after this operation (though not shown explicitly in the snippet), `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
