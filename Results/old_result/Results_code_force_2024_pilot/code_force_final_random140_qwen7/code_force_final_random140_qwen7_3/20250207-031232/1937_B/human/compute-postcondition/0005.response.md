Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input**.

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes a new input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result to the variable `b`. The initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged.
