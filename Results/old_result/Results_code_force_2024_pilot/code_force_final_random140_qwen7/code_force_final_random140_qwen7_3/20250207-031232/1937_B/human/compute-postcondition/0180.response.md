Output State: **`work` is `True`, `i` is 0, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` must be `t - 1`, and `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `work = True` changes the value of the variable `work` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
