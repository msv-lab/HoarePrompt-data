Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `ans` plus `b[i]`, `work` remains the same as before, and `len(a)` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the `i-th` character of `b` to the end of `ans`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, the value of `ans` will be updated accordingly. The other variables (`a`, `work`, and `len(a)`) remain unchanged.
