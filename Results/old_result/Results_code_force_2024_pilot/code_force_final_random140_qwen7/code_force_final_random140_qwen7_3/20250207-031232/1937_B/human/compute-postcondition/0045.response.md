Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character; `b` is the stripped input from the next user input; `ans` is the first character of `a` plus `a[i]`; `work` remains the same as before; and len(`a`) must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` will be updated to include either `a[2]` or `a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
