Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `work` is True.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes the first character of `a`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code, it is implied by the nature of the operation in such contexts). All other variables remain unchanged.
