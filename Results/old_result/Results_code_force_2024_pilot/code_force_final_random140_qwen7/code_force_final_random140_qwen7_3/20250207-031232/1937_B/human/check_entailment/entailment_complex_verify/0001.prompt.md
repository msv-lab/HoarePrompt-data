You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

    #State: All variables outside the loop remain unchanged. After all iterations, `i` equals `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `j` equals `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is reset to `1` after each full iteration of `t`, and `ans` is a concatenated string based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n \). It constructs a new string \( ans \) based on specific conditions involving characters from \( a \) and \( b \). Additionally, it counts the number of positions where \( a \) and \( b \) have consecutive matching '0' or '1' characters, printing both the constructed string \( ans \) and the count. The function prints these results for each test case and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and the two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It uses a variable `work` to indicate whether the current character should come from `a` or `b`.
   - The loop iterates through the characters of `a` and `b`:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
     - It checks if the next character in `b` is smaller than the next character in `a`. If so, it switches to appending from `b` and sets `work` to `False`.
     - If no switch is needed, it continues appending from `a`.
     - If `work` is `False`, it appends the current character from `b` and sets `work` to `True`.

3. **Counting Paths:**
   - After constructing the lexicographically smallest path, the program counts the number of paths that yield this string.
   - It initializes a counter `counter` to 1.
   - It iterates through the characters of `a` and `b`:
     - If the next character in `a` is the same as the current character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the program against the example provided:

#### Test Case 1:
- `n = 2`
- `a = "00"`
- `b = "00"`

- The lexicographically smallest path is `"000"`.
- There are 2 paths that yield this string: `(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)` and `(1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)`.

#### Test Case 2:
- `n = 4`
- `a = "1101"`
- `b = "1100"`

- The lexicographically smallest path is `"11000"`.
- There is only 1 path that yields this string: `(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)`.

#### Test Case 3:
- `n = 8`
- `a = "00100111"`
- `b = "11101101"`

- The lexicographically smallest path is `"001001101"`.
- There are 4 paths that yield this string.

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest path and counts the number of such paths. Therefore, the program is correct.
