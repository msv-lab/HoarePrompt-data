Output State: **`work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 3 or 4), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, all the variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
