Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 1, 2, or 3), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string with the value of `a[i]` appended to it. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` remains unchanged, `i` remains as 1 or 2, and `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `i` becomes 3, and `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.
