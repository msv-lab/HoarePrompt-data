The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `len(a)` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the condition of the loop head.

State: **`i` is 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 0**
