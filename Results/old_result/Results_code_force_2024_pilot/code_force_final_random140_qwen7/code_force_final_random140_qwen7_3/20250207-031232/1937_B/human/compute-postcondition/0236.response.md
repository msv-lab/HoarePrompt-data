Output State: **`work` is `False`, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is 1, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an unspecified integer, and `ans` is a string containing characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

Explanation: The variable `counter` is explicitly set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
