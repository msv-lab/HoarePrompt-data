Postcondition: `work` is `True`, `i` is 1, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, and `ans` is the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`. The condition `(i + 1 >= len(a) or b[i] >= a[i + 1])` holds true.
