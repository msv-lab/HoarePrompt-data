Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is `b[0]`; `len(a)` is greater than 0; the condition `work` is false**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. The values of `ans`, `len(a)`, and the condition `work` remain unchanged from their initial states.
