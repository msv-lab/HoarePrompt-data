Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input, within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` remain unchanged
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: j is 2, counter is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final value of `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, `work` will be `False`, `j` will be `len(a) - 1`, and `ans` will be a concatenation of elements from both `a` and `b` based on the given conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `work` is `False`, `i` is `len(a)`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is `1`, `j` is `len(a)`, `t` is an unspecified integer, and `ans` is a string containing characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
