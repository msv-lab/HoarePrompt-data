Output State: **`j` is 2, `counter` is 2, `t` is 3, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `b`. The values of `j`, `counter`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
