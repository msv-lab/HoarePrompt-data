Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` will be a concatenation of elements from both `a` and `b` based on the given conditions, `work` is `False`, `j` is 0. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented to 2. If `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
