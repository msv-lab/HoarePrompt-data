Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans` is `ans + b[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The variable `ans` is updated by adding `b[i]` to its current value, where `i` is now 3. The conditions that determined the initial value of `ans` remain unchanged, so `ans` is now `ans + b[3]`.
