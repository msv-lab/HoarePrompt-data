Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head is `while i < len(a):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(a)` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is either `a[0]` (if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`), `a[0] + b[0]` (if `i + 1 == len(a)`), or `b[0]` (if the `work` condition is false).

3. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop can execute one more time as long as `len(a)` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a)` for the loop to continue.
   - Since `i` is already 1, `len(a)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `len(a)` must be greater than 1. No changes are needed for `i` since it is already set to 1 and will increment within the loop body.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is either `a[0]` (if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`), `a[0] + b[0]` (if `i + 1 == len(a)`), or `b[0]` (if the `work` condition is false).**
