Postcondition: `work` is `True` or `False`, `i` is either `2` or `1`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, and `ans` is a string that starts with the character `a[0]` and may include additional characters based on the conditions inside the if and else blocks. If `work` is `True`, `i` is set to `2` when certain conditions are met, and `ans` is updated accordingly. If `work` is `False`, `i` is `2`, and `ans` is the first character of `b`.
