Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 3 or 4), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string with `a[i]` appended to it. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `i` remains 4.
