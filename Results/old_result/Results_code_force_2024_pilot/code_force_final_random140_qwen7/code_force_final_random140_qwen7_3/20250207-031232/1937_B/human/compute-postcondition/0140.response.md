Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is increased by the value of `b[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `b[i]` to it. Since `i` is either 3 or 4, `b[i]` refers to either `b[3]` or `b[4]`. The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `b[i]`, but the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `ans` and the values of `b[3]` and `b[4]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, so it is still either 3 or 4.
