Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character; `b` is the stripped input from the next user input; `ans` is the first character of `a` plus `a[i]` plus `b[i]`; `work` remains the same as before.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a block of code. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` remain unchanged.
