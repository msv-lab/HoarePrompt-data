Output State: **`b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, `work` will be `False`, `j` will be `len(a) - 1`, `t` must be `t - 1`, and `ans` is an empty string.**

The code `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `b`, `counter`, `i`, `work`, `j`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
