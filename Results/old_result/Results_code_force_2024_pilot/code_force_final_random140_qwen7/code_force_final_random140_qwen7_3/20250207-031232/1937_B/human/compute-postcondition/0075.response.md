Output State: **`counter` is 1**.

Explanation: The initial state sets `j` to 1 and `counter` to either 2 if `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, otherwise `counter` remains 1. The code snippet simply assigns `counter` the value 1, overriding its previous value. Since the condition for setting `counter` to 2 based on the comparison between `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` is not met (as the assignment directly sets `counter` to 1), the value of `counter` is now 1.
