Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` will be a concatenation of elements from both `a` and `b` based on the given conditions, `work` is `False`, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Initially, `counter` was 1, so after executing this line, `counter` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`i`, `ans`, `work`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
