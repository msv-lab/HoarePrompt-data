Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input and must have at least one character, `b` is the stripped input from the next user input, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[i]`, `work` is True.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` concatenates the character at index `i` of `b` to the end of `ans`. Given that `i` is initially equal to the length of `a`, and since `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is set to be one more than the length of `a` (because string indices are zero-based). However, the code does not change `i`, so `i` remains equal to the length of `a`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the first character of `a` concatenated with the character at index `i` of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
