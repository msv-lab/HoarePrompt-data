Postcondition: `work` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (either 4 or 5), `b` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` is determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is the length of `b` minus 1, `t` is an integer, and `ans` is a string. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `work` remains False and `ans` is appended with `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `i` becomes 4 and `ans` is appended with `b[i-2]`.
