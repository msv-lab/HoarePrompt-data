Output State: **`j` is 1; `counter` is 2**

Explanation: The initial state is that `j` is 1, and `counter` is 1 if `a[1]` equals '0' and `b[0]` equals '1'; otherwise, `j` remains 1. The code snippet increments `counter` by 1. Since the condition for `counter` being 1 was already met (either `a[1]` is '0' and `b[0]` is '1', or `j` remained 1), `counter` is now 2. The value of `j` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
