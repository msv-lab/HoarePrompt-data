Postcondition: `work` is `True`, `i` is either 3 or incremented by 1, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `counter` will be determined by the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `t` must be `t - 1`, and `ans` is the character `a[0]` appended to the string `ans`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `i` is set to 3, and `ans` is updated to the character `b[2]` appended to the string `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.
