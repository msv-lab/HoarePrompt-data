Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is `ans + b[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `b[i]` to it. Since `i` is either 3 or 4, `b[i]` refers to either `b[3]` or `b[4]`. However, the exact values of `b[3]` and `b[4]` are not provided, so we keep it as `b[i]`. The initial state of `ans` is `ans + a[i]`, which means `ans` was already updated by adding `a[i]` to it. Now, it is further updated by adding `b[i]` to it. Therefore, the final state of `ans` is `ans + b[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is either 3 or 4.
