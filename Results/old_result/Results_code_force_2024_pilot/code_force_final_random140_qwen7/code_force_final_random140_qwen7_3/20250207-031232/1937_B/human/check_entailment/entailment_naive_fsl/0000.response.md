Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the grasshopper can choose between a '0' and a '1' in the same position from the top row and the bottom row. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Choices**: The program assumes that if `work` is `True`, it will always choose the character from the top row (`a[i]`). However, if the character in the bottom row (`b[i]`) is smaller, it should switch to the bottom row. This logic is flawed because it does not consider all possible paths and the lexicographical order correctly.

2. **Path Counting Logic**: The counting logic for the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is also incorrect. The program increments the counter based on certain conditions but does not fully account for all valid paths that could produce the smallest string.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
3
2
01
10
4
1101
1100
8
00100111
11101101
```

The expected output is:
```
000
2
11000
1
001001101
4
```

However, the provided program fails to produce the correct output for the second and third test cases. For instance, in the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string should be `11000`, and there should be only one path that yields this string. The program incorrectly counts the number of paths and does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest string.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
