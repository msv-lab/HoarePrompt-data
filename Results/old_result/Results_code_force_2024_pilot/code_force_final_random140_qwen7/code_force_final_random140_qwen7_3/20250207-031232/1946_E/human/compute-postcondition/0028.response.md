Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 3`, `i` is greater than 0, `cur` is `cur - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `nums_left` and the condition that `i` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is now greater than 0 (since it was initially greater than 1). The value of `cur` is updated to `cur - 1`.
