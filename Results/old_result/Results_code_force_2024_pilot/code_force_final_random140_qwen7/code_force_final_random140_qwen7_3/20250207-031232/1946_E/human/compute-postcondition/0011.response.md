Output State: **The program returns d which is a % b, and c - a // b * d, where c is b and d is a % b**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. From the initial state, we know `a` is a positive integer such that `a` >= `b`, `b` is a positive integer not equal to 0, and `a` is not divisible by `b`.
2. `c` is set to `b`, and `d` is set to `a % b`.
3. The code returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`.

Given these conditions:
- `d = a % b` (remainder when `a` is divided by `b`)
- `a // b` gives the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`
- `c - a // b * d` simplifies to `b - (a // b) * (a % b)` because `c` is `b`

Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a // b` is the largest integer less than or equal to `a / b`, and `a % b` is the remainder, which is non-zero.

Therefore, the final output is the remainder `d` and the expression `b - (a // b) * (a % b)`.
