Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums in a permutation.
   - We need to count the number of permutations that could have these prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A prefix maximum at index \(i\) means that the element at \(i\) is greater than all elements before it.
   - A suffix maximum at index \(j\) means that the element at \(j\) is greater than all elements after it.
   - The intersection of prefix and suffix maximums must be handled carefully, as they might overlap.

3. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - `func_2(a, b)` uses `func_1` to compute \(a \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

4. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - The function `func_2` correctly uses this inverse to perform modular arithmetic.

5. **Relevance to the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting permutations, which involves combinatorial logic rather than just modular arithmetic.
   - The given functions do not address the core combinatorial logic required to solve the problem.

6. **Missing Logic:**
   - The program does not implement any logic to count the permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It only provides utility functions for modular arithmetic, which are not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Conclusion

The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. It only provides utility functions for modular arithmetic but lacks the combinatorial logic needed to count the permutations.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
