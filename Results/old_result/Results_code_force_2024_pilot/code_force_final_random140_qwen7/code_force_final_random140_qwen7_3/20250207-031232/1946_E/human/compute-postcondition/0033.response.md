Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 2`, `i` is greater than 0, `ans` is updated according to the following rules: If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially greater than 1, after decrementing, `i` is now greater than 0. The value of `nums_left` is decreased by 1, making it `nums_left - 2`. The conditions for updating `ans` remain the same.
