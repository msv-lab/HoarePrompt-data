Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` (an integer) and `b` (a list of integers). It returns a tuple containing two integers, where the second element is the result of `c` multiplied by `a`, modulo 1000000007.**

Note: Here, `c` is implied to be an element from the list `b` that is a prime number, but the problem statement does not specify which element of `b` should be used. Therefore, the functionality description focuses on the return value based on the given constraints.
