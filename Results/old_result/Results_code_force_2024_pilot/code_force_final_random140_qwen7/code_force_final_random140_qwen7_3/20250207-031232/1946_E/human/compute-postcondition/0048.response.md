Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is equal to 1, `i` is equal to `R[0] + 1`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.**

Explanation: The code `i = R[0] + 1` updates the value of `i` to `R[0] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `nums_left`, `cur`, `ans`, and the conditions.
