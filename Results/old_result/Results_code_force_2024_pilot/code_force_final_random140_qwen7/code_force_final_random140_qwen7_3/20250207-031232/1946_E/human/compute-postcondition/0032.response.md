Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 1`, `i` is greater than 1, and `ans` is updated according to the following rules: If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. The other conditions and rules for updating `cur` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `nums_left` being reduced by 1, while the conditions and rules for `i` and `ans` stay the same as the initial postcondition.
