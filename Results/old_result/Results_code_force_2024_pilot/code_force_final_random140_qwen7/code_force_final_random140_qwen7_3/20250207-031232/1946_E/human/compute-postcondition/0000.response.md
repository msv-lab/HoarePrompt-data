Output State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers, c is an integer, d is a prime number (1000000007).**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, which returns a tuple of two integers. The first element of the tuple is assigned to `c`, and the second element, which is guaranteed to be a prime number (in this case, 1000000007), is assigned to `d`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
