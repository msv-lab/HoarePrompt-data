Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 2`, `i` must be greater than 1, `cur` is decremented by 1, `ans` is updated according to the following rules: If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `cur -= 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables (`nums_left`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The precondition that `i` must be greater than 1 and the rule for updating `ans` based on the value of `L[cur]` remains valid.
