Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is equal to either 1, 2, or 3, `i` is less than `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 3) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, `i` is increased by 1 and is less than `N`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` multiplies the current value of `ans` by `nums_left` and then takes the modulus with `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of `nums_left`, `cur`, `i`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, or the condition `L[-2] != R[1]`. It only updates the value of `ans`. Since `i` was already less than `N` and is increased by 1, the new state of `i` is still less than `N`.
