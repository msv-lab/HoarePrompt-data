Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is equal to either 1, 2, or 3, `i` is less than `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 3) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, and `i` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial states.
