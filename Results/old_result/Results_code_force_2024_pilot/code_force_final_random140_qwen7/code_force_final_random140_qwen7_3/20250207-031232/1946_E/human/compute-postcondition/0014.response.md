Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` such that `a >= b`. It returns a pair of integers based on certain conditions. Specifically:
- If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0).
- If `a` is less than `b`, it recursively calls itself with arguments `(b, a)` and returns the second value followed by the first value of that recursive call.
- If `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns (1, -(a // b - 1)).
- Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with arguments `(b, a % b)` and returns a pair of values derived from the result of that recursive call.**
