To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < N`.

Given the current state:
- `nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 2`
- `cur` is equal to either 1 or 2
- `i` is equal to `R[0] + 2`
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`
- The conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid
- `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < N` must be true. Given that `i` is currently equal to `R[0] + 2`, the loop will continue as long as `R[0] + 2 < N`.

Since `N` is already stated to be greater than `R[0] + 1`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` itself. We need to ensure that `i` is less than `N` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be less than `N`.

State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 2`, `cur` is equal to either 1 or 2, `i` is less than `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, and `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`**
