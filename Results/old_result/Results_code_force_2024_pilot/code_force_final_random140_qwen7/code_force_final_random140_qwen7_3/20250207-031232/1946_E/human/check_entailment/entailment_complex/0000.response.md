Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves reconstructing permutations based on given prefix and suffix maximum indices. The solution needs to count the number of possible permutations that match these constraints.

2. **Key Functions**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and also finds the coefficients (x and y) such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). However, the implementation seems to be incorrect as it doesn't follow the standard Extended Euclidean Algorithm pattern. It should return the GCD and the coefficients, but the logic is flawed.
   - **`func_2`**: This function uses `func_1` to compute a modular multiplicative inverse. However, since `func_1` is not implemented correctly, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the annotated code attempts to calculate the number of permutations using combinatorial methods based on the given prefix and suffix maximum indices. However, the use of `func_1` and `func_2` is problematic because:
     - `func_1` is not correctly implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
     - `func_2` relies on `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse, which is essential for the combinatorial calculations.
     - The combinatorial calculations themselves might be incorrect due to the reliance on flawed functions.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the core functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are not correctly implemented, the overall logic of the program is likely to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
