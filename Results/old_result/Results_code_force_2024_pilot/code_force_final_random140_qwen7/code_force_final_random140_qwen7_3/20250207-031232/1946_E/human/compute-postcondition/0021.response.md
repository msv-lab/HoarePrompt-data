Postcondition: `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers representing the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums respectively, `L` is updated to a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is now a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, and `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\); `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[-1]` is equal to `N`, `M1` is greater than 1, `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 2`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2, and `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.
