The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < N`. Right before the loop, `i` is equal to `R[0] + 1`, and `N` is not specified directly but can be inferred from the context.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `i` must be less than `N`. Given that `i` is initially set to `R[0] + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time, `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is equal to 1, `i` is equal to `R[0] + 1`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, and `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`.**
