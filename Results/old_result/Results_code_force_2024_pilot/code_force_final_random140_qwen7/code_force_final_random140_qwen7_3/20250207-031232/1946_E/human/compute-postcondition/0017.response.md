Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute the first time.

The loop is defined as:
```python
while i > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head condition is `i > 1`.

From the provided program state right before the loop:
- `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`
- `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation
- `M1` and `M2` are integers representing the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums respectively
- `L` is updated to a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order
- `R` is now a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order
- `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\)
- `L[0]` is equal to 1
- `R[-1]` is equal to `N`
- `M1` is greater than 1
- `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`
- `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 2`
- `i` is equal to `L[-1] - 1`

To determine if the loop can execute the first time, we need to check the value of `i`:
- `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 1. Given that `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`.

Since `L[-1]` is the last element in the list `L`, and `L` is a list of indices of prefix maximums, we don't need to adjust any other states except ensuring that `L[-1]` is appropriately set.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is to ensure that `L[-1]` is greater than 2 (since `L[-1] - 1 > 1` implies `L[-1] > 2`).

State: **`cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers representing the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums respectively, `L` is updated to a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is now a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, and `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\); `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[-1]` is equal to `N`, `M1` is greater than 1, `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 2`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2**
