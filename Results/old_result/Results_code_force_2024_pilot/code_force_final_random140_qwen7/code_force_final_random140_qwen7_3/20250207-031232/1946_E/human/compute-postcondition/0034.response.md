Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 2`.
   - `i` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is updated based on the rules provided.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i > 1` must be true at the start of the next iteration.
   - Currently, `i` is greater than 0, but we need to ensure that `i` is greater than 1 for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is decremented within the loop (though not shown explicitly in the given state), we need to ensure that `i` is initially greater than 1.

Given the current state:
- `i` is greater than 0, but we need to ensure it is greater than 1.
- `nums_left` and `ans` do not directly affect the loop condition `i > 1`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i` to ensure it is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 2`, `i` must be greater than 1, `ans` is updated according to the following rules: If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**
