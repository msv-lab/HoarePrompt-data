Output State: **`a` is a positive integer less than `b`, `b` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a)`'s first return value, and `d` is the result of `func_1(b, a)`'s second return value.**

This means that the function `func_1(b, a)` has been called with `b` and `a` as arguments, and it has returned two values which are assigned to `c` and `d` respectively. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
