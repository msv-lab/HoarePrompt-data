Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 3`.
   - `cur` is equal to either 1, 2, or 3.
   - `i` is less than `N`.
   - `ans` is computed based on certain conditions.
   - Conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, and `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < N`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `N` for the loop to continue. Since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that after incrementing `i`, it is still less than `N`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `N` after the increment.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is equal to either 1, 2, or 3, `i` is less than `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 3) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, and `i` is increased by 1 to be less than `N`**.
