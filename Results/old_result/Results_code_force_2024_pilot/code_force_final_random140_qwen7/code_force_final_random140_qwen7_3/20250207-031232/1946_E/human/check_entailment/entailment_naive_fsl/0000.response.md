Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not appear to be related to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, they seem to be implementing some form of extended Euclidean algorithm, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

To solve the problem, we would need to construct permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums and ensure that the constraints are met. The provided code does not attempt to construct such permutations or handle the necessary logic to count them correctly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
