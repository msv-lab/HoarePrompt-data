The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was equal to `R[0] + 1`. After incrementing, `i` becomes `R[0] + 2`. The other variables (`nums_left`, `cur`, `ans`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `N`) remain unchanged and satisfy their respective conditions.

Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 2`, `cur` is equal to either 1 or 2, `i` is equal to `R[0] + 2`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, and `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`.**
