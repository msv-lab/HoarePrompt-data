Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers representing the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums respectively, `L` is updated to a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is now a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, and `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\); `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[-1]` is equal to `N`; `M1` is greater than 1; `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 2`; `i` is equal to `L[-1] - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 3`, `i` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 2`, `i` is greater than 0, `ans` is updated according to the following rules: If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nums_left` is equal to `nums_left - 4`, `i` is `i - 1`, `cur` is unchanged, `ans` is updated according to the rule: `ans = ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 3) % MOD`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
