Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.
2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 3`
   - `i` is decreased by 1

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i > 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1.

Given that `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `i` is greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is greater than 1.
   - The value of `nums_left` does not affect the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - 3`, `i` must be greater than 1**
