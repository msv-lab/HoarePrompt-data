You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            
            nums_left -= 1

        #State: Output State: `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - (3 * (N - 2))`, `i` is equal to `1 - N`, `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, `ans` is the final value calculated after all iterations, which is the product of `ans` and `nums_left` reduced by 1 modulo `MOD` each time `i` does not equal `L[cur]`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues until `i` becomes less than or equal to 1. Given that `i` starts from `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration, it will take `L[-1] - 1 - 1 = L[-1] - 2` iterations to reach 1. Since `L[-1] = N - 1` (from the initial conditions), the total number of iterations is `N - 3`. Each iteration reduces `nums_left` by 1, starting from `L[-1] - 2`. Therefore, after all iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - 2 - (N - 3) = L[-1] - N + 1 = (N - 1) - N + 1 = N - 2 - 1 = N - 3`. However, since `nums_left` is initialized as `L[-1] - 2`, the correct calculation should be `L[-1] - 2 - (N - 3) = N - 3`. Also, `i` will be `1 - N` after the loop completes its iterations. The value of `cur` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `ans` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, but the exact value depends on the specific sequence of operations during each iteration.
    #State: `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers representing the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums respectively, `L` is updated to a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is now a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, and `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\); `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[-1]` is equal to `N`; either `M1` is less than or equal to 1 or `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, then after executing the loop, `nums_left` is equal to `N - 3`, `i` is equal to `1 - N`, `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, and `ans` is the final value calculated after all iterations, which is the product of `ans` and `nums_left` reduced by 1 modulo `MOD` each time `i` does not equal `L[cur]`.
    nums_left = N - R[0] - 1
    if (M2 > 1) :
        cur = 1
        i = R[0] + 1
        while i < N:
            if i == R[cur]:
                cur += 1
            else:
                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            
            nums_left -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - (N - R[0])`, `cur` is equal to a value between 1 and `N - R[0]`, `i` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) * ... * 1 % MOD` if `i` is not equal to any `R[cur]` during the loop, or a product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and some `nums_left` values if `i` equals any `R[cur]` during the loop, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.
        #
        #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `nums_left` will be reduced by one for each iteration until it reaches `N - R[0] - (N - R[0]) = 0`. The variable `cur` will increment up to a value that is within the range of indices for `R`. The variable `i` will increment until it reaches `N`. The variable `ans` will be updated in each iteration based on whether `i` equals `R[cur]`. If `i` does not equal `R[cur]`, `ans` is updated by multiplying with `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, `ans` is updated without reducing `nums_left`. The final value of `ans` will be the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and a series of `nums_left` values, depending on how many times `i` matched `R[cur]` during the loop.
    #State: `nums_left` is equal to 0, `cur` is a value between 1 and `N - R[0]`, `i` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) * ... * 1 % MOD` if `i` is not equal to any `R[cur]` during the loop, or a product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and some `nums_left` values if `i` equals any `R[cur]` during the loop, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) * ... * 1 % MOD` if `i` is not equal to any `R[cur]` during the loop, or a product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and some `nums_left` values if `i` equals any `R[cur]` during the loop, under the conditions that `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, and `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the results of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the lists `L` and `R` with their respective lengths `M1` and `M2`, and the constant `MOD`. It returns 0 in three cases and `ans`, which is calculated based on specific conditions involving the lists `L` and `R`, in the fourth case.
