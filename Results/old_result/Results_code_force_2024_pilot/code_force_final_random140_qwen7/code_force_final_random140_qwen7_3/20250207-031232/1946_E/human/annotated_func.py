#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` such that `a >= b`. It returns a pair of integers based on certain conditions. Specifically:
- If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0).
- If `a` is less than `b`, it recursively calls itself with arguments `(b, a)` and returns the second value followed by the first value of that recursive call.
- If `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns (1, -(a // b - 1)).
- Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with arguments `(b, a % b)` and returns a pair of values derived from the result of that recursive call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is a list of integers, and the function `func_1` takes a list of integers and an integer as arguments, returning a tuple of two integers where the second element is a prime number (10^9 + 7 in this context).
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the value of c multiplied by a, modulo 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` (an integer) and `b` (a list of integers). It calls another function `func_1` with `b` and a prime number (10^9 + 7) as arguments. After obtaining the result from `func_1`, which is a tuple containing two integers, the function multiplies the first element of the tuple by `a`, then takes the result modulo 1000000007. The function returns this final computed value.
