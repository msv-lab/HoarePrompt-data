Functionality: **The function checks several conditions involving the lists `L` and `R` and the integer `MOD`. If any of the specified conditions are not met, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` using `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and updates `ans` based on the elements in `L` and `R`. The final value of `ans` is returned, which is a product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and other values derived from `L` and `R`, all taken modulo `MOD`.**
