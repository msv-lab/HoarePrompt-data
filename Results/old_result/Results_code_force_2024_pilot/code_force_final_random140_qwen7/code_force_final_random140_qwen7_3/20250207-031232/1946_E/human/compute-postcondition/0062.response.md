Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 2`, `cur` is equal to either 1 or 2, `i` is less than `N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, or `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid, and `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` multiplies the current value of `ans` by `nums_left` and then takes the modulo `MOD`. This updates the value of `ans` but does not affect the other variables. The conditions and values of `nums_left`, `cur`, `i`, `ans`, `M1`, `M2`, `L[-2]`, `R[0]`, `R[cur]`, `L[-1]`, and `N` remain the same as before, except for the updated value of `ans`.
