Output State: `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - (3 * (N - 2))`, `i` is equal to `1 - N`, `cur` is equal to `M1 - 2`, `ans` is the final value calculated after all iterations, which is the product of `ans` and `nums_left` reduced by 1 modulo `MOD` each time `i` does not equal `L[cur]`.

Explanation: The loop continues until `i` becomes less than or equal to 1. Given that `i` starts from `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration, it will take `L[-1] - 1 - 1 = L[-1] - 2` iterations to reach 1. Since `L[-1] = N - 1` (from the initial conditions), the total number of iterations is `N - 3`. Each iteration reduces `nums_left` by 1, starting from `L[-1] - 2`. Therefore, after all iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - 2 - (N - 3) = L[-1] - N + 1 = (N - 1) - N + 1 = N - 2 - 1 = N - 3`. However, since `nums_left` is initialized as `L[-1] - 2`, the correct calculation should be `L[-1] - 2 - (N - 3) = N - 3`. Also, `i` will be `1 - N` after the loop completes its iterations. The value of `cur` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `ans` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, but the exact value depends on the specific sequence of operations during each iteration.
