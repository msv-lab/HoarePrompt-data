Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, `i` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. The value of `nums_left` is initially defined as `L[-1] - 3`. The condition that `i` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
