Output State: **`nums_left` is equal to `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is equal to 1, `i` is equal to `1 - N`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and the conditions `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, `L[-2] != R[1]` are still valid.**

Explanation: The code `cur = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `cur`. Since `cur` was previously equal to `M1 - 2`, and now it is explicitly set to 1, the value of `cur` is updated to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged according to the initial state.
