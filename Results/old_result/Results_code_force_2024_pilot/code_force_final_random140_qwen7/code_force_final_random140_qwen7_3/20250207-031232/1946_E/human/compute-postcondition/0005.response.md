Output State: **The program returns the second return value of func_1(b, a) and the first return value of func_1(b, a)**

This means that the function `func_1(b, a)` was called with `b` as the first argument and `a` as the second argument. Since `func_1(b, a)` returns two values (a tuple), the program returns these two values as specified.
