Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that `a` >= `b`, `b` is a positive integer not equal to 0, and `a` is not divisible by `b`; `c` is `b`, `d` is `a % b`.**

Explanation: The code `c, d = func_1(b, a % b)` calls a function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a % b`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we assume it returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`. Given the initial conditions, `b` remains unchanged, and `a % b` (which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`) is assigned to `d`. The value of `c` is set to `b`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
