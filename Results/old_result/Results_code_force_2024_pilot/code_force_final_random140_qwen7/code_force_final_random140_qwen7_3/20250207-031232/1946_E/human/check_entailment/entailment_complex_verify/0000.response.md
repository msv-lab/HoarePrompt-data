### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided as indices in increasing order.
   - The solution must consider these constraints and compute the number of valid permutations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo a prime. However, this is not directly related to solving the permutation problem.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function uses the result from `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of a number. Again, this is not directly related to the permutation problem.
   - **Main Code**:
     - **Initialization**: 
       - Precomputes factorials up to 200,000 and stores them in the `facts` list.
       - Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
     - **Test Case Processing**:
       - Reads \( n \), \( m1 \), and \( m2 \) (length of permutation, number of prefix maximums, and number of suffix maximums).
       - Reads the indices of prefix maximums (`p`) and suffix maximums (`s`).
       - Checks if the first and last elements of `p` and `s` match the required conditions (prefix and suffix maximums).
       - If the conditions are not met, prints 0.
       - Otherwise, initializes `ans` to 1 and `kol` to \( n \).
       - Iterates through the suffix maximums and computes combinations using `func_2`.
       - Reverses the prefix maximums and iterates through them, computing combinations again.
       - Prints the result.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The main logic in the program seems to involve computing combinations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The use of precomputed factorials and the combination formula suggests an attempt to count permutations that satisfy the given constraints.
   - The checks for the first and last elements of `p` and `s` ensure that the permutation starts and ends correctly.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program does indeed attempt to count permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The use of combinations and precomputed factorials is a valid approach to solving this problem.
   - The checks for the first and last elements ensure that the permutation constraints are met.
   - The overall logic aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is incorrect. The program does correctly implement the logic to count permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
