### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to count the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy the given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums. This involves understanding the positions of these maximums and ensuring that the permutations adhere to these constraints.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and also finds the coefficients `c` and `d` such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \).
   - The function `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using the result from `func_1`.
   - The function then returns the result of multiplying `a` by this inverse and taking the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Given the problem statement, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be directly related to solving the permutation problem. However, let's consider if there might be a way to use these functions in the context of the problem.

#### Revisiting the Problem:
To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the positions of prefix and suffix maximums.
2. Construct permutations that satisfy these conditions.
3. Count the number of such permutations.

The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly help in constructing or counting permutations. They are more likely used for other mathematical operations, possibly in a different part of the solution that is not shown here.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
