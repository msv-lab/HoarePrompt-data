Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with the first element being 0, followed by integers obtained from the input split. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
