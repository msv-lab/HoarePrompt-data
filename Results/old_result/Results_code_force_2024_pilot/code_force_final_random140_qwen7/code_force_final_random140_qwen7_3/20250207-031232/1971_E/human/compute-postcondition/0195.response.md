Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for l in range(q)`. The only variable in the loop head is `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `l`**: At the start of the first iteration, `l` is set to 0 because `range(q)` generates values from 0 to `q-1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `l < q`.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `m` is `1 + (bd[s] * ql) // ad[s]`
   - `i` is 1
   - `q` is `len(a) - 1`
   - `ad` and `bd` are unchanged
   - `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`
   - `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since the loop is iterating over `l` in the range `range(q)`, at the end of the previous iteration, `l` was `q-1`. For the next iteration, `l` should be `q-1 + 1 = q`.

6. **State adjustment**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`m` is `1 + (bd[s] * ql) // ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`, `l` is `q`**
