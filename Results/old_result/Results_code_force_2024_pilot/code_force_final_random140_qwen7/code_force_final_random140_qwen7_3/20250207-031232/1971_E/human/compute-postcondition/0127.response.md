Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the result of bisect_left(a, ql)**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
