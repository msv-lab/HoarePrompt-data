Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and the current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `m`, `i`, `s`, and the condition related to `a` remain unchanged.
