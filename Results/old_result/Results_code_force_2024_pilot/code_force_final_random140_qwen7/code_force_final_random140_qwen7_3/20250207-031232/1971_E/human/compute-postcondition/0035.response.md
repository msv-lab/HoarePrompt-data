Output State: **`v` contains the values `[ad[1]/bd[1], ad[2]/bd[2], ad[3]/bd[3], ..., ad[len(a)-1]/bd[len(a)-1]]`, `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged, `i` is 1, `m` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `ql` is an input integer.**

The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `ql`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
