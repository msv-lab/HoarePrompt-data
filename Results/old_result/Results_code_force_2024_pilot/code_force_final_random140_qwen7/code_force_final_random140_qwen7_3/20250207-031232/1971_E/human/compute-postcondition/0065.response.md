Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `q` is unchanged, `m` is 0, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. No variables are updated or affected by this statement, so their previous values remain unchanged.
