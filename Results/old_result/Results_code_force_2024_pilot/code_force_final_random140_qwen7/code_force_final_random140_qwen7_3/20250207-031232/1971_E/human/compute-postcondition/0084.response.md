Output State: **`a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements, and the next difference will be between `a[2]` and `a[1]`; `ad` has an additional element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.**

This means that the code appends the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of the list `a` to the list `ad`. The list `a` remains unchanged except for the implicit use of its elements to compute the new difference. The list `ad` now contains one more element representing this difference.
