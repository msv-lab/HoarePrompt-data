Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` because `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
   - `a` retains its original values.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` is now `i + 2` (since it was already `i + 1` and then incremented by `1`).

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `ad` will have another element added, which will be `a[i] - a[i - 1]` where `i` is now `i + 2`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `i` needs to be set to `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `a` retains its original values, and `i` is `i + 2`**.
