Output State: **`m` is `1 + (bd[s] * ql) // ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is updated by adding the result of `bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `s` remains the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`.
