Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `q` is unchanged, `m` is 0, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `ql -= a[s - 1]` subtracts the value of `a[s - 1]` from `ql`. Since `a[s]` equals `ql` and we continue with the next iteration of the loop only if `a[s]` equals `ql`, no changes occur in this iteration. Therefore, the values of `i`, `l`, `q`, and `m` remain unchanged, and `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
