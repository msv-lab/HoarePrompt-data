Output State: **`v` contains the values `[ad[1]/bd[1], ad[2]/bd[2], ad[3]/bd[3], ..., ad[len(a)-1]/bd[len(a)-1]]`, `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged, `i` is 1, `m` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `ql` in the list `a`. This insertion point is the smallest index `s` such that `a[s] >= ql`. The values of `v`, `ad`, `bd`, `i`, `m`, `q`, and `ql` remain unchanged except that `s` is now set to this index.
