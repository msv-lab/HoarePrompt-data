Output State: **`a` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 3, `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[3] - b[2] + b[3] - b[2]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` translates to `b[3] - b[2]`. Since `bd` initially had an additional element which was `b[3] - b[2]`, appending the same value again results in `bd` having two occurrences of `b[3] - b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
