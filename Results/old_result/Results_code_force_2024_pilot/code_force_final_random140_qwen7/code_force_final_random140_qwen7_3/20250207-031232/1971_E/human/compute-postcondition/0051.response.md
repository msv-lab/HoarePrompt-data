Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1.
- `ql` is an input integer.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(b[s], end=' ')`.

However, there are a few issues with the initial state and the print statement:
1. There is no list `a` mentioned in the initial state.
2. There is no list `b` mentioned in the initial state.
3. The variable `b` and the index `s` are used in the print statement, but they are not defined in the initial state.

Since the initial state does not provide any information about `b` or `s`, and these variables are not defined in the given context, it is impossible to determine the exact value that will be printed.

Therefore, based on the given information, the output cannot be precisely determined.

Output: **Cannot be determined**
