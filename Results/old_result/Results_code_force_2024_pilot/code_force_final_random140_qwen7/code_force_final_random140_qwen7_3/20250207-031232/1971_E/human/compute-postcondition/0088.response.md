Output State: `a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that contains the differences between every pair of consecutive elements in `a`, ending with the difference between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]`. The length of `ad` is `len(a) - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ad` will have been populated with the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the original list `a`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`, appending the difference `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to `ad` in each iteration. Therefore, `ad` will contain `len(a) - 1` elements, each representing the difference between two consecutive elements in `a`.
