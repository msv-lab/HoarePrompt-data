Output: **()**

Explanation: The `print()` function without any arguments prints an empty tuple, but in Python, printing an empty tuple is represented by just `()` or nothing if you prefer a more concise representation. Given the initial state and the operations described, none of the variables or objects are printed directly inside the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply an empty print statement, which results in no visible output or an empty tuple representation.
