Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that contains the differences between every pair of consecutive elements in `a`, ending with the difference between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]`. The length of `ad` is `len(a) - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ad` will have been populated with the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the original list `a`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`, appending the difference `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to `ad` in each iteration. Therefore, `ad` will contain `len(a) - 1` elements, each representing the difference between two consecutive elements in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 1, `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 2, `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[2] - b[1]`, and `bd` now includes `b[i] - b[i - 1]` which is `b[2] - b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 3, `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[3] - b[2] + b[3] - b[2]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
