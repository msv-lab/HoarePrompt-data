Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` is increased by `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`; `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` to its current value, which was already increased by `b[s - 1]`. The value of `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
