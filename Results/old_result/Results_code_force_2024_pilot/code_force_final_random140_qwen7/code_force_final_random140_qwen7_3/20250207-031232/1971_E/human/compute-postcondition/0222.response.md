Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop has executed `q` times.
- `m` is calculated as `1 + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
- The value of `i` is 1.
- `q` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.
- `ql` is the final input integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`.
- `l` is 0 since the loop has completed all its iterations.

The `print()` statement without any arguments will simply print an empty line.

Output: **Output:**
