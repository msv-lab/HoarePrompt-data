Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list with more than one element.
   - `ad` is a list that includes an additional element which is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of `a` (exclusive).

3. **Loop Variables:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(a) - 1`.

4. **What Changes in Each Iteration:**
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The value added to `ad` is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` where `1 <= k < len(a)`.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(a)`.

6. **New State:**
   - `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `ad` will include the difference between `a[k + 1]` and `a[k]`.

Given this analysis, let's formulate the new state:

- Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
- `ad` will now include the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.

Therefore, the new state is:

State: **`a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that includes the differences between consecutive elements starting from the first difference.** 

To be specific about the values:
- `i` will be 2.
- `ad` will include the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, and the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that includes the differences between consecutive elements starting from the first difference, and the next difference will be between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.** 

In a more concise form:

State: **`a` is a list with more than one element; `ad` is a list that includes the differences between consecutive elements, and the next difference will be between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.**
