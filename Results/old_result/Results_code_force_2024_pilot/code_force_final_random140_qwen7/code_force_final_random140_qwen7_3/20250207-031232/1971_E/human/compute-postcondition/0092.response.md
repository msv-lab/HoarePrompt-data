Output State: **`a` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 2, `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[2] - b[1]`, and `bd` now includes `b[i] - b[i - 1]` which is `b[2] - b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` evaluates to `b[2] - b[1]`. This value is appended to `bd`, so the updated state of `bd` includes both its original element (`b[2] - b[1]`) and the newly added element (`b[2] - b[1]`). The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
