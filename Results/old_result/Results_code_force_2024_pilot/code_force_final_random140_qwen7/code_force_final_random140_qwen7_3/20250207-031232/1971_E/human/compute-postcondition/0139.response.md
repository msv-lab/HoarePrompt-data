To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ql` is an input integer.
   - `l` is `ql + 1`.
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`. Here, `a` is an implicit list, but we need more information about `a` to proceed. Since no specific details about `a` are provided, we'll assume `a` is a sorted list of integers.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(b[s], end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to understand the role of `b` and `s`.

- `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which returns the index where `ql` would be inserted into the list `a` to maintain sorted order. 

Since `a` is not specified, we can only describe `s` in terms of its relationship to `a` and `ql`.

Therefore, the output will be the element at index `s` in the list `b`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **b[s]**
