Output State: **`v` now contains `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]` and `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `i` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `len(b)` is at least `1` and less than `len(a)`**.

Explanation: The code appends `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Initially, `v` contains `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`. After executing the code, `v` will contain both `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]` and `ad[i] / bd[i]`. The conditions on `i` and the lengths of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
