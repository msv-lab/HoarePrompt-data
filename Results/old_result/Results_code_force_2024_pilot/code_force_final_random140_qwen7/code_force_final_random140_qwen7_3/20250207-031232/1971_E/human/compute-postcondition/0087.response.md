Output State: `ad` is a list containing the differences between all consecutive elements in the list `a`. Specifically, `ad` will include `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., up to `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`. The lengths of both `a` and `ad` will be the same, with `len(ad)` being equal to `len(a) - 1`. All other variables (`i`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, `q`, `v`, `bd`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
