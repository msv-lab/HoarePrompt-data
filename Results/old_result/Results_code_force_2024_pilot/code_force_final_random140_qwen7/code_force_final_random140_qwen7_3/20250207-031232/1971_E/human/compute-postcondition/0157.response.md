Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` is less than `len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 (assuming `len(a)` is greater than 2). Therefore, `i` should be set to 2.

5. **Keep Other States Unchanged**: The list `ad` is not part of the loop head and its value does not change based on the loop condition. Hence, it remains unchanged.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`**.
