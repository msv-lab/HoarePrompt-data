To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the formula for `m`.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `v` is a list of ratios calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
   - `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (input integer - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into the list `a` to keep it sorted.
   - If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `i`, `m`, or `q`.

2. **Understanding `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated using the formula `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (input integer - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
   - Here, `b[s - 1]` is a value from the list `b` at index `s - 1`.
   - `bd[s]` is a value from the list `bd` at index `s`.
   - `(input integer - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` is the integer division of the difference between the input integer and `a[s - 1]` by `ad[s]`.

Given this information, the value of `m` depends on the specific values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `input integer`, `a[s - 1]`, and `ad[s]`. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe `m` in terms of these variables.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **m (where m is b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (input integer - a[s - 1]) // ad[s])**
