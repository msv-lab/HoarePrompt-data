Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i`. The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` contains the value `ad[i] / bd[i]`.
   - `i` is within the range `1` to `len(a)`.
   - `len(b)` is at least `1` and less than `len(a)`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1` and still be within the valid range.
   - Therefore, `i` will now be `i + 1`.

5. **Check the constraints**:
   - `len(b)` remains the same and must still be at least `1` and less than `len(a)`.
   - The value of `v` is recalculated based on the new `i` value, but its exact value is not specified in the loop body, so we don't need to change it explicitly.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1`, so if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k + 1`.
   - `v` will be updated to `ad[i] / bd[i]` with the new `i`.
   - `len(b)` remains the same and must still be at least `1` and less than `len(a)`.

Given the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`v` contains the value `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`, `i` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `len(b)` is at least `1` and less than `len(a)`**.
