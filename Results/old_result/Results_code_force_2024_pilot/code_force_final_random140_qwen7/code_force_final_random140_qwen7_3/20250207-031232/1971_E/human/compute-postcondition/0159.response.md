Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `len(a)` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` becomes 3
   - `ad` remains unchanged (it still contains the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`**
