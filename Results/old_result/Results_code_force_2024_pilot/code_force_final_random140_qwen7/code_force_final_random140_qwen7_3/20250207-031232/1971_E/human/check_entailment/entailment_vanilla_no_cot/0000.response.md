Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`, followed by the positions `a` and times `b`.

2. **Calculating Speeds**: It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and then computes the speeds between these points.

3. **Query Handling**: For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment where the queried point `d` lies. If `d` exactly matches a known point, it directly outputs the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to travel from the previous known point to `d` using the calculated speed.

4. **Output**: The program prints the time for each query as required.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program should work correctly for the described problem.
