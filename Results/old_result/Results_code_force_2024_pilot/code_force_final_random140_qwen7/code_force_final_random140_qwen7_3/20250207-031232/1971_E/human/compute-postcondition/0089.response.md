Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `b`. However, since `b` is not mentioned in the initial state and the loop is iterating over `a`, we assume `b` is a typo and should be `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < len(a)`. Therefore, `i` must be set to 1 at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the initial state of `a`**: The problem states that `a` is a list with more than one element. This means `len(a)` must be at least 2.

4. **Initial state of `ad`**: Since `ad` is populated with differences between consecutive elements of `a`, and the loop runs until `i = len(a) - 1`, `ad` will have `len(a) - 1` elements. However, the initial state of `ad` is not specified, so we don't need to adjust it directly for the loop to execute. We only need to ensure that the conditions for the loop to run are met.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `a`.

State: **`a` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 1**
