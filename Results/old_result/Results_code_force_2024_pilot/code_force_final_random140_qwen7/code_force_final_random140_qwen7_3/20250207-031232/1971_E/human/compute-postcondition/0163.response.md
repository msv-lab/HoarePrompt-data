Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a list, `b` is a list, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the first element to the last element, `bd` is a list with one additional element which is `b[1] - b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` translates to `b[1] - b[0]`. Since `i` is 1, no changes are made to `i`, `a`, or `b`. The list `ad` remains unchanged as well. The only new information is that `bd` now contains an additional element, which is the difference between the first two elements of `b`.
