Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for l in range(q)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`
   - `i` is 1
   - `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`
   - `l` is `q`
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `l < q`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `l` is currently equal to `q`, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to `q + 1`.
   - The variable `q` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the other variables**: The other variables (`m`, `i`, `ql`, `s`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition. They remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`m` is `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q + 1`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`**
