Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`. The current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`. We continue the loop or iteration we were inside.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
