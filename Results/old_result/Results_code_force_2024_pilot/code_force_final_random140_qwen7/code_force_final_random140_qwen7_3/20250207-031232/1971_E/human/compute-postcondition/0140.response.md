Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is `ql + 1`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, we continue to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of `m`, `i`, `ql`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement itself does not affect these variables but indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
