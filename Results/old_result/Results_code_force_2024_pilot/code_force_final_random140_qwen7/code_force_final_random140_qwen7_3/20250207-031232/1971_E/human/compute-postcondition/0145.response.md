Output State: **`m` is `m + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `ql + 1`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `m` now includes the new addition based on the values of `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.
