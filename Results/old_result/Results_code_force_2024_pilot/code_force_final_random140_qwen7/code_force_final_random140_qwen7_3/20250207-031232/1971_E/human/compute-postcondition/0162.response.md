Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters, which involve `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `len(a)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `len(b)`. This means `i` should take values from `1` to `len(b)` inclusively.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must start from `1` and go up to `len(b)`. Since `i` is initially set to `len(a)`, we need to ensure that `i` can transition from `len(a)` to `1` and then proceed through the range `1` to `len(b)`.

5. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be able to start from `1` (the lower bound of the range) and incrementally increase to `len(b)`. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to `1` at the beginning of the loop.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `ad`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a list, `b` is a list, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the first element to the last element**
