Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ad` will contain the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the list `a`, starting from the second element up to the last element of `a`. The length of `ad` will be `len(a) - 1`. The lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` will retain their original values except for the updates made within the loop, and `i` will be equal to `len(a)` after the loop completes.

In more detail, after the loop executes all iterations, `ad` will be a list where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for every `i` from 1 to the length of `a` minus one. The variables `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` will remain unchanged except for the modifications inside the loop, and the variable `i` will be set to the value of `len(a)`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2; `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3; `bd` is a list with two elements where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]` and the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4; `bd` is a list with the element `b[4] - b[3]` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
