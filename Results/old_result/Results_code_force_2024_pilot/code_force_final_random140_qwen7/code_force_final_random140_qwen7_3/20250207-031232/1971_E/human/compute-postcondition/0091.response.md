Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list with more than one element.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(b)):`.
   - This means the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The length of `b` remains unchanged.
   - The list `bd` will have an additional element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`. At `i = 2`, this element will be `b[2] - b[1]`.

6. **New State:**
   - `a` remains a list with more than one element.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `bd` will have an additional element `b[2] - b[1]`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`a` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 2, `bd` is a list with an additional element which is `b[2] - b[1]`**.
