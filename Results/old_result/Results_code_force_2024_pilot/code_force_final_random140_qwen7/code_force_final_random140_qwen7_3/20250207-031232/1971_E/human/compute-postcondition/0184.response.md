Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`.**

The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` assigns the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in the list `a` to the variable `s`. If `ql` is not in `a`, `s` is the insertion point where `ql` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
