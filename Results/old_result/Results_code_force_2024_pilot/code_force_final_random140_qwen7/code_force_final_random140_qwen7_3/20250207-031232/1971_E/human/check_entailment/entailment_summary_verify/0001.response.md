### Reasoning

The original assessment identified a potential issue with the program not handling the case where the query point `ql` exactly matches one of the known points in `a`. However, upon closer inspection, the program does handle this case correctly. Here's why:

1. **Handling Exact Matches:**
   - When the program calls `bisect_left(a, ql)`, it finds the smallest index `s` such that `a[s] >= ql`.
   - If `a[s] == ql`, the program directly prints the corresponding time `b[s]`. This means that if the query point exactly matches one of the known points, the program correctly outputs the time for that point.

2. **Remaining Distance Calculation:**
   - If `a[s] != ql`, the program calculates the remaining distance `ql - a[s-1]` and updates the total time `m` accordingly.
   - The formula `m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` correctly computes the additional time needed to travel the remaining distance at the speed `v[s]`.

3. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic of the program is sound. It correctly identifies the segment containing the query point and calculates the time accurately.
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the correct segment.

Given these points, the original assessment was slightly off. The program does handle the edge case correctly, and the logic is indeed correct.
