### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed between each pair of points `(a[i-1], a[i])` and `(b[i-1], b[i])`.
2. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program determines the segment `[a[s-1], a[s]]` that `d` falls into and calculates the time taken to travel from `a[s-1]` to `d` using the speed calculated between `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`.
3. **Binary Search**: The program uses `bisect_left` to find the appropriate segment for `d`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The speeds are calculated as `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`.
   - This ensures that the speed is consistent within each segment `[a[i-1], a[i]]`.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies the segment `[a[s-1], a[s]]` that `d` falls into.
   - It then calculates the time taken to travel from `a[s-1]` to `d` using the speed `bd[s]`.
   - The formula used is `m += b[s-1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, which accounts for the time already spent (`b[s-1]`) and the additional time required to travel from `a[s-1]` to `d`.

3. **Handling Midpoints**:
   - The program handles midpoints correctly because it uses integer division (`//`) which rounds down the result. This ensures that the time is always rounded down to the nearest integer.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `d` is exactly equal to `a[s]` by directly printing `b[s]`.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `d` is less than `a[s]` by reducing `ql` by `a[s-1]` and recalculating the time.
