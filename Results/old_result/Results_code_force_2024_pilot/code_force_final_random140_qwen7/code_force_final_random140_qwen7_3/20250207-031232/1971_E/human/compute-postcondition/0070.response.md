Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `q` is unchanged, `m` is `m + (bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`**.

This means that the value of `m` is updated to its original value plus the result of `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, and the value of `ql` is updated to its original value minus `a[s - 1]`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `q` remain unchanged.
