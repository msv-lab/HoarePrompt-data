Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a)` (exclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `len(a)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `3`.
   - `a` is a list with more than one element.
   - `bd` is a list containing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, totaling `len(a) - 1` elements.
   - `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3]]`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `4`.

5. **Check the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Given `i` is currently `3`, if `len(a)` is greater than `3`, the loop will continue to the next iteration with `i` as `4`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `4`.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `bd` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `v` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `a` is a list with more than one element, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, totaling `len(a) - 1` elements, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3]]`**.
