Output State: **`i` is 3; `ad` is a list containing the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`**

Explanation: The initial state has `i` as 3 and `ad` as a list containing `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1]]`. The code snippet appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`. Therefore, `ad` now contains `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
