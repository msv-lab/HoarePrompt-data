Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `ad` is a list containing only one element which is 0**.

The code initializes the list `ad` with a single element `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
