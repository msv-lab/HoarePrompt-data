Output State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, and `a` and `i` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `ad` gains a new element, which is the calculated difference.
