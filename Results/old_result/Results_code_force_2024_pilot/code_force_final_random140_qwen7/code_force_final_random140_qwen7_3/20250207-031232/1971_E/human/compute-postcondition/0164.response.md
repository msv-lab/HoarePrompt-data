Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is a list
   - `b` is a list
   - `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the first element to the last element
   - `bd` is a list with one additional element which is `b[1] - b[0]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no modifications are mentioned in the loop body, these lists stay the same.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `a` is a list (unchanged)
   - `b` is a list (unchanged)
   - `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the first element to the last element (unchanged)
   - `bd` is a list with one additional element which is `b[1] - b[0]` (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a list, `b` is a list, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the first element to the last element, `bd` is a list with one additional element which is `b[1] - b[0]`**
