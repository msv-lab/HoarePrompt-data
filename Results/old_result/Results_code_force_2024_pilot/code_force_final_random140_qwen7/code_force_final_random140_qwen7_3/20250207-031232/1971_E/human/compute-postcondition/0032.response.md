Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for l in range(q)`. The variables involved here are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `l` is not explicitly initialized in the given state; it is the loop variable that will take values from `range(q)`.
   - `q` is not mentioned in the given state but is used as the upper bound for the `range` function.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than `q`. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `q` is at least 1 (since `range(q)` includes values from 0 to `q-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` is the loop variable, its value will change during each iteration, starting from 0 up to `q-1`.
   - We need to ensure that `q` is at least 1 so that the loop can execute at least once.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `q` to ensure the loop can execute. The initial value of `l` is not relevant since it will be set by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `q` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`v` contains the values `[ad[1]/bd[1], ad[2]/bd[2], ad[3]/bd[3], ..., ad[len(a)-1]/bd[len(a)-1]]`, `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged, and `i` is `len(a)`, `q` must be greater than 0**
