Output State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `a` retains its original values, and `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. The initial state of `ad` contains an element `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, and now it gets updated to include `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.
