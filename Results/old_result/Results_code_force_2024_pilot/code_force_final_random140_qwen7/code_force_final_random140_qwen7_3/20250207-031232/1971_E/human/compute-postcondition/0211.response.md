Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` and `bd` are unchanged, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in list `a` or the insertion point where `ql` would maintain the sorted order of `a`, `l` is `q - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `ql = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `ql`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `q`, `ad`, `bd`, `s`, and `l`) remain unchanged. The new value of `ql` is an integer obtained from the input.
