Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. The if condition is satisfied, meaning either `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.**
