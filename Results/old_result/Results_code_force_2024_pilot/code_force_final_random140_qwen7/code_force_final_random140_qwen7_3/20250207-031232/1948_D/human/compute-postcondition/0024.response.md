Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined as:
   ```python
   for k in range(0, n - j):
   ```
   The variables in the loop head are `k`, `n`, and `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than `n - j`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\).
   - `count` is 2 if either the (k+1)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+1+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+1)-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+1+j)-th character of `s`; otherwise, `count` is 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was some value `k_prev`.
   - For the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will be `k_prev + 1`.
   - The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `t` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `s` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `count` will be recalculated based on the new value of `k` (which is `k_prev + 1`).

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 2 if either the (k+2)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+2+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+2)-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+2+j)-th character of `s`; otherwise, `count` is 1.**
