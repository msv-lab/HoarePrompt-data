Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000, `count` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1.**

The variable `count` is initialized to 0, but no other changes are made to the values of `t`, `s`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
