Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the replacement of question marks (`?`) to form the longest possible tandem repeat. Instead, it checks for existing tandem repeats without attempting to replace question marks to potentially form longer ones.

For example, consider the input `"code?????s"`. The program will output `10`, but the correct output should be `12` because we can replace the question marks to form `"codexxxxxxs"`, which has a tandem repeat substring of length `12` ("xxxxxx").

Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:
1. Replace all question marks with each possible lowercase letter.
2. For each replacement, check for the longest tandem repeat substring.

This would involve nested loops to try all combinations of replacements and then checking for the longest tandem repeat for each combination. However, given the constraints, a more efficient approach might be needed to handle all cases correctly.
