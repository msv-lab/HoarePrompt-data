Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - From the problem statement, we know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - For each test case, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\).
   - The total length of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 5000.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `n // 2` to `0` (exclusive) in steps of `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be greater than `0`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `n` is the variable that controls the loop, we need to ensure that `n // 2 > 0`.
   - This implies that `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000, and `n` must be greater than 1.**
