Output State: **`count` is 2, `k` is 1, `n` is greater than `j`, the character at index `k` in string `s` is not '?', the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not '?', and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged according to the initial state.
