Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of all strings s over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 3 if for any `k` in the range \(0\) to \(n-j-1\), the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` hold true for three consecutive iterations; otherwise, `count` is less than 3 and the program returns 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, and the loop has completed all its iterations without `count` ever reaching `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final value of `count` is either equal to `n - j` (if the condition `count == j` was met at least once during the loop's execution) or 0 (if the condition `count == j` was never met). The variable `k` will be equal to `n - j - 1`, as it increments with each iteration of the loop. The variable `n` remains greater than `j`, and the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` in string `s` continue to meet the specified conditions throughout the loop's execution. If `count` equals `j` at any point, the function prints `count * 2` and returns, thus terminating the loop prematurely.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
