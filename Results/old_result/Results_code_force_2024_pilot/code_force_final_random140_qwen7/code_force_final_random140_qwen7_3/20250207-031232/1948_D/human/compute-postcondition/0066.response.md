Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n // 2` down to 1 (exclusive). This means `j` starts at `n // 2 - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\)
   - `count` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`
   - The loop has completed all its iterations without `count` ever reaching `j`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop has already completed all its iterations without `count` ever reaching `j`, the value of `j` will decrease by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `n // 2 - 2` (assuming `n` remains the same).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `count` remains 0 as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` decreases by 1, so `j` becomes `n // 2 - 2`.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`**.
