Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\), and `count` is 3 if either the (k+2)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+2+j)-th character of `s` is a question mark, or the (k+2)-th character of `s` is equal to the (k+2+j)-th character of `s`; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and the program returns 0.
