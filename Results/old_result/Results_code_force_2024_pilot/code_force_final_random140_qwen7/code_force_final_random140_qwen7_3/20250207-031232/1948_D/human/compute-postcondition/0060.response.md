Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000, `count` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `k` is `j + 1` if `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is a question mark. Otherwise, `count` is 0.**
