You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    func_1()

def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    return 0



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` and an integer `t` (though `t` is not used in the function), checking for pairs of characters in `s` that are either equal or both question marks. If it finds a sequence where `count` (the number of matching pairs found consecutively) equals the current value of `j` (which decreases from `n//2` to 1), it prints `count * 2` and returns. If no such sequence is found after checking all possible pairs, the function returns 0. The function can return None in cases where the return statement is not explicitly included.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the replacement of question marks (`?`) to form the longest possible tandem repeat. Instead, it checks for existing tandem repeats without attempting to replace question marks to potentially form longer ones.

For example, consider the input `"code?????s"`. The program will output `10`, but the correct output should be `12` because we can replace the question marks to form `"codexxxxxxs"`, which has a tandem repeat substring of length `12` ("xxxxxx").

Here’s a corrected approach:
1. Replace all question marks with each possible lowercase letter.
2. For each replacement, check for the longest tandem repeat substring.

This would involve nested loops to try all combinations of replacements and then checking for the longest tandem repeat for each combination. However, given the constraints, a more efficient approach might be needed to handle all cases correctly.
