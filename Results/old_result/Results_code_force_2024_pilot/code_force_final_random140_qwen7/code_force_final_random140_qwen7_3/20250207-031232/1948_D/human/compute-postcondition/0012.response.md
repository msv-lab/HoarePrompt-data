Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 5000\).
- `count` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `j` is 0.
- The current value of `count` is equal to `j`.

The print statement is `print(count * 2)`. Given that `count` is currently equal to `j`, and `j` is 0, the expression `count * 2` evaluates to `0 * 2`, which is `0`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **0**
