Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is either 3 or 0.
- `k` is 2.
- `n` is greater than `j`.
- The character at index `k` in string `s` is not '?'.
- The character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not '?'.
- The character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`.

The print statement is `print(count * 2)`. 

Given that `count` is either 3 or 0, let's consider both cases:

1. If `count` is 3:
   \[
   count * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6
   \]
2. If `count` is 0:
   \[
   count * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0
   \]

Since the problem does not specify which value `count` takes, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the problem asks for the exact output, so we must choose one of these values. Given no additional constraints, we can infer that the problem intends for us to consider the most straightforward or common case, which is often the non-zero value unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, we assume `count` is 3.

Output: **6**
