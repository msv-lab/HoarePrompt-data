Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `count = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `count`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated states are as mentioned above.
