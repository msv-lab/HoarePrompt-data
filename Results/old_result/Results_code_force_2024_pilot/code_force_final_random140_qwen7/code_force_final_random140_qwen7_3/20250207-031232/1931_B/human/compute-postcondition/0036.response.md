Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in list `a` and `target`, `possible` is `False`, and `t` is `t - 1`; `a` is a list of integers created from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
