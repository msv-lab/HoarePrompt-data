Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[1] - target`, `possible` is False, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The line `possible = False` sets the variable `possible` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `current_balance`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
