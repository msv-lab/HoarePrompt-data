Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t)` statement. This means the loop variable is an underscore `_` and it iterates `t` times.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `t` and `_`. However, since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, the only relevant variable here is `t`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in list `a` and `target`, and `possible` is `False`. These variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop has just completed an iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1. Therefore, `t` should be `t - 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in list `a` and `target`, `possible` is `False`, and `t` is `t - 1`**.
