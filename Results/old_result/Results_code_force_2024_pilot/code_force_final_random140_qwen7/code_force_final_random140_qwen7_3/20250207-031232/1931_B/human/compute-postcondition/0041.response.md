Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - We know from the given state that `i` is `n-1`.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly stated, but it is used in the range function.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(n)` to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0, the range would be empty).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n-1`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` (`n-1`) is already correct if `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` is `True`, `t` is `t - 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`**
