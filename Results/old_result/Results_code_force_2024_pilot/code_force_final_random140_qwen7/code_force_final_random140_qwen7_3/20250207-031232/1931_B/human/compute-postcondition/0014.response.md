Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
