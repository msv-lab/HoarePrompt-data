Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly solve the given problem. The logic in the `func_1()` function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not the correct approach to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the average amount of water per container is an integer. This is because, through the allowed operations, we can only redistribute the water without changing the total amount. Therefore, if the total amount of water divided by the number of containers is an integer, it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Hereâ€™s how the corrected program should look:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_water = sum(arr)
        avg_water = total_water / n
        
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

Explanation:
1. We read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, we read the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `arr`.
3. We calculate the total amount of water and the average amount of water per container.
4. We check if the total amount of water is divisible by `n` (i.e., `total_water % n == 0`).
5. If it is divisible, we print 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. Otherwise, we print 'NO'.

Given this analysis, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
