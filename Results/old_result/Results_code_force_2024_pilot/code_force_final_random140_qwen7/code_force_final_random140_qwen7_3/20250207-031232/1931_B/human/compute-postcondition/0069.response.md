Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + ... + a[n-2] - target`, `possible` is `True` if the condition `possible` is met, otherwise `False`, `t` is `t - n + 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
