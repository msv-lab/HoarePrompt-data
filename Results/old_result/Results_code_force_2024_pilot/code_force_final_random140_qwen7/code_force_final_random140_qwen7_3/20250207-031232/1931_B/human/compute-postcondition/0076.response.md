Output State: **`i` is 0; `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`**

Explanation: The code updates `current_balance` by adding the value of `a[i] - target` to it. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, it remains unchanged. Therefore, `current_balance` is updated to `a[0] - target`.
