Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`
- `possible` is `False`
- The loop breaks out if `current_balance` becomes less than 0 at any point during the iterations

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` and does not depend on the values of `i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, or any other variables, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **NO**
