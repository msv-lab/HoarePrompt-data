Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. After executing `n = int(input())`, `n` is now an integer input from the user, while `t` and `arr` remain unchanged.**

This means that `t` retains its original condition of being greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\). The variable `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user, and `arr` remains as the sorted list of integers derived from the input string.
