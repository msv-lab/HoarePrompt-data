Output State: **`i` is -1, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` is `True`, `t` is `t - n + 1`, `target` is now `total_water // n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a**.

Explanation: The line `possible = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment, so their states remain unchanged.
