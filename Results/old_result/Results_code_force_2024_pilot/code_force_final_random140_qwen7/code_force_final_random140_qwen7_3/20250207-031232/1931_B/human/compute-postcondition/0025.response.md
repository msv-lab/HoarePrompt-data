Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `n` is the new integer input from the user.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
