Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[1] - target`, `possible` is False, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates the `current_balance` by adding the value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) and subtracting `target`. The other variables (`possible` and `n`) remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially 1, it does not change after the operation. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
