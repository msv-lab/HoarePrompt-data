Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. Note that `arr` is not monotonically non-decreasing, meaning there exists at least one index \(i\) where \(arr[i] > arr[i+1]\).

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or the contents of `arr`.

Output: **'NO'**
