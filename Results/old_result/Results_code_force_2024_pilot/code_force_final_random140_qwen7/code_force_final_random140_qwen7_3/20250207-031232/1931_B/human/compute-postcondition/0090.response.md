Output State: **`i` is 3; `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[1] + a[3] - target`; `possible` is False**

Explanation: The code updates `current_balance` by adding `a[i] - target` to it. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing `current_balance += a[i] - target`, `i` becomes 3 (since `i` is incremented implicitly by the way the code is structured). The value of `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[3] - target`. The value of `possible` remains unchanged as it was set to `False` and no operation altered it.
