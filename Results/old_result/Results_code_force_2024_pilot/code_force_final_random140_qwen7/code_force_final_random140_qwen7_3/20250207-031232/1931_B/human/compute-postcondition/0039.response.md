Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`**.

Explanation: The line `current_balance = 0` sets the value of `current_balance` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
