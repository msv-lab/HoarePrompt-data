### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), it is always possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal. This is because we can distribute the total water evenly among all containers.

3. **Analysis of the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container.
   - It sorts the array `arr` of water amounts.
   - It checks if the sorted array is non-decreasing (i.e., `arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]` for all `i`).
   - If the array is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Flaw in the Code**:
   - The condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)))` checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, but this is not necessary for the solution.
   - The key point is that since the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, we can always redistribute the water to make each container have the same amount of water, regardless of the initial order of the amounts.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water per container, which is the total amount of water divided by `n`.
   - Check if all containers can be made to have this target amount by pouring water as needed.

### Conclusion:
The provided code incorrectly checks if the array is sorted, which is not required. The correct approach should directly check if the total water can be evenly distributed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary and incorrect condition to determine the possibility of making all containers have the same amount of water.
