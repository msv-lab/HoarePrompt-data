Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. If the list `arr` is sorted, the program continues without any changes to `t`, `n`, or `arr`. If the list `arr` is not sorted, the program continues without any changes to `t`, `n`, or `arr` as well.**
