Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. If the list `arr` is sorted (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next), no changes are made. Otherwise, the conditions on `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain the same as the precondition.
