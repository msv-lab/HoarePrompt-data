State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because the `range()` function in Python generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the specified number.
3. Additionally, `t` is constrained by the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
4. The initial state of `t` being an input integer within this range ensures that the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
