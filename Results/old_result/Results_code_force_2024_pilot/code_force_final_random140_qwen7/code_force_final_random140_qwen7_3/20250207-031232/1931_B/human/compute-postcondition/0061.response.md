Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + ... + a[n-2] - target`, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - n + 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will decrement from `n-1` to `-1` because it starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. The `current_balance` accumulates the difference between each element in the list `a` from index `0` to `n-2` and the `target` value. Since the loop breaks when `current_balance` becomes negative, `possible` remains `False`. The variable `t` decreases by 1 for each iteration, so after `n` iterations, it will be `t - n + 1` (since it was already decremented once before the loop started). The `target` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
