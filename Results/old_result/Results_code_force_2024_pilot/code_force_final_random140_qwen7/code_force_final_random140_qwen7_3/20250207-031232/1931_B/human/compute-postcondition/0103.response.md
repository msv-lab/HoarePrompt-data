Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, `i` will be `-1`, `current_balance` will be the overall balance calculated as the sum of differences between each element in list `a` and `target` for all `n` values processed, and `possible` will be `True` if the balance never goes below 0 during any of the iterations; otherwise, it will remain `False`. The variable `target` will be updated based on the `total_water` which is the sum of all elements in list `a` divided by `n` for each test case, and `total_water` itself will be recalculated for each new value of `n`.
