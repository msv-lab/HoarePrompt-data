Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in list `a` and `target`, `possible` is `False`, and `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
