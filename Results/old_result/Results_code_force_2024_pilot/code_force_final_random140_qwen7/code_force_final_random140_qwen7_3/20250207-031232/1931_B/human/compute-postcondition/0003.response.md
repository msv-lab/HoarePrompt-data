Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input string using `input().split()` and converting each resulting string element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
