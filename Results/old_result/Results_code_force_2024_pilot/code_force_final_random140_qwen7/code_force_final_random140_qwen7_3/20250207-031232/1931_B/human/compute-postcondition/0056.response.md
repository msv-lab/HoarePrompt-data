Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `current_balance` is `a[i] - target`, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 2`, `target` is `total_water // n`**

Explanation: The code updates `current_balance` by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `target`. Given that `i` was initially `n-1`, after executing `current_balance += a[i] - target`, `i` becomes `n-2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
