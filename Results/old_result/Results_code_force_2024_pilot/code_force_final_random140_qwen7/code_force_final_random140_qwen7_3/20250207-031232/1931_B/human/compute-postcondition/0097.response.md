Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`
- `possible` is True
- The loop breaks out if `current_balance` becomes less than 0 at any point during the iterations

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print('YES')` is executed.

Given that the loop breaks out if `current_balance` becomes less than 0, and `current_balance` is initialized as the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, we need to consider the value of `current_balance` after all iterations.

Since the loop only breaks if `current_balance` becomes less than 0, it implies that `current_balance` remains non-negative throughout the iterations. Therefore, the condition for printing `'YES'` must hold true.

Output: **YES**
