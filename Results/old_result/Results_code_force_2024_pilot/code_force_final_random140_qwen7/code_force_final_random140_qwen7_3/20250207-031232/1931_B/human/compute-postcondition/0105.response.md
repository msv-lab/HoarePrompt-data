Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it calculates the target value as the average of the list elements and checks if the cumulative difference between each element and the target remains non-negative throughout the list. If the cumulative difference never falls below zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
