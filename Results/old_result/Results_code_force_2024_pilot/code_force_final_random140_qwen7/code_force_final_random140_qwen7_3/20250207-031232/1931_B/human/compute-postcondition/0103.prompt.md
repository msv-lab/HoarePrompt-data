Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    current_balance = 0
    possible = True
    for i in range(n):
        current_balance += a[i] - target
        if current_balance < 0:
            possible = False
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the if-else block executes, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in list `a` and `target` (i.e., `sum(a) - n*target`), and `possible` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `-1`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + ... + a[n-2] - target`, `possible` is `True` if the condition `possible` is met, otherwise `False`, `t` is `t - n + 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `possible` is True if the balance never goes below 0 during the iterations; otherwise, `possible` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
