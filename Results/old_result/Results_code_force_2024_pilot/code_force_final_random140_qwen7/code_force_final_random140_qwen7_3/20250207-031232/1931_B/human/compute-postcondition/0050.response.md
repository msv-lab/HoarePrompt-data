Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `current_balance` is `current_balance + (a[n-1] - target)`, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`**

Explanation: The code updates the `current_balance` by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `target`. Given that `i` is initially `n-1`, after executing the line `current_balance += a[i] - target`, `i` becomes `n-2` because the index is decremented after the operation in typical list traversal scenarios. The `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `(a[n-1] - target)`. All other variables (`possible`, `t`, and `target`) remain unchanged.
