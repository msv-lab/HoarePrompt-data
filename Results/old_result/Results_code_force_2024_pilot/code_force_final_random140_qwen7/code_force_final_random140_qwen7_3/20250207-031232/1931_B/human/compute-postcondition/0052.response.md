Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `current_balance` is `current_balance + (a[n-1] - target)`, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, and `target`. These variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
