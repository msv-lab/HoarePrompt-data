Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the new integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, and `arr` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. Additionally, the new value of `n` is the integer input from the user.
