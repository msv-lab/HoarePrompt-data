Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + ... + a[n-2] - target`, `possible` is `True` if the condition `possible` is met, otherwise `False`, `t` is `t - n + 1`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, `target`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
