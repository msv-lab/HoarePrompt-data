Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `current_balance` is `current_balance + (a[n-1] - target)`
   - `possible` is `False`
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `target` is `total_water // n`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n-2` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` will be `n-1`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `current_balance` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is `n-1`), but since the exact update logic is omitted, we cannot specify the exact value of `current_balance` without the loop body.
   - `possible` remains `False` unless the loop body changes it.
   - `t` will be decremented by 1 again.
   - `target` remains `total_water // n` unless the loop body changes it.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_balance` is unspecified, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `t - 2`, `target` is `total_water // n`**
