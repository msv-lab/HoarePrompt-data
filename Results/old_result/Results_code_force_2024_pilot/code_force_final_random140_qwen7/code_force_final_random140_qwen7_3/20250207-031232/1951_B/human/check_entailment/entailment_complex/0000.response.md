Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of ratings `a`.
3. The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
4. Inside `func_1()`, the program calculates the number of wins `wins` without any swaps by iterating through the list `a` until it finds an element greater than `a[k-1]`.
5. If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `wins - 1`.
6. Otherwise, it calculates `wins_with_swap`, which represents the number of wins if a swap is made to move the `k-1`th element to a better position.
7. The program then prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`.

The logic in the program seems to be flawed in the following ways:
- The state after the first loop should not have `wins` being 3, `i` being 9, and `n` being \(10^5\). Instead, `wins` should be the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
- The second loop in the program is incorrectly implemented. It should start from `wins_with_swap` and check if the elements are greater than `a[k-1]` to determine the maximum number of wins with a swap.
- The final output calculation is also incorrect. It should be comparing the maximum number of wins without a swap and with a swap correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
