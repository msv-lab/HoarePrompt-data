Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `wins_with_swap`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 9, and `wins_with_swap` is 5. Also, `k` must be greater than 10.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 10.
   - The value of `wins_with_swap` remains unchanged at 5.
   - The value of `k` must still be greater than 10.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`wins` is 3, `wins_with_swap` is 5, `i` is 10, `k` must be greater than 10**
