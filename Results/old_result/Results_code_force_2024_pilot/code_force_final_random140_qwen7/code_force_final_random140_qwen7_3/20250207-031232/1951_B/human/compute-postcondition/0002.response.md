Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `wins` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `wins` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
