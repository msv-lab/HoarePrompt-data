Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only effect is that we break out of the implied loop or conditional.
