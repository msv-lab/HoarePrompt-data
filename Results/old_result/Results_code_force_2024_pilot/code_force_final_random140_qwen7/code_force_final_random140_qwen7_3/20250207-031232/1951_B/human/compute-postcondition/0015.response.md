Output State: **`wins` is 2, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `wins` and `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of `wins` and `i` remain unchanged.
