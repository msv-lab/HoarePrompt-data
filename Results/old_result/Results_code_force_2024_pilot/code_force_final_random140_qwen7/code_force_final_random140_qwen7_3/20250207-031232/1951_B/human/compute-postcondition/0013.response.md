Output State: **`wins` is 2, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `wins` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially increased by 1 (as per the initial postcondition), it now becomes 2. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement, as mentioned in the initial postcondition.
