You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins += 1
    if wins >= k:
        print(wins - 1)
    wins_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins_with_swap += 1
    print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` and two indices `k` and `n` to determine the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the `k-1`th element. It calculates two values: `wins`, which counts the number of elements less than or equal to `a[k-1]` without considering a potential swap, and `wins_with_swap`, which considers a hypothetical swap. The function then prints the maximum of two values: `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of wins for cow \( k \). Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where swapping cow \( k \) with another cow can potentially allow it to win more matches.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Initial Logic**: The program starts by counting the number of cows with ratings less than cow \( k \)'s rating. This is done using the loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
           break
       wins += 1
   ```
   This logic correctly counts the number of cows that cow \( k \) would defeat if no swaps were made.

2. **Wins with Swap**: The program then attempts to calculate the number of wins if cow \( k \) is swapped with another cow. However, the logic here is flawed:
   ```python
   wins_with_swap = wins + 1
   for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
       if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
           break
       wins_with_swap += 1
   ```
   - The variable `wins_with_swap` is incorrectly initialized to `wins + 1`. This means it assumes cow \( k \) will win the first match after the swap, which is not necessarily true.
   - The loop then increments `wins_with_swap` for each subsequent cow with a lower rating than cow \( k \), but this does not account for the fact that cow \( k \) might not win the first match after the swap.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 3
  12 10 14 11 8 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates that cow 3 can win 2 matches after a swap, which is not possible because cow 3 cannot win the first match if it is swapped with cow 2.

A correct implementation should properly handle the swap logic and ensure that the number of wins is calculated accurately.
