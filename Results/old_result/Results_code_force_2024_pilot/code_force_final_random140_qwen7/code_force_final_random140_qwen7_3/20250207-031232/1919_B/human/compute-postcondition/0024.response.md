Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of the string `e`.
- `s` remains the same input integer.
- `e` is now an empty string.
- `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the original string `e`.
- `M` is the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

Since `e` is now an empty string, both `P` (the total number of '+' characters in the original string `e`) and `M` (the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+') are zero.

Therefore, the expression `abs(P - M)` evaluates to `abs(0 - 0)`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
