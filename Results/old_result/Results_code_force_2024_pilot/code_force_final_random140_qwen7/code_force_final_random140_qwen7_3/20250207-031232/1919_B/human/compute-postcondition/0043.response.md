Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` is an input integer, `P` is 3, `M` is 1**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is equal to the length of the string `e`.
- `s` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
- `P` is 2 if the next character `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 1.
- `M` is 2 if the next character `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 1.
- The code `P += 1` increments the value of `P` by 1. Since `P` was initially either 1 or 2, after the increment, `P` becomes 3 (if it was 2) or 2 (if it was 1). However, since the problem does not specify the value of `q`, we assume `P` is now 3.
- The values of `i`, `s`, and `M` remain unchanged.
