Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty after splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
2. The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.
3. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the count of '+' and '-' in the string `s` and prints the absolute value of this difference.
4. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. For example, in the third test case (`--+++++++-`), the provided solution would incorrectly output 8 instead of 0, because it only counts the differences without considering the optimal grouping.
5. The solution fails to handle the actual array splitting and calculating the penalties for different splits.

Correctness: **False**
