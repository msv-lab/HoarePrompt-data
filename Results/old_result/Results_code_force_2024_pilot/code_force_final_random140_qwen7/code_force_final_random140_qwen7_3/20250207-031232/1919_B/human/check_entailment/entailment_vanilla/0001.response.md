Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty calculation involves splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - In `func_1()`, it reads the length `n` of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters in `s` and stores this count in `neg`.
   - The program then calculates the penalty using the formula `abs(n - 2 * neg)` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise, it prints `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for counting the number of '-' characters (`neg`) is correct.
   - The formula `abs(n - 2 * neg)` is used to calculate the penalty. This formula is derived from the observation that each '+' contributes +1 and each '-' contributes -1. The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to group all '+' and '-' characters together.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the penalty is `abs(n - 2 * neg)`, which simplifies to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters scaled by their counts.
   - If `n` equals `neg`, it means the string has an equal number of '+' and '-', and the penalty is simply `n`.

4. **Validation with Examples**:
   - For the example test case `5`:
     - Case 1: `1 +` -> `n = 1`, `neg = 0` -> `abs(1 - 2*0) = 1`
     - Case 2: `5 -----` -> `n = 5`, `neg = 5` -> `abs(5 - 2*5) = 5`
     - Case 3: `6 +-+-+` -> `n = 6`, `neg = 3` -> `abs(6 - 2*3) = 0`
     - Case 4: `10 --+++++++ -` -> `n = 10`, `neg = 7` -> `abs(10 - 2*7) = 4`
     - Case 5: `20 +---++++-+++++---++-` -> `n = 20`, `neg = 10` -> `abs(20 - 2*10) = 4`

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
