Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-', with no other characters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(abs(P - M))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` remains the same input integer, `e` is now an empty string, `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, and `M` is the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` is an input integer, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `P` will be equal to the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` will be equal to the total number of '-' (or any other character that is not '+') characters in the string `e`.

This means that for every character `q` in the string `e`, if `q` is '+', `P` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `M` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
