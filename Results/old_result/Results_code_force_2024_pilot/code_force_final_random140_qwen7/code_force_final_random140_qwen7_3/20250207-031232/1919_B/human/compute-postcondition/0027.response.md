Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` is assigned the value of int(input()), `e` is updated to the new input string, `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the new string `e`, and `M` is the total number of characters in the new string `e` that are not '+'.**

Explanation: The code `e = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `e`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to the length of the original string `e`, which is no longer relevant since `e` has been updated. The variable `s` is reassigned to the integer value of the input provided by the user. The counts `P` and `M` are recalculated based on the new string `e`.
