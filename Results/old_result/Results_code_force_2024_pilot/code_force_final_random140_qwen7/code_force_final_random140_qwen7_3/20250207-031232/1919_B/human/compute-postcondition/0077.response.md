Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `s` and a string `e` containing characters '+' and '-'. For each test case, it counts the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `e`. After processing all test cases, it prints the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters for each string `e`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
