Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `q in e`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the string `e`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to the length of the string `e`.
   - `s` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
   - `P` is 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 1.
   - `M` is 2 if `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 1.

3. **Understand what happens in the loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`.
   - For each iteration, `q` takes the value of the next character in `e`.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is the length of the string `e`.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is the result of an input operation.
   - `P` and `M` are updated based on the current value of `q`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the length of the string `e`, it does not change.
   - `s` remains the same as it is determined by the input and does not change within the loop.
   - `P` and `M` will be updated based on the next character `q` in the string `e`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` remains the same: `i` is equal to the length of the string `e`.
   - `s` remains the same: `s` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
   - `P` and `M` will be updated based on the next character `q` in the string `e`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `P` is 2 if the next character `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 1, `M` is 2 if the next character `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 1.**
