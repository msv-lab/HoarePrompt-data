You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-', with no other characters.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        
        e = input()
        
        P = 0
        
        M = 0
        
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        
        print(abs(P - M))
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` will remain the same input integer, `e` will be an empty string, `P` will be the total number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, and `M` will be the total number of '-' (or any other character that is not '+') characters in the original string `e`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case defined by three values: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 1 and 5000), and s (a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'). It returns the count of '+' characters in the string s.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
