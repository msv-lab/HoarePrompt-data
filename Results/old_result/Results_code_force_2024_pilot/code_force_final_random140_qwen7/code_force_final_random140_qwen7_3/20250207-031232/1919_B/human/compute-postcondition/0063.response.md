Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is not '+', `M` is `M + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `M` is incremented by 1. Since the initial condition was that if `q` is the next character in `e` and it is '+', then `P` is 1, and if `q` is not '+', then `M` is 1, and given that `q` is not '+', `M` starts as 1. After executing `M += 1`, `M` becomes 2. Therefore, `M` is now `M + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
