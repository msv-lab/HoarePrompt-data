Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` is an input integer, `P` is 2 if the next character `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 1, `M` is 3 if the next character `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `s` also remains unchanged as it was assigned the value of `int(input())` but was not modified by the code. The value of `P` and `M` depend on the next character `q`, but since no new information about `q` is provided, their values remain as they were initially defined based on `q`.
