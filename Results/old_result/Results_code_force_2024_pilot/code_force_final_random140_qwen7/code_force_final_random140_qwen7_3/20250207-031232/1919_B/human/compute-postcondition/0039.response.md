Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the string `e`, `s` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `P` is 1 if `q` is '+' otherwise `P` is 0, `M` is 1 if `q` is not '+' otherwise `M` is 0, and `M` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `M` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`i`, `s`, `P`, `M`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
