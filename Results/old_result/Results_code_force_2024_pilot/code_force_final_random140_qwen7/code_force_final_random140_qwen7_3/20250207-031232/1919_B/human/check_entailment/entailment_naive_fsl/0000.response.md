Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle the string input as an array of characters representing +1 and -1 values. Instead, it treats the string as a sequence of digits and counts the number of '+' and '-' characters separately. This approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
+-+-+-
```
The expected output is `4`, but the program will output `0` because it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters without considering the optimal splitting strategy.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to find the optimal way to split the array into segments such that the total penalty is minimized. This involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the best splits.
