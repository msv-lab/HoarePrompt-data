Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `M` is increased by 1.**

The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Since `e` is a non-empty string and `q` is the next character in the string `e`, these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `M` is increased by 1.
