Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is set to `x`.
- `x` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `ans` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met for `i` from 1 to `x`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which represents the number of times the specified condition was true during the loop iterations.

To summarize:
- `i` is set to `x` after the loop completes.
- `x` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `ans` is the count of how many times `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was true for `i` ranging from 1 to `x`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the condition arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2 was met for i from 1 to x)**
