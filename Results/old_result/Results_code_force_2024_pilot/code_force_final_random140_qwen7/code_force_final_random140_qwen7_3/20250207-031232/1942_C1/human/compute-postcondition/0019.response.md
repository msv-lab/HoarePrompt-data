Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer entered by the user, and `ans` is 1. If the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` retains its original value (which is undefined in this context since there's no specified initial value other than the if part).
