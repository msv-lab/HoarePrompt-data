Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `x` is the second integer entered by the user; `y` is the third integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state where it is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1.
