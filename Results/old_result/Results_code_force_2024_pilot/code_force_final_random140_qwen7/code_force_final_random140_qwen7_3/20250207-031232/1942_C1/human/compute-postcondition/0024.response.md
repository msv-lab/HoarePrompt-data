Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `x`, `x` is the second integer entered by the user, and `ans` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met for `i` from 1 to `x`.**

In more detail, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `x` after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `x` remains unchanged as it is the second integer entered by the user. The variable `ans` will hold the count of how many times the difference between consecutive elements in the list `arr` is exactly 2, starting from index 1 up to index `x-1`.
