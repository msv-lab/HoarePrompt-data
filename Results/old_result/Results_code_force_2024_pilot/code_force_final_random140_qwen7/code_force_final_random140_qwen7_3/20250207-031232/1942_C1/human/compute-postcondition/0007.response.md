Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `x` is the second integer entered by the user; `y` is the third integer entered by the user; `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings, sorting this list changes its order but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and `arr` is now a sorted version of its original content.
