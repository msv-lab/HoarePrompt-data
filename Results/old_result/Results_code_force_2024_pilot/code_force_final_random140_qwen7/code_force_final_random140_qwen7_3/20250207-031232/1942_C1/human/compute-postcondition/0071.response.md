Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the current value of `x` plus 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially set to the current value of `x`, now `ans` is the current value of `x` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
