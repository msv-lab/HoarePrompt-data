Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, it processes integers n, x, and y (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0). The vertices are represented as x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters t, n, x, and y. It processes these parameters according to the given constraints and returns a result for each test case.
