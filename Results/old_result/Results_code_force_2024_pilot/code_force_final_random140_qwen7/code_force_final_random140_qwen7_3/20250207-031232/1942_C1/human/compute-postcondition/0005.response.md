Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `x` is the second integer entered by the user; `y` is the third integer entered by the user; `arr` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` takes the input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
