Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. Given the constraints, `y` is always 0.
3. It then reads the chosen vertices and stores them in the list `arr`.
4. The list `arr` is sorted and a dummy vertex `n + arr[0]` is appended to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
5. The variable `ans` is initialized to `x - 2` because initially, we can form at most `x - 2` triangles using `x` vertices.
6. The program then iterates through the sorted list `arr` to count how many times the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 2. Each such pair allows forming an additional triangle.
7. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be formed under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
