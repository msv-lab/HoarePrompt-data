Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0; the vertices are represented as x distinct integers from 1 to n; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the current execution is inside the if block if __name__ == '__main__'**
