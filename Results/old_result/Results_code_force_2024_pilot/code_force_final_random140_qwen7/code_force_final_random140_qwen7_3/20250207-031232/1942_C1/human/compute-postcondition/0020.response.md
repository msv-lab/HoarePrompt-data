Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `x` is the second integer entered by the user
   - `ans` is 1

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, x + 1):`
   - This means `i` will take values from 1 to `x` inclusive.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The condition `i <= x` must still hold true, meaning `x` must be at least 3.

6. **Maintaining Other States:**
   - `x` is the second integer entered by the user, so it remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is determined by the condition inside the loop. Since the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was not met (as `i` was 2), `ans` remains 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `x`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `x` is the second integer entered by the user, and `ans` is 1**
