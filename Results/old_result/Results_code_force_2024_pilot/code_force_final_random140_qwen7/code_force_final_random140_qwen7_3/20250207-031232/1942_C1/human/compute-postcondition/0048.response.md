Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the output state will be such that `i` is equal to `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, and `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is met. Therefore, `ans` will be equal to the number of times this condition is true from `i = 1` to `i = x`.

In simpler terms, `i` will be the final value of `x` after the loop completes, `x` must still be greater than 0, and `ans` will count how many consecutive elements in `arr` differ by exactly 2.
