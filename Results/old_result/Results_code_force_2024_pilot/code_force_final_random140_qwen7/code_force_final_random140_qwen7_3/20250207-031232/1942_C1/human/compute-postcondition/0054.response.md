Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings from the input split, `i` is the final value of `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions or values (other than `t` being decreased by 1).
