Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was met for `i` from 1 to `x`, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers converted from the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `i`, `ans`, `t`, or the original conversion of the input to the list `arr`. After sorting, `arr` will contain the same elements as before but in sorted order.
