The loop head contains the variable `t`. The condition for the loop to continue is `t > 0`. Given that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust it to ensure the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` will be the final value of `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, and `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
