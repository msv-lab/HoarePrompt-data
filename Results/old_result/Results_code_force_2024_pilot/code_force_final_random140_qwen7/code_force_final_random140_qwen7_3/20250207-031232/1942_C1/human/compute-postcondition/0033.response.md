Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers converted from the input with `n + arr[0]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans = x - 2` assigns the value of `x - 2` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n + arr[0]` is appended to the list `arr`, which was initially sorted. The variable `t` is decremented by 1.
