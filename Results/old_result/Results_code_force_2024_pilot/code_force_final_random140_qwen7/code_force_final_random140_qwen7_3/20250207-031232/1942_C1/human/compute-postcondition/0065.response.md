Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `x + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is the current value of `x - 1`.
   - `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0.
   - `i` is `1`.
   - The difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `2`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `1`, the loop will continue as long as `i < x + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `2`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `2`.

5. **Adjust other states**:
   - `x` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, it does not change.
   - `ans` remains `x - 1` because the loop body does not modify it.
   - `t` remains greater than 0 because the loop body does not modify it.
   - The difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` will still be `2` because the loop body does not modify the elements of `arr`.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` becomes `2`.
   - All other states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the current value of `x - 1`, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0, `i` is 2, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2.**
