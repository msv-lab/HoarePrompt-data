Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the current value of `x - 1`, `t` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was equal to `x - 2`. After executing this line, `ans` becomes `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
