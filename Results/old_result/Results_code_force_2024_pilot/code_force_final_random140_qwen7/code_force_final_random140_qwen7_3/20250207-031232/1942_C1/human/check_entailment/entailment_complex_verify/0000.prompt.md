You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

The variable `t` will be 0 since all iterations of the loop have been completed, and `arr` will be a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.
        #
        #In simpler terms, `i` will be the final value of `x`, `x` must still be greater than 0, and `ans` will hold the total count of consecutive pairs in the array `arr` that differ by exactly 2. The loop variable `t` will be 0, indicating that no more iterations are left to execute.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \). For each test case, it reads \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \), sorts them, appends \( n + \) first element to the end of the list, and counts the number of consecutive pairs in the list that differ by exactly 2. It then prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final count for each one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it fails to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out. 

The program attempts to calculate the number of triangles by checking consecutive pairs of vertices and counting them if their difference is 2. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of forming triangles using the chosen vertices and additional vertices that can be added within the constraints.

For example, consider the following test case:
- \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 0 \)
- Chosen vertices: \( [1, 6, 2, 5] \)

The program will output 2, but the correct answer should be 6. Here's how to achieve 6 triangles:
1. Connect vertices 1 and 6 to form a triangle.
2. Connect vertices 6 and 2 to form another triangle.
3. Connect vertices 2 and 5 to form another triangle.
4. Connect vertices 5 and 1 to form another triangle.
5. Connect vertices 1 and 2 to form another triangle.
6. Connect vertices 2 and 6 to form another triangle.

The program fails to recognize these additional possibilities because it only checks consecutive pairs and does not explore all valid combinations of vertices to form triangles. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
