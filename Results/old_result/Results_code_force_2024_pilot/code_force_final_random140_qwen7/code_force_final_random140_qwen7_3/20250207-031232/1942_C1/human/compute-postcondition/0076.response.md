Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers where the last element is `n + arr[0]`.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `ans` is the current value of `x + 2`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is the final value of `x`.
- The difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 2 or the loop has executed without finding such a pair.

Given this information, we need to determine the value of `ans` when the `print(ans)` statement is executed.

From the description, `ans` is defined as `x + 2`. Since `x` is greater than 0, let's assume the smallest possible value for `x` to understand the minimum value of `ans`. If `x` is 1 (the smallest positive integer), then `ans` would be `1 + 2 = 3`.

However, since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only express `ans` in terms of `x`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **x + 2 (where x is a positive integer)**
