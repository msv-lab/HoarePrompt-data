Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in l:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `ele` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `l` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `l`. Once `l` is empty, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `ele` is the variable that changes during each iteration, we don't need to specify its initial value directly. We just need to ensure that the list `l` is not empty when the loop starts.
   - The list `l` should contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the list `l` needing to have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` must have at least one element**
