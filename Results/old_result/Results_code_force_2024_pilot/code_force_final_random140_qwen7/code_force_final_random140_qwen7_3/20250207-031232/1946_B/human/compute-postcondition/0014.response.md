Postcondition: `l` is a list with at least one element. If there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and the current count `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele` plus `ele`, and `maxi` remains unchanged.
