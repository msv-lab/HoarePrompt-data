Output State: **`c` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` (which is now 0) and `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` (which is now 0) and `maxi`.**

In natural language: The variable `c` is set to 0. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The variables `n`, `k`, `l`, `maxi`, `ele` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 0.
