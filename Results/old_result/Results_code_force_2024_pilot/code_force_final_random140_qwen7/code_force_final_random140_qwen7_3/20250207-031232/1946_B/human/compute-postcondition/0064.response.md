State: **`c` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is 0, `ele` must be one of the elements in the list `l`**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is iterating over each element in the list `l`.
2. The only variable in the loop head that needs to be considered is `ele`, as it is the iterator variable.
3. For the loop to execute, `ele` must be one of the elements in the list `l`.
4. All other variables (`c`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `maxi`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and their values do not affect whether the loop will run or not.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `ele` is one of the elements in the list `l`.
