Output State: **`l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l` after processing each element according to the given conditions, `i` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integer inputs from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `maxi`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `l` is updated to contain the newly entered integers.
