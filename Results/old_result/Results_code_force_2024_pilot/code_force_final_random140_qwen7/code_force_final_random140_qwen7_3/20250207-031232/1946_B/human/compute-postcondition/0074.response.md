Output State: **`c` is updated based on the condition, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`**.

Explanation: The line `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum between the current value of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
