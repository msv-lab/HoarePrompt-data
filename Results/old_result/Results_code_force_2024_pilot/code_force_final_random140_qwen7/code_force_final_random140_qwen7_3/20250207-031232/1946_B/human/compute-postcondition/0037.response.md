Output State: **`c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`; `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current value of `maxi`. Since `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `maxi` will be updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. The other variables remain unchanged.
