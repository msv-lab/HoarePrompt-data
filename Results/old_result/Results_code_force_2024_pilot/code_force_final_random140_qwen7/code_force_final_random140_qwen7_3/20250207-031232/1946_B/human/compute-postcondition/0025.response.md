Postcondition: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `ele` is the next element in the list, and `c` is the sum of the original value of `c` (which is 0) and `ele`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to the sum of the original value of `c` and `ele`.**
