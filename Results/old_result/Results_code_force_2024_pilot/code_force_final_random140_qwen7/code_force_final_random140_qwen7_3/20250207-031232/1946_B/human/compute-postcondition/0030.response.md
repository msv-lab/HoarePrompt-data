Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l` after processing each element according to the given conditions, `i` is `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and the value of `int(input())` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. It does not affect the values of `maxi`, `c`, `l`, or `i` directly, but it updates `k` to the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus one. The value of `int(input())` remains the same as the initial state.
