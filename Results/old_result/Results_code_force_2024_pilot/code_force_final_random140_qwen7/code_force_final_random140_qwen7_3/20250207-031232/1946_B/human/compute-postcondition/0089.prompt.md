Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The array a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the array.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l` after processing each element according to the given conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxi` is the maximum value between 0 and any negative elements in the list `l` whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`; `c` is reset to 0 if a new negative element in `l` is found that meets the condition `c <= abs(ele)`, otherwise `c` accumulates the sum of non-negative elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l` that are greater than or equal to 0, or 0 if there are no such elements; `i` is `i_prev + len(l)`, `maxi` is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
