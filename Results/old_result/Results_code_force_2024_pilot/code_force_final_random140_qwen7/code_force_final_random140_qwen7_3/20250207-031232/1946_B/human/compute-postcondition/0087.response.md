Output State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l` that are greater than or equal to 0, or 0 if there are no such elements; `i` is `i_prev + len(l)`, `maxi` is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial `maxi`.**

This means that after executing the line of code `maxi = max(c, maxi)`, the variable `c` retains its value as the sum of all non-negative numbers in the list `l`, or remains 0 if no such numbers exist. The variable `i` is updated to be the sum of its previous value (`i_prev`) and the length of the list `l`. The variable `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between its initial value and the current value of `c`.
