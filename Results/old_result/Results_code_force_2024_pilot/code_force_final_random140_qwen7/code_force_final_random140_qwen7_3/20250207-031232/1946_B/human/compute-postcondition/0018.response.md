Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one element; `c` is increased by the first element of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of the first element (`ele`) from the list `l`. Since `l` is a list with at least one element, `c` is updated by adding the first element of `l` to its current value. The rest of the list `l` remains unchanged, and the variable `c` now holds the sum of its original value and the first element of `l`.
