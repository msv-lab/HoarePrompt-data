Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one element; `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current value of `maxi`. Since `c` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know that `maxi` will now hold the larger of its previous value and `c`. The list `l` remains unchanged.
