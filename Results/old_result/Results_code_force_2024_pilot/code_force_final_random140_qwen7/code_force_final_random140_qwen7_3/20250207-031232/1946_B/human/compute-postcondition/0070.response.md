Output State: **`c` is `0 + ele`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is an element in the list `l` and either `ele >= 0` or `c > abs(ele)`**.

In this output state, the variable `c` is updated to be the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and the current value of `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, including `i`, which is incremented by 1 from its previous value (`i_prev`), `n`, `k`, `l`, `maxi`, and the condition involving `ele`.
