Output State: **`c` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = 0` initializes the variable `maxi` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
