Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of positive integers n and k, and an array of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the array elements and prints the result for each test case. The final output for each test case is computed using the formula \(2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \sum(\text{array})\) modulo \(1000000007\), where \(\text{maxi}\) is the maximum value obtained from either the cumulative sum of non-negative elements in the array or a special condition involving negative elements, and \(\sum(\text{array})\) is the total sum of all elements in the array.**
