Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one element ([5, -3]), `ele` is -3, `c` is 3, `maxi` is 0**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. Given that `ele` is -3, `c` (which was initially 0) is updated to 0 + (-3) = 3. The values of `l`, `ele`, and `maxi` remain unchanged from their initial states.
