Postcondition: `l` is a list with at least one element. If the element `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the first element of `l`.
