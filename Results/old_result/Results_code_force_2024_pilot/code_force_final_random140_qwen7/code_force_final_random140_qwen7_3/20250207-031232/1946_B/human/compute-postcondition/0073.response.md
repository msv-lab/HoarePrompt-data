Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `c` is 0
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`
   - `ele` is an element in the list `l`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `l`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0.
   - Otherwise, `c` is updated to `0 + ele`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variable that changes within the loop is `c`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `l`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `i` and `n` are not modified within the loop, they remain unchanged.
   - `maxi` is updated based on the value of `c` but it does not change the loop condition directly.
   - `ele` is the current element being processed and will change in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `c`. The other states (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `maxi`) remain the same unless explicitly changed within the loop.

6. **Next Element in the List:**
   - The next element `ele` in the list `l` will be processed in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
- `c` is updated based on the condition (either remains 0 or is updated to `0 + ele`).
- `i` remains `i_prev + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `l` remains the same.
- `maxi` may be updated based on the new value of `c`.
- `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `c` after the loop body execution, we represent it as `c` (updated based on the condition).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`c` is updated based on the condition, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.
