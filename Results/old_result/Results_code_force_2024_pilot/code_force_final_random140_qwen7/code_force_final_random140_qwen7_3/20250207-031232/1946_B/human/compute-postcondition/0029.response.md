Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l` after processing each element according to the given conditions.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains unchanged from the previous iteration since it is read once per loop iteration.

5. **Update the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, if the previous value of `i` was `k`, then the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains the same as it was read at the beginning of the loop.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l` after processing each element according to the given conditions, `i` is `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and the value of `int(input())` remains the same.**
