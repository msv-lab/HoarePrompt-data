Output State: **`c` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `ele` is one of the elements in the list `l`, and the current value of `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**

Explanation: The code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum between the current value of `c` (which is 0) and the previous value of `maxi`. Since `c` is 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `maxi` will be updated to the absolute value of `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged.
