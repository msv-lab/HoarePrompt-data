Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele`, which is the current element being processed in the list `l`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop updates the state based on the current element `ele` and the current value of `c`. Specifically:
   - If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` (which is now 0) and `maxi`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value, and `maxi` remains the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

3. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `c` is updated based on the condition.
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
   - `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `c` will be updated based on the current `ele`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 (`i_prev + 1`).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `maxi` will be updated if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.
   - `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.

Given that we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we focus on the variables that change within the loop and the ones that remain constant.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `c` will be updated based on the current `ele`.
- `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `maxi` will be updated if the condition is met.

Since we don't know the exact value of `ele` at the start of the next iteration, we can only say that `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`c` is updated based on the condition, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
