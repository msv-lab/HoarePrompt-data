Output State: **`c` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

In this case, the code simply initializes the variable `c` to 0. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
