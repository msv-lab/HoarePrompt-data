Output State: **`c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` updates the value of `c` by adding the value of `ele` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
