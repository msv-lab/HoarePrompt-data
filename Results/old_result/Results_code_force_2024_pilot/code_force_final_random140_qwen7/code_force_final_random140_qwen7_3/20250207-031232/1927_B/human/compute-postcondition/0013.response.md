Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is 26; `beg` is `a_map[a[3]]`; `res` is `res` + `sam[a_map[a[3]] % 27]`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression inside `res` becomes `res + sam[a_map[a[3]] % 27]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `beg`) remain unchanged.
