Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is 26; `beg` is `a_map[a[0]]`**

Explanation: The code `beg = a_map[a[i]]` assigns the value of `a_map[a[0]]` to the variable `beg`. Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is 0, `n` is 26, and `beg` is the value of `a_map[a[0]]`.
