Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the loop, which is a positive integer representing the length of the string `sam`.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `a_map` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to `n-1` maps to 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string `sam`.
   - `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where \(0 \leq a_i < n\) for all \(i\).
   - `sam` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'`.
   - `res` is an empty string.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n` must hold true.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to 0.
   - The value of `n` should be set to the length of the string `sam`, which is 26 (since `sam` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 26**
