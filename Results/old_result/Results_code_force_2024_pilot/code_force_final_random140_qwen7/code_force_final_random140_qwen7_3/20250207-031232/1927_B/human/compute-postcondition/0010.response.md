Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 26, `res` is `sam[a_map[a[2]] % 27] + sam[a_map[a[2]] % 27]`, `beg` is `a_map[a[2]]`, `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a_map[a[2]]` by 1. Since `i` was initially 2, the index remains the same. All other variables (`n`, `res`, `beg`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1.
