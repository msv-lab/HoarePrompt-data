Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 26, `beg` is `a_map[a[3]]`, `res` is `res` + `sam[a_map[a[3]] % 27]`, `a_map[a[3]]` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a_map[a[3]]` by 1 since `i` is 3. The other variables (`n`, `beg`, `res`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
