Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It returns a string `res` that is the concatenation of characters from the string `sam` based on the values in `a_map` modulo 27. After processing all elements in `a`, it increments the value in `a_map` corresponding to the last element in `a` by 1.**
