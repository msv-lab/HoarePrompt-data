Output State: `i` is 26; `n` is 26; `res` is the concatenation of `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for all `i` from 0 to 25; `beg` is `a_map[a[25]]`; `a_map[a[25]]` is increased by 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 26 iterations (since `n` is 26), the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The string `res` will be constructed by appending `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for each iteration, which means it will contain 26 characters, one for each index from 0 to 25. The variable `beg` will hold the value of `a_map[a[25]]` after the last increment, and `a_map[a[25]]` itself will be incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
