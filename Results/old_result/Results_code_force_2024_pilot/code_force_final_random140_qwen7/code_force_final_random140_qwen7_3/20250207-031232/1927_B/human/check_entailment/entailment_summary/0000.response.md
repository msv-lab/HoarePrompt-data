Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the alphabet string `sam` with all lowercase Latin letters.
2. It creates a dictionary `a_map` to keep track of the occurrences of each character index in the string `s`.
3. The loop iterates through each index `i` of the trace array `a`.
4. For each index `i`, it uses the value at `a[i]` to determine the character to add to the result string `res`. Specifically, it uses `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` to get the character from the alphabet string, ensuring that the character wraps around if the index exceeds the length of the alphabet string.
5. It updates the count in `a_map` for the current index `a[i]` after adding the character to `res`.
6. The function finally returns the constructed string `res`.

The logic in the function `func_1` appears to be consistent with the problem requirements. Each index in the trace array `a` determines the position of the character in the resulting string `s`, and the use of modulo 27 ensures that the alphabet wraps around correctly.

Correctness: **True**
