Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 26, `res` is `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]`, `beg` is `a_map[a[2]]`, `a_map[a[2]]` is assigned the value of `a_map[a[i]]` which is `a_map[a[2]]`**.

In this case, the variable `beg` is reassigned to `a_map[a[i]]`, and since `i` is 2, `beg` is now `a_map[a[2]]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
