Output State: **`results` list now contains `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `freq` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `freq` is a dictionary that will automatically assign an integer value (0) to any key that does not yet exist when accessed. None of the other variables (`results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`) are affected by this line of code.
