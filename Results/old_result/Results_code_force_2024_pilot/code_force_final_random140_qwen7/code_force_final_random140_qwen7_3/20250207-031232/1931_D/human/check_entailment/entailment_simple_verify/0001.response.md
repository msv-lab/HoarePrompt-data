### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Input Parsing
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

#### Data Structure Initialization
- A list `test_cases` is used to store the parameters and arrays for each test case.
- This is done correctly using a loop that iterates `t` times.

#### Function Definition
- The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case.
- It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

#### Processing Each Test Case
- For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
- It uses a dictionary `freq` from the `defaultdict` module to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
- It calculates the required modular values `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` for each element in the array.
- If the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, it adds the count to `beautiful_count`.
- It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
- Finally, it appends `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

#### Output
- The program prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Modular Arithmetic Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is correct.
     ```python
     required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
     required_mod_y = mod_y
     ```
   - These calculations ensure that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The use of `defaultdict` to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs is appropriate.
   - This ensures that we can efficiently check if a required pair has already been seen.

3. **Pair Matching**:
   - The logic for matching pairs based on the conditions is correctly implemented.
   - For each element `num` in the array, it checks if the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq` and increments `beautiful_count` accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program step by step and comparing it with the problem description and the annotated code, we can conclude that the program is correct. The logic for calculating and counting the beautiful pairs is sound, and the implementation matches the requirements.
