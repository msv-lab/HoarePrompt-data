The only objects in the loop head are `case` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more cases in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the `results` list contains `beautiful_count`, and all other variables remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must contain at least one more element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `test_cases` must contain at least one more element, and all other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`results` list now contains `beautiful_count`, all other variables remain unchanged, `test_cases` must contain at least one more element**
