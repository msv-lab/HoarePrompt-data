Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `beautiful_count` to 0. It does not affect any other variables or lists. Therefore, the values of `results`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `freq` remain unchanged from their initial states.
