Postcondition: **`beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`**.

This postcondition summarizes that if the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in the dictionary `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is updated to `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, and the other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition. If the tuple is not found, `beautiful_count` remains 0, and the other variables also remain unchanged.
