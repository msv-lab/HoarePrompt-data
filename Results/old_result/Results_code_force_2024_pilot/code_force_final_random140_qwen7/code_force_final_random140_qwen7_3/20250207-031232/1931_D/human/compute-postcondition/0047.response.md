Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` remains the same, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `mod_y` remains the same, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

This means that the `beautiful_count` variable has been incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, while `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
