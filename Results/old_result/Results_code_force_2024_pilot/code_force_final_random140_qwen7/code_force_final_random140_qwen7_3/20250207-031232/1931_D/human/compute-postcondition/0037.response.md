Output State: **`n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the frequency dictionary `freq` for each element in the original array `a`; `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`; `test_cases` is a non-empty list (at least one case); `case['array']` is an empty list; `a` is an empty list; `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `case['params']` to `n`, `x`, and `y`. It does not affect the values of `beautiful_count`, `results`, `test_cases`, `case['array']`, `a`, or `freq`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now directly referenced from `case['params']`, but their actual values are not specified in the initial state.
