t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a list containing three integers n, x, and y such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= x, y <= 10^9. Additionally, test_cases is a list of such triplets, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Each element a_i in the array a for each test case satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
