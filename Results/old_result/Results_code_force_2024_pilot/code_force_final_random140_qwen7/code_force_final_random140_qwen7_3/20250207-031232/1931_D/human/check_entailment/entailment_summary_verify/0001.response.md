### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Data Structure Initialization**:
   - A list `test_cases` is used to store the parameters and arrays for each test case.
   - This is done correctly using a loop that iterates `t` times.

3. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

4. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` from the `defaultdict` module to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
   - It calculates the required modular values `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` for each element in the array.
   - If the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, it adds the count to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - Finally, it appends `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Check

- **Modular Arithmetic Calculation**: The calculation of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is correct.
  - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
  - `required_mod_y = mod_y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

- **Frequency Counting**: The use of `defaultdict` to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs is appropriate.
  - This helps in efficiently finding pairs that satisfy the conditions.

- **Pair Matching**: The logic for matching pairs based on the conditions is correctly implemented.
  - The program checks if the required pair exists in the frequency dictionary and increments the count accordingly.

- **Output**: The program correctly prints the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Function Summary Validation

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`:
- It processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
- It retains the final values of local variables after processing each test case.
- It returns a list of counts for each test case.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and the function summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
