Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`**.

This means that the code has unpacked the `params` from the current `case` in `test_cases` into three variables: `n`, `x`, and `y`. The `results` list remains unchanged, and `test_cases` is still a non-empty list.
