Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `freq` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `freq` is now a dictionary where each key is associated with an integer value, initialized to 0 if the key does not exist. The values of other variables (`results`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
