Output State: The `results` list will contain the final value of `beautiful_count` after all iterations of the loop have completed. This value represents the total count of pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` found across all elements in all arrays specified in `test_cases`. All other variables such as `a`, `x`, `y`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. The `test_cases` list will also remain unchanged, as it was initialized and used within the loop but not modified outside of it.
