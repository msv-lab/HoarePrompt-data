Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This calculation does not affect the values of `a`, `num`, or `mod_y`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions. The new variable `required_mod_x` is introduced with the value of `(x - mod_x) % x`.
