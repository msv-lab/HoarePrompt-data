Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and `((required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq)` is true.**

Explanation: The line of code `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` increments the value of `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
