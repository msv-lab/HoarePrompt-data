Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the test cases and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, it calculates the number of beautiful pairs using the given conditions.
3. The logic for determining the beautiful pairs is correct:
   - It uses modular arithmetic to find pairs `(i, j)` such that both conditions are satisfied.
   - It maintains a frequency dictionary to count how many times each `(mod_x, mod_y)` combination appears in the array.
   - For each element in the array, it checks if there exists another element with the required modular conditions and increments the count accordingly.
4. The program iterates through all test cases and collects the results in a list.
5. The final output matches the expected format and values provided in the example.

Given the above points, the program logic and implementation appear to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
