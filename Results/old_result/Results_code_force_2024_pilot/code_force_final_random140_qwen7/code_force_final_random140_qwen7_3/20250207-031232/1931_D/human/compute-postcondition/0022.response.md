Output State: **`beautiful_count` is `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`**

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Since `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are defined as `(x - mod_x) % x` and `mod_y` respectively, the updated value of `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value (`freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1` or 0) and `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
