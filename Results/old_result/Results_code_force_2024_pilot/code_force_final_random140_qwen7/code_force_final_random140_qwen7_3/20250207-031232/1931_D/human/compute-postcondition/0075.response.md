Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`**.

Explanation: The line `beautiful_count = 0` initializes the variable `beautiful_count` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `freq`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
