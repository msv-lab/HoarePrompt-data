Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `a` is given as `case['array']`, which is part of `test_cases`.
   - `num` is the variable being iterated over in the list `a`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `a` (which is `case['array']`) must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `a` is `case['array']` and `test_cases` is a non-empty list, we need to ensure that `case['array']` is not empty.
   - `num` will take on each value from `a` during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it changes with each iteration.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `case['array']` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`**.
