Postcondition: `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, where `num` is the current element in the list `a`.
