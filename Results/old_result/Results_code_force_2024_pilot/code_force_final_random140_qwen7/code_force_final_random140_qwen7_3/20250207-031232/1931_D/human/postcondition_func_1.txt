The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list of \( n \) integers. It then calls another function `func_1` with these test cases as input. After processing, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed, and the output contains the results of the processing for each test case.
