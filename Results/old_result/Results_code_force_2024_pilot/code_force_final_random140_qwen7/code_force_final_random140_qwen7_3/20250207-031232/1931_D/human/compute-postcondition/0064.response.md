Output State: **`mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` remains unchanged, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.

This means that the value of `required_mod_x` is now `(x - mod_x) % x`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
