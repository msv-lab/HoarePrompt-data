Output State: **`beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % y` to `mod_y`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `mod_y` is updated, while all other variables remain in their previous states.
