Output State: **`mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1 (so it is now `freq[mod_x, mod_y] + 1`), `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `num` is the current element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the frequency dictionary `freq` has been updated to increment the count for the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` by 1. Additionally, the `beautiful_count` has been incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, which is the current value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` since `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
