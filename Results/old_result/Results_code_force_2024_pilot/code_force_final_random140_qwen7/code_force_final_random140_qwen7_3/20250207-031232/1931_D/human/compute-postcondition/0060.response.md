Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num` from the list `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `num`.

3. **Determine the new state of `num`**: Since `num` is the current element in the list `a`, for the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the list.

4. **Adjust the other variables**: The other variables (`mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]`, and `beautiful_count`) are derived from the operations within the loop body and do not change based on the loop head alone. They will be updated inside the loop body during each iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1 (so it is now `freq[mod_x, mod_y] + 1`), `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`.**

However, since we are only adjusting the state of the objects in the loop head, the final answer is:

**State: `num` is the next element in the list `a`**
