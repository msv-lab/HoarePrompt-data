Output State: **`beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x**.

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` which is `(x - mod_x) % x`. This does not affect any other variables. The values of `beautiful_count`, `results`, `test_cases`, `case['array']`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
