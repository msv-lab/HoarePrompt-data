Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of triplets where each triplet consists of integers n, x, and y. For each triplet, the function processes an array a of length n, where each element a_i is between 1 and 10^9. The function calculates the total count of pairs (mod_x, required_mod_y) across all arrays specified in `test_cases` and returns a list containing this count.**
