The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of triplets where each triplet consists of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`. For each triplet, it processes an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9. It calculates the total count of pairs `(mod_x, required_mod_y)` across all arrays specified in `test_cases` and returns a list containing this count. After processing, all local variables such as `a`, `x`, `y`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, while `test_cases` remains unchanged.
