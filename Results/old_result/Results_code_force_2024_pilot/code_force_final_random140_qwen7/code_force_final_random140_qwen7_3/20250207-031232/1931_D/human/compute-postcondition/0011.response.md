Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` simply assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
