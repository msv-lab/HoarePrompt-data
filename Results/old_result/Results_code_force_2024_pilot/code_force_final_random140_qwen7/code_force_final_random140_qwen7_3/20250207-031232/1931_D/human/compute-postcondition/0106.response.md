Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` must be fully processed, meaning every element in `a` has been iterated over. For each `num` in `a`, `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`, and `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`. The variable `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1 for each `num`. Additionally, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]` for each `num`. The final value of `beautiful_count` is the sum of all such increments throughout the loop's iterations.
