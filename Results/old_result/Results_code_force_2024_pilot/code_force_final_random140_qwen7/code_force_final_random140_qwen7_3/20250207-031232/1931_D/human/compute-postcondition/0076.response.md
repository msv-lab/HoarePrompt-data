Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `num` (the variable used to iterate through the elements of `a`) and `a` (the list itself).

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num`: This variable will take on each element of the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a`: This is the list being iterated over.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The initial value of `num` will be the first element of the list `a`.

4. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`.
   - `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `a` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty.
   - The initial value of `num` will be the first element of `a`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `a` must have at least one element, and `num` will be set to the first element of `a` during the first iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`**
