Output State: **`beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` if and only if `beautiful_count` is updated accordingly.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq`. Since `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, the key in `freq` being updated is `(mod_x, required_mod_y)`. The value associated with this key is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
