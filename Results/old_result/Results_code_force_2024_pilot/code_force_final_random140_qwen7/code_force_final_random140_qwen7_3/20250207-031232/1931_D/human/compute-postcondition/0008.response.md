Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `num % x`**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` which is the modulus of `num` divided by `x`. However, since `num` is not defined in the initial state, `mod_x` is simply expressed as `num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
