Output State: **`beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first element, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` which is `(x - (num % y)) % x`. This value is stored in the variable `mod_x`. Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged. The tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is checked to see if it exists in `freq`, but since no action is taken based on this check, `beautiful_count` remains as it was initially defined.
