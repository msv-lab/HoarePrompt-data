Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` which is defined as `(x - mod_x) % x`. Here, `mod_x` is `num % y`. Since `num % y` is already calculated and stored in `mod_x`, the new value of `required_mod_x` is derived from `x`, `mod_x`, and the modulus operation. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `num`, the expression for `mod_x` remains as `num % y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
