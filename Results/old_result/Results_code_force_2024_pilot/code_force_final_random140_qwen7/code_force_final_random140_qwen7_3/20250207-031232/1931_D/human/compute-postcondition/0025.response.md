Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, the relevant variables in the loop head are `num`, `a`, and `case`.

2. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `num` is the current element being processed in the list `a`.
   - `a` is updated by removing the first element of the current `case['array']`.
   - `case` is the current test case dictionary.

3. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` or remains 0.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `test_cases` is a non-empty list.
   - `case['array']` must not be empty.
   - `n` is `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first element.
   - `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.
   - `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `a` will be the list `case['array']` without its first two elements.
   - `case` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `beautiful_count` remains unchanged unless the new `num` affects it.
   - `results` remains an empty list.
   - `test_cases` remains a non-empty list.
   - `case['array']` becomes the list `case['array']` without its first two elements.
   - `n` remains `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` remains `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` remains `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is now the list `case['array']` without its first two elements.
   - `freq` remains the same.
   - `mod_x` and `mod_y` will be recalculated based on the new `num`.
   - `required_mod_y` remains `mod_y`.
   - `required_mod_x` remains `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` will be incremented by 1.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`beautiful_count` is either `freq[(mod_x, required_mod_y)] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` or remains 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `case['array']` must not be empty, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list `case['array']` without its first two elements, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % y)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**
