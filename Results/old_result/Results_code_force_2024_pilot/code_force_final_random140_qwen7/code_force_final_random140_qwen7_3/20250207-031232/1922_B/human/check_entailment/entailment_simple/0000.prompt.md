Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: Output State: `current_index` is 68, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is a list containing the final answer `[final_ans]` repeated `t` times, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[47]` to `data[63]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[47]`, `i` is `n + 2` initially but changes during the loop iterations.
    #
    #This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `current_index` is now 68, which means it has processed all the data up to the last element. The `results` list contains the final answer calculated by the loop, repeated `t` times, as the loop runs `t` times. The `hashing` dictionary is empty because no more pairs of consecutive equal elements were found in the remaining data. The list `a` contains the last set of integers processed, sorted, and `n` is the count of these integers. The variable `i` starts at `n + 2` for the first iteration of the inner loop but increments with each pass through the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `results` list contains the final answer calculated by the loop, repeated `t` times, and the loop has completed all its iterations.
