Output State: **`current_index` is 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer from `data[current_index]`**.

The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `t`, `results`, `hashing`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
