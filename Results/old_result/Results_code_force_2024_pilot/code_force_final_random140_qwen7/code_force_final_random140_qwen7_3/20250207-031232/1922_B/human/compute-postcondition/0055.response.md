Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is `a[1]` and the value is `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` is exactly the length of `a`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: 
- The `current_index` remains unchanged at 13.
- The `t` variable remains unchanged as it was within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The `results` list is appended with the value of `ans`, making it `[ans]`.
- The `hashing` dictionary starts with the key `a[1]` having a value of `0`. No changes are made to this dictionary during the loop.
- The list `a` is sorted, and `n` is the length of `a`. After the loop, `i` is set to `n - 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`.
