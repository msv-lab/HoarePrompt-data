Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `current_index` is 41
   - `results` is `[ans]`
   - `hashing` is updated such that if `a[i]` is not in the `hashing` dictionary, then `hashing[a[i]]` is set to `i + 1`
   - `ans` is `hashing[a[42]]`
   - `i` is 42
   - `n` must be at least 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 42.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 42, `n` must be greater than 43 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 43.
   - `n` must remain at least 2 (it was already stated that `n` must be at least 2).

6. **Final state**:
   - `current_index` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `results` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `hashing` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`current_index` is 41, `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is updated such that if `a[i]` is not in the `hashing` dictionary, then `hashing[a[i]]` is set to `i + 1`, `ans` is `hashing[a[43]]`, `i` is 43, and `n` must be greater than 43**.
