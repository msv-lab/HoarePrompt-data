Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_index` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    hashing = {}
    n = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(data[current_index]))
        current_index += 1
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] not in hashing:
            hashing[a[i]] = 0
        hashing[a[i]] += i
        if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
            ans += hashing[a[i]]
    results.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is `a[1]` and the value is `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` is exactly the length of `a`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and its value is the sum of indices `i` for which the key appears consecutively in `a`, `ans` is the cumulative sum of values in `hashing` for each key that has consecutive occurrences in `a`, `current_index` is 30, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n + 2` initially but changes during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_index` is 44, `results` is `[final_ans, ans]`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is of the form `a[i]: i` for every consecutive pair of elements `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` that are equal, and `final_ans` is the sum of all values in the `hashing` dictionary.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
