Output State: **`current_index` is 32, `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is the cumulative sum of values in `hashing` for each key that has consecutive occurrences in `a`, `n` is the integer value of `data[31]`, `i` is `n + 2` initially but changes during the loop iterations, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`.**

Explanation: The line `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` was 31, so after executing this line, `current_index` becomes 32. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
