Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is incremented by `i`.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by `i`. This affects the value of `hashing[a[i]]` but does not change the conditions under which `ans` is updated. The value of `n` remains the same as it was before, being the integer value of `data[15]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 as per the postcondition. The behavior of `ans` depends on whether `a[i]` is in `hashing`, but since the code only updates `hashing[a[i]]`, the original conditions for updating `ans` remain intact.
