Output State: **`current_index` is 7, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[4]), int(data[7])], `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `a.append(int(data[current_index]))` appends the value of `int(data[current_index])` to the list `a`. Initially, `current_index` is 6, so `a.append(int(data[6]))` is executed, making `current_index` become 7. The value of `a` is updated to include `int(data[6])` in addition to the existing value `int(data[4])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
