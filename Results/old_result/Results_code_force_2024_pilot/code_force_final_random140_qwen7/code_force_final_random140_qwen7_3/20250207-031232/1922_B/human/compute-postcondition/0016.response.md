Output State: **`current_index` is 8, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[4]), int(data[7])], `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The line `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Since `current_index` was initially 7, it is now 8. The values of `t`, `results`, `hashing`, `a`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
