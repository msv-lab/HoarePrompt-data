Output State: **`current_index` is 41, `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is updated such that if `a[i]` is not in the `hashing` dictionary, then `hashing[a[i]]` is set to `i + 1`, `ans` is `hashing[a[42]]`, `i` is 42, `n` must be at least 2, and `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments `ans` by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 42, so `a[i]` is `a[42]`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the current value of `ans` plus the value of `hashing[a[42]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
