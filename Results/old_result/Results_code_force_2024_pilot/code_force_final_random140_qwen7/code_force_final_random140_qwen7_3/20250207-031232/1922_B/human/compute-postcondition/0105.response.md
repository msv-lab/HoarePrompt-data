Output State: **`results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is the cumulative sum of values in `hashing` for each key that has consecutive occurrences in `a`, `current_index` is 31, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n + 2` initially but changes during the loop iterations, `n` is the integer value of `data[31]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[current_index])` assigns the value of `data[current_index]` (which is `data[30]` since `current_index` was 30) to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `current_index` is incremented to 31.
