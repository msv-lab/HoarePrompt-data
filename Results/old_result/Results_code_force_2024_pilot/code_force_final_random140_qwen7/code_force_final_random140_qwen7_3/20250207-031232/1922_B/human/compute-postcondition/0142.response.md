Output State: **`current_index` is 42, `results` is `[new_ans]`, `hashing[a[44]]` is 0, `new_ans` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `hashing[a[i]] = 0` sets the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to 0. Since `i` is not defined in the context, it defaults to the last used index, which is 44 based on the initial conditions. Therefore, `hashing[a[44]]` is set to 0. Additionally, since the condition `a[42] == a[43]` is not checked (as `i` is not defined), `new_ans` remains 0.
