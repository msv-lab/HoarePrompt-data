Output State: **`ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i`, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments the value of `ans` by `hashing[a[i]]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
