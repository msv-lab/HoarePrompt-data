Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions**:
   - `current_index` is 34.
   - `results` is `[ans]`.
   - `hashing` is an empty dictionary.
   - `ans` is the cumulative sum of values in `hashing` for each key that has consecutive occurrences in `a`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[31]` and must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `previous_i + 1` (less than `n`).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\).
   - `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]` with the additional element `int(data[32])` appended to it.
   - `a` now contains `int(data[33])` appended to itself.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `for i in range(n)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `previous_i + 1` and was less than `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `previous_i + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `current_index` does not change within the loop.
   - `results` does not change within the loop.
   - `hashing` does not change within the loop.
   - `ans` does not change within the loop.
   - `t` does not change within the loop.
   - `a` does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be updated is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`current_index` is 34; `results` is `[ans]`; `hashing` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is the cumulative sum of values in `hashing` for each key that has consecutive occurrences in `a`; `n` is the integer value of `data[31]` and must be at least 1; `i` is `previous_i + 2` (less than `n`); `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\); `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]` with the additional element `int(data[32])` appended to it; `a` now contains `int(data[33])` appended to itself.**
