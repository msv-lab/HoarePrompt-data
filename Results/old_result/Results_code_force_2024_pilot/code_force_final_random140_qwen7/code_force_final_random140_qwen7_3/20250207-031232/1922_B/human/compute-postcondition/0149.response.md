Output State: `current_index` is 42, `results` is `[new_ans]`, `new_ans` is 44, and `ans` is 44.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the final value of `ans` is 44. This means that during the loop's execution, there was at least one instance where `a[i]` was equal to `a[i + 1]`, and the corresponding value from the `hashing` dictionary was added to `ans`. The `current_index` remains 42 because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-2`, and since we started with `i` as 41, the last increment would make `i` 42. The `results` list contains the final value of `ans`, which is 44.
