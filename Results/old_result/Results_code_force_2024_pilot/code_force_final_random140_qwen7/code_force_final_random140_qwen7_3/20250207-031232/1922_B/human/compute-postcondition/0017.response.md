Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values of these variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, but its exact value is not specified.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the values for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, it will increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` (which will be 2) must still be less than `n`. This means `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `current_index`, `t`, `results`, `hashing`, `a`, and `data` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `current_index` is 8, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[4]), int(data[7])], `n` is an integer from `data[5]` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
