Postcondition: `current_index` is 41, `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is updated such that if `a[i]` is not in the `hashing` dictionary, then `hashing[a[i]]` is set to `i + 1`, `ans` is `hashing[a[42]]`, `i` is 42, and `n` must be at least 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, `ans` remains as `hashing[a[42]]`.
