Postcondition: `current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 3. If `a[3]` is equal to `a[2]`, then `ans` is set to `hashing[a[2]]`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.
