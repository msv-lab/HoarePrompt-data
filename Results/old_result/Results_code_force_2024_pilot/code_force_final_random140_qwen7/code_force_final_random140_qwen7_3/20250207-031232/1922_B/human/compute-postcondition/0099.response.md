Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is incremented by `i`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is incremented by `i`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and `hashing[a[i]]` is incremented by `i`.
