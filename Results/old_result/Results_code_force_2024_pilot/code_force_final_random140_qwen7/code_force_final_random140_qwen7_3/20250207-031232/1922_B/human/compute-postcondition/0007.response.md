Output State: **`current_index` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `hashing`. This does not affect the values of `current_index`, `t`, or `results`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
