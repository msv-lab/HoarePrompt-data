Postcondition: `current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 8, `ans` is `hashing[a[6]]`, and `a[i]` is not in `hashing`. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, `hashing` remains unchanged.
