Output State: **`i` is less than `n - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `hashing[a[i]]` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` sets the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to 0. This directly updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` from its previous state, which was the original value plus `i`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
