Postcondition: `current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 8, `ans` is `8`, and if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` remains `8`.
