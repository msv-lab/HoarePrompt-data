Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using `split()` method.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `data` is created and assigned the result of splitting the input string.
