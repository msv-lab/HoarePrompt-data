You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    current_index = 0
    t = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        hashing = {}
        
        n = int(data[current_index])
        
        current_index += 1
        
        a = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(int(data[current_index]))
            current_index += 1
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if a[i] not in hashing:
                hashing[a[i]] = 0
            hashing[a[i]] += i
            if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
                ans += hashing[a[i]]
        
        results.append(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `current_index` is 68, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is a list containing the final answer `[final_ans]` repeated `t` times, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[47]` to `data[63]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[47]`, `i` is `n + 2` initially but changes during the loop iterations.
    #
    #This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `current_index` is now 68, which means it has processed all the data up to the last element. The `results` list contains the final answer calculated by the loop, repeated `t` times, as the loop runs `t` times. The `hashing` dictionary is empty because no more pairs of consecutive equal elements were found in the remaining data. The list `a` contains the last set of integers processed, sorted, and `n` is the count of these integers. The variable `i` starts at `n + 2` for the first iteration of the inner loop but increments with each pass through the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `results` list contains the final answer calculated by the loop, repeated `t` times, and the loop has completed all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns nothing explicitly but processes the data according to the given constraints and relationships.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
