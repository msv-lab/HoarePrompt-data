Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `current_index` is 68, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is a list containing the final answer `[final_ans]` repeated `t` times, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[47]` to `data[63]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[47]`, `i` is `n + 2` initially but changes during the loop iterations.

This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `current_index` is now 68, which means it has processed all the data up to the last element. The `results` list contains the final answer calculated by the loop, repeated `t` times, as the loop runs `t` times. The `hashing` dictionary is empty because no more pairs of consecutive equal elements were found in the remaining data. The list `a` contains the last set of integers processed, sorted, and `n` is the count of these integers. The variable `i` starts at `n + 2` for the first iteration of the inner loop but increments with each pass through the loop.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `result` is the first element of the `results` list, `current_index` is 68, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[47]` to `data[63]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[47]`, `i` is `n + 2` initially but changes during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: 

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `result` is the next element in the `results` iterable, `results` must have at least one more element




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
