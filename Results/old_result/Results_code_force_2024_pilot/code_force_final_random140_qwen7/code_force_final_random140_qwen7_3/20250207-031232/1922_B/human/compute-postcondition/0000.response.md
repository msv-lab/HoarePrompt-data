Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; the input reading process is changed to using `sys.stdin.read` instead of the default input method.**

Explanation: The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` function to read from `sys.stdin.read`. This changes how the input is read but does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or the list of integers. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as described in the initial state, and the only change is in the method used to read input.
