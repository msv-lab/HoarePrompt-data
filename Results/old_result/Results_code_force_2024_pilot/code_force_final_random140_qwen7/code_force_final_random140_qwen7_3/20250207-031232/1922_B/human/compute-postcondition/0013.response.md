Output State: **`current_index` is 6, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[4])], `n` is an integer from `data[5]`, `i` is 0**

The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
