Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`.
   - `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same because it is determined by `data[15]` and does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `hashing[a[i]]` will depend on the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same, which is the integer value of `data[15]`.
   - `hashing[a[i]]` will be the original value plus the new `i` (which is `i + 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is less than `n - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i + 1`.**
