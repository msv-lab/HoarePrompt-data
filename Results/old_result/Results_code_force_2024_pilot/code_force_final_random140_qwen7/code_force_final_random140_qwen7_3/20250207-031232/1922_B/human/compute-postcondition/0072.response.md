Output State: **`current_index` is 30, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n + 2`**.

Explanation: The code sorts the list `a` which contains integers from `data[15]` to `data[29]`. After sorting, `a` becomes a sorted list of these integers. The values of `current_index`, `t`, `results`, `hashing`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
