Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `0`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 8, `ans` is `hashing[a[6]]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to `0`. Given that `i` is `8`, the code sets `hashing[a[8]]` to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
