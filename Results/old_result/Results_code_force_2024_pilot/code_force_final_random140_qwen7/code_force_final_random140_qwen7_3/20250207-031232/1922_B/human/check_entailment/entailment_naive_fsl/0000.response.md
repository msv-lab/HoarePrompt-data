Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to counting pairs of indices with equal values in the sorted array.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
1 1 1 1
```

The expected output for this test case is `4`, because there are 4 ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length (each combination of three sticks of length 1).

However, the provided program will output `0` for this test case, which is incorrect. This is because the program is counting pairs of indices with equal values, not solving the triangle formation problem.

The program should iterate through the sorted array and check the conditions for forming a triangle (i.e., the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_triangle_ways(n, a):
    a.sort()
    count = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        k = i + 2
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            while k < n and a[i] + a[j] > a[k]:
                k += 1
            count += k - j - 1
    return count

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    current_index = 0
    t = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[current_index])
        current_index += 1
        a = []
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(int(data[current_index]))
            current_index += 1
        results.append(count_triangle_ways(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_1()
```

This corrected program should now correctly count the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles from the given sticks.
