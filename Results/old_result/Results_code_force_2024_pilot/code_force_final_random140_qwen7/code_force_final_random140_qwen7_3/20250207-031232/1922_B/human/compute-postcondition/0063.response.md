Output State: **`current_index` is 16, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[15])], `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `i` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` was 15, so after executing the code, `current_index` becomes 16. All other variables remain unchanged.
