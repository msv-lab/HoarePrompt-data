Output State: **`i` is less than `n - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i`, and `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is not in `hashing`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by `i`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `ans` directly, except for updating `hashing[a[i]]` as described. The condition that `i` is less than `n - 1` and the definition of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged.
