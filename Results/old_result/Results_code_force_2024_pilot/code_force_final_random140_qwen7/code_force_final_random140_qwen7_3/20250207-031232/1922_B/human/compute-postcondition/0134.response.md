Output State: **`current_index` is 41, `results` is `[ans]`, `hashing` is updated such that `hashing[a[i]]` is set to `0`, `ans` is `0`, `i` is 43, and `n` must be greater than 43.**

Explanation: The code updates the `hashing` dictionary by setting `hashing[a[i]]` to `0`. Given that `i` is `43`, it means `hashing[a[43]]` is now `0`. The value of `ans` is also updated to `0` since `ans` is defined as `hashing[a[43]]`. All other variables (`current_index`, `results`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
