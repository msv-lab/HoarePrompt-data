Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute as long as `n - 1` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - The initial value of `i` is given as 3, but the loop starts with `i = 0` because `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, the initial value of `i` should be adjusted to 0.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
