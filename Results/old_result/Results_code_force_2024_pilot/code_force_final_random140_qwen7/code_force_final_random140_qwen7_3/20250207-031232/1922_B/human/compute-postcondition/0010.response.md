Output State: **`current_index` is 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from `data[current_index]`**.

The code initializes an empty list `a`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `current_index`, `t`, `results`, `hashing`, and `n` remain unchanged.
