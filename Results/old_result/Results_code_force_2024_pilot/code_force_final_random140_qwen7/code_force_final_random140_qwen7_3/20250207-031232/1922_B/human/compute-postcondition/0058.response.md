Output State: **`current_index` is 14, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is sorted, `n` is exactly the length of `a`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[current_index]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[current_index])` assigns the value of `data[current_index]` (which is an integer) to the variable `n`. The `current_index` is incremented by 1 because the next element in `data` is being accessed. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
