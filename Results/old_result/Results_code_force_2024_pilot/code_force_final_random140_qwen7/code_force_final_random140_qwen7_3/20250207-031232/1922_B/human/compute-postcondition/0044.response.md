Postcondition: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 7, `ans` is `hashing[a[6]]`. If `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `hashing[a[7]]`.**
