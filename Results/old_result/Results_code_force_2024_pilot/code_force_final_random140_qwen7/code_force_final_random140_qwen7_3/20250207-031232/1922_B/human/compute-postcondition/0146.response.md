Output State: **`current_index` is 42, `results` is `[new_ans]`, `new_ans` is 0, and `ans` is 44.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it. Given that `i` is equal to `current_index`, which is 42, and `a[44]` is hashed to 44, the value added to `ans` is 44. The other variables (`current_index`, `results`, and `new_ans`) remain unchanged.
