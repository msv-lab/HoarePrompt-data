Output State: **`current_index` is 15, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is sorted, `n` is now the integer value of `data[current_index]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` was 14, so after executing this line, `current_index` becomes 15. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to be the integer value of `data[current_index]`, which is `data[15]` now.
