Output State: **`current_index` is 15, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `results` is [ans], `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[current_index]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code `a = []` initializes `a` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
