Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The variable `n` remains the same because it is determined by the value of `data[15]` and does not change within the loop.

4. **Update the state**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously less than `n - 1`, it will now be equal to the previous value of `i` + 1.
   - `n` remains the same, which is the integer value of `data[15]`.

Given this information, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is less than `n - 1` (with `i` incremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

To explicitly state the values:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is less than `n - 1` (with `i` incremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is the original value plus `i`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
