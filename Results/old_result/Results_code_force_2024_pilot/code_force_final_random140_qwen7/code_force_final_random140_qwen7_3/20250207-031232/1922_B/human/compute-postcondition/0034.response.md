Output State: **`current_index` is 13, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with key `a[1]` and value `1`, `a` is sorted, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `ans` is `hashing[a[2]]**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `hashing[a[1]]` is 1. After the code executes, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `a` is sorted and `i` is now 3, `a[i]` refers to `a[3]`. The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + hashing[a[2]]`, but since the exact value of `hashing[a[2]]` is not specified, we only know that `ans` is now the sum of its previous value (which was 1) and the value of `hashing[a[2]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
