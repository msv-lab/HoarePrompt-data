Output State: **`i` is 1; `leftOnes` must be greater than 1; `bOnes` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial unspecified value that must be greater than 1. Since it was initially greater than 1, adding 1 to it results in a new value that is at least 2. The values of `i` and `leftOnes` remain unchanged.
