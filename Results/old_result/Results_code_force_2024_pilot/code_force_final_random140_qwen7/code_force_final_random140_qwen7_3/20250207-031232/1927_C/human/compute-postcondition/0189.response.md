Postcondition: `leftOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, if `i` is in `b`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`.
