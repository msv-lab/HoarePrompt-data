Postcondition: `leftOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 1 (if `i` is in `a`) or 0 (if `i` is not in `a`), `bOnes` is 1 (if `i` is in `b` and `i` is in `a` is false) or remains 0 (if `i` is not in `b` or `i` is in both `a` and `b`), the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`.
