Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `aOnes` to 0. None of the other variables (`leftOnes`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
