Postcondition: **`leftOnes` is 1, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` must be at least 3, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and if `i` is in `b`, `bOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, no change is made to `bOnes` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
