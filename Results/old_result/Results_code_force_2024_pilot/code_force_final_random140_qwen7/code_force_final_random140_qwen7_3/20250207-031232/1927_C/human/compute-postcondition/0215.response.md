Postcondition: `leftOnes` is either 2, 1, or 0, `i` is either 3 or 4, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are either 0 or 1, `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `a`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
