Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the actual values are not specified in the initial state, the only thing we can say for certain is that these variables now hold integers entered by the user.
