Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split.**

Explanation: The code `b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a frozenset from these integers. Since the initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are not affected by this operation, they remain as initially described. The new variable `b` is created and assigned the frozenset of integers entered by the user.
