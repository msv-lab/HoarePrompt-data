Output State: **`leftOnes` is either 2 or 1; `i` is either 2 or 3; `aOnes` and `bOnes` are either 0 or 1; `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false; `t` is `t + 1`; `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 3; `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `leftOnes` is incremented by 1. Since `leftOnes` was initially either 1 or 0, after the increment, it will be either 2 (if it was initially 1) or 1 (if it was initially 0). All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
