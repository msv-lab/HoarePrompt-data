Postcondition: `leftOnes` is 0, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` must be at least 1, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 1 or 0, `bOnes` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is in `b`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, and either `i` is in `a` with `aOnes` set to 1, or `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b` with `bOnes` being 0 or 1 and the loop or if statement is exited.
