Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if we can select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from two sets (converted from lists `a` and `b`) such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the selected elements.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - We need to count how many numbers from 1 to \( k \) are present in both sets (`a` and `b`).
   - We also need to count how many numbers from 1 to \( k \) are present only in `a` and only in `b`.
   - If the sum of these two counts equals \( \frac{k}{2} \), then it's possible to select the required elements.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code correctly converts the input lists `a` and `b` into frozensets, which allows for efficient membership testing.
   - It iterates through the range from 1 to \( k \) and counts the occurrences of each number in both sets and only in one of the sets.
   - After counting, it checks if the sum of numbers present only in `a` and only in `b` equals \( \frac{k}{2} \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where a number is present in both sets by incrementing `leftOnes`.
   - It handles the case where a number is present only in `a` or only in `b` by incrementing `aOnes` or `bOnes` respectively.
   - The logic ensures that if there are enough numbers in either set to cover the required half of \( k \), it will print 'yes'.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints 'yes' or 'no' based on the condition checked.

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
