To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions under which the loop continues.

The loop condition is `i <= k`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `leftOnes` is 2 if `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, otherwise `leftOnes` is 1.
- `aOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in `a`.
- `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in `b`.
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `m` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user.
- `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `i` is increased by 1.
- `t` is 1.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`. Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to adjust `k` such that `i <= k` still holds true.

Given that `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now `k - 1` (since `i` was `k - 2` before the increase).

To ensure `i <= k` in the next iteration, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, which means `k` must be greater than or equal to `k - 1 + 1 = k`.

Therefore, `k` must remain the same or be increased by at least 1 to ensure the loop continues.

State: **`leftOnes` is 2 if `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, otherwise `leftOnes` is 1; `aOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in `a`; `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in `b`; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `m` is the second integer entered by the user; `k` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user; `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is increased by 1; `t` is 1.**
