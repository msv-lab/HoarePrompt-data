Postcondition: `i` is 0, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are each either 0 or any integer up to `newk`, the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + k`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the same as when the loop started, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `bOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.
