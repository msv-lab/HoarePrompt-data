Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, m, k, a (a set of n integers), and b (a set of m integers). For each test case, it counts the number of integers present in both sets a and b within the range [1, k], the number of integers present only in set a, and the number of integers present only in set b within the same range. It then checks if the counts of integers present only in set a and only in set b are equal to half of k. If both counts match, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the result for each test case.**
