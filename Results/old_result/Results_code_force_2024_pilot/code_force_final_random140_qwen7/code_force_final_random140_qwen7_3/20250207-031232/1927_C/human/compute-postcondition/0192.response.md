Postcondition: `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `aOnes` is either 0, 1, or 0 (depending on whether `i` is in `a`), `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 0 (depending on whether `i` is in `b`), the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in both sets `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is set to 1, `i` is set to 2, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0. Otherwise, `leftOnes` is set to 0, `i` is set to 1, and either `aOnes` or `bOnes` is incremented by 1 depending on which set `i` is in, or the loop or if statement is exited.
