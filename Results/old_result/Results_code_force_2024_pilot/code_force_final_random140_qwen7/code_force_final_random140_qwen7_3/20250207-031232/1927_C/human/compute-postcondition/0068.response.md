Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < leftOnes`.
2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `leftOnes` must be greater than 2.
   - If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is set to `leftOnes` + 1.
   - Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `leftOnes`.
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `leftOnes` before the increment.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `leftOnes` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Given that `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the current iteration, `i` must be less than `leftOnes - 1` at the end of the current iteration to ensure it becomes less than `leftOnes` after the increment.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `leftOnes`. It must remain greater than 2, but we need to ensure that `i` is less than `leftOnes` at the start of the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 2 and `i` must be less than `leftOnes`**
