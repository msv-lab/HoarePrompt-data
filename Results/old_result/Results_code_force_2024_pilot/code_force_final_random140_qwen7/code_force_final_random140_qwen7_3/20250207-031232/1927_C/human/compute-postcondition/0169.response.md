Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `i` is equal to 0, `aOnes` is equal to 0, `bOnes` is 0, the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The line `bOnes = 0` sets the variable `bOnes` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
