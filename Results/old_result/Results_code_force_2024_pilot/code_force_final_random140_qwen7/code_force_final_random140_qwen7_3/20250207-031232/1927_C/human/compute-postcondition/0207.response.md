Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i <= k`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `leftOnes` is either 2, 1, or 0.
   - `i` is either 3 or 4.
   - `aOnes` and `bOnes` are either 0 or 1.
   - `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false.
   - `t` is `t + 1`.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 3.
   - `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input.
   - `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input.
   - `newk` is `k // 2`.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - `i` is either 3 or 4.
   - `k` must be at least 3.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.
   - Since `i` is either 3 or 4, `k` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `k` is at least 4 to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`leftOnes` is either 2, 1, or 0, `i` is either 3 or 4, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are either 0 or 1, `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2**.
