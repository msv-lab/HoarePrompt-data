Postcondition: `leftOnes` is 1, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` must be at least 3, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in `a`, `aOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is not in `a`, `bOnes` is set to 1 if `i` is in `b`; otherwise, no change is made to `bOnes`.
