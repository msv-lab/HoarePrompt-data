Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `newk = k // 2` assigns the value of `k // 2` to the variable `newk`. The values of `leftOnes`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` remain unchanged. The new variable `newk` is introduced with the value of `k` divided by 2 using integer division (`//`).
