Based on the initial state provided:

- `leftOnes` is exactly 5.
- `n` and `m` are integers entered by the user.
- `k` is an integer that is at least 9.
- `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user.
- `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using `map` and `input` split.
- `aOnes` is either 7 or 6.
- `bOnes` is either 0 or 1.
- `newk` is `k // 2`, so it will be `k` divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer.
- `i` is 6.
- The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
