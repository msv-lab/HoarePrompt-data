Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < leftOnes`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `leftOnes` must be greater than 0.
3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < leftOnes` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 1. Therefore, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1 to satisfy the condition `i < leftOnes`.

Given the current state, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `leftOnes` must be greater than 1.

**State: **`i` is 1, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1**
