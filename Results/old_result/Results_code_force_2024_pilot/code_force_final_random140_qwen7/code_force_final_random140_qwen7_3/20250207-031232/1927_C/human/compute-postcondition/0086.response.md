Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is either 7 or 6, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 6, `t` is 1, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split.**

Explanation: The line `leftOnes = 0` sets the value of `leftOnes` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
