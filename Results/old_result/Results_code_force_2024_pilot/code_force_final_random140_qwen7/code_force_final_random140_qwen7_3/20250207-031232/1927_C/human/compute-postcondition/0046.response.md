Postcondition: **`leftOnes` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` must be at least 5, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using `map` and `input` split, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
