Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split.**

Explanation: The code `i = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The initial values of `leftOnes`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, `t`, and `b` are preserved.
