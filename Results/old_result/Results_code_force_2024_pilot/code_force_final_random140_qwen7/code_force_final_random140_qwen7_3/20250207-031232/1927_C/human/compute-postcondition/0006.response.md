Output State: **`leftOnes` is 0, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `bOnes = 0` initializes the variable `bOnes` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
