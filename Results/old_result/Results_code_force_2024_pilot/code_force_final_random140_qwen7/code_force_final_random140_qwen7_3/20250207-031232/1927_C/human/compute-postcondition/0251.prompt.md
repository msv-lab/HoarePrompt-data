Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5; k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m); a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6; the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    leftOnes = 0
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            leftOnes += 1
        elif i in a:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    i = 0
    while i < leftOnes:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `leftOnes` must be exactly 5, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer that is at least 9, `a` is a frozenset containing integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from integers entered by the user after converting them to integers using map and input split, `aOnes` is either 7 or 6, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 6. If `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true, then the function does nothing. If `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is false, then `aOnes` will increment by 1 if it is less than `bOnes`, and `bOnes` will increment by 1 if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `aOnes` is equal to `leftOnes` if `aOnes` was initially 0 and `aOnes` was always less than or equal to `bOnes` throughout the loop, otherwise `bOnes` is equal to `leftOnes`. The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is a non-negative integer, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are each either 0 or any integer up to `newk`, the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + k * leftOnes`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the same as when the loop started, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
