Output State: **`leftOnes` is either 2, 1, or 0, `i` is either 3 or 4, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are either 0 or 1, `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is either true or false, `t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be such that `k` is at least 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states.
