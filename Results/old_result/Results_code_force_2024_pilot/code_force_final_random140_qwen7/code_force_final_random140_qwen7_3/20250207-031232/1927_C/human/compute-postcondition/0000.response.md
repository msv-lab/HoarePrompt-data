Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t`.
2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Since `t` is initialized to a value within this range, it will always be greater than 0 at the start of the loop.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `t` is already within the specified range, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

However, since the loop body is omitted, we should also consider if there are any other states that might affect the loop's execution. In this case, the loop body being omitted means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, which is guaranteed by the given range of `t`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be considered is `t`, and it must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
