Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is an input string from the user for each iteration of the loop, and `b` is set based on the count of '1' in `s` for each iteration. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `b` is set to 'Triangle' for that particular iteration. Otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square' for that particular iteration. The final value of `b` will be 'Triangle' if there was at least one iteration where `s.count('1')` was exactly 1, otherwise, it will be 'Square' if there was at least one iteration where `s.count('1')` was greater than 1. The variable `a` retains its last assigned value, which could be 'Triangle' if any string `s` contained exactly one '1', or it remains 0 if no such string was encountered.**
