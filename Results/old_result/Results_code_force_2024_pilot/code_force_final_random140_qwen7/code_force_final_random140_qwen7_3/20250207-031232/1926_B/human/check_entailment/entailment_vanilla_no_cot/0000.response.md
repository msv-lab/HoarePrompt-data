Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle and Square Identification**:
   - The program checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes a triangle. This logic is flawed because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1', as long as they align vertically.
   - Similarly, the program checks if any row contains more than one '1' and assumes a square. This is also incorrect because a square can have rows with only one '1' if those '1's are aligned horizontally.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The variable `a` is set to 'Triangle' if any row has exactly one '1', but this doesn't guarantee a triangle. A triangle could have multiple rows with more than one '1'.
   - The variable `b` is set to 'Square' if any row has more than one '1', but this doesn't guarantee a square. A square could have rows with only one '1' if those '1's are aligned horizontally.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check the structure of the grid to ensure it matches either a triangle or a square pattern. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n):
        ones_count = sum(row[i] == '1' for row in grid)
        if ones_count == 0:
            continue
        if ones_count % 2 == 0:
            return False
        if ones_count > 2 * i + 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n):
        if grid[i].count('1') != n // 2 + 1:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")

func()
```

This corrected version checks the grid to ensure it follows the rules for a triangle or a square.
