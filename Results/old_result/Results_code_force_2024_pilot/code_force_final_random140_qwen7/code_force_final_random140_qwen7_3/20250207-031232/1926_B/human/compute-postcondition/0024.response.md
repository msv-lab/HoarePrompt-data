Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `j` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1. Otherwise, `a` is 'Square'.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is an input string (no change needed here).
   - `j` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `a` is determined based on the count of '1' in `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `j` and `n`, we need to update these variables.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `s` remains the same input string.
   - `j` is now 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `a` remains 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1. Otherwise, it remains 'Square'.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `j` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1. Otherwise, `a` is 'Square'.**
