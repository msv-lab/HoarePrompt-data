Postcondition: `i` is `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', `j` is 1, and `s` is the input string. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `a` and `b`.
