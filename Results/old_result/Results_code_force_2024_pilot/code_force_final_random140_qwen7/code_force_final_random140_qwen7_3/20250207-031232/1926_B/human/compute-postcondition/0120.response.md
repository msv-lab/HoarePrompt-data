Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a grid represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n binary characters ('0' or '1'). For each test case, it determines whether the grid contains a triangle or a square that includes all '1's and has a size greater than 1. If any row contains exactly one '1', it identifies the shape as a triangle; otherwise, it identifies the shape as a square. The function prints 'Triangle' if a triangle is found, and 'Square' if no triangle is found but a square is identified.**
