Postcondition: `i` is `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 2, and `s` is the input string. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then no changes are made to the variables.
