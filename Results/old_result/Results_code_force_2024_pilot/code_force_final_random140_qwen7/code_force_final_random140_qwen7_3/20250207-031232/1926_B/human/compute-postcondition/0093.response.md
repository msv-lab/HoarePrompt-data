Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `t`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0
   - `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'
   - `j` is 0
   - `s` is a string where the count of '1's is exactly 1 if `a` is 'Triangle', and the count of '1's is greater than 1 if `a` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `j < n`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `j`).
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` remains `t`
   - `n` remains greater than 0
   - `a` remains either 'Triangle' or 0
   - `b` remains either an empty string or 'Square'
   - `j` becomes 1
   - `s` remains the same as its current state (the count of '1's in `s` will still be exactly 1 if `a` is 'Triangle', and greater than 1 if `a` is 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', `j` is 1, and `s` is a string where the count of '1's is exactly 1 if `a` is 'Triangle', and the count of '1's is greater than 1 if `a` is 0.**
