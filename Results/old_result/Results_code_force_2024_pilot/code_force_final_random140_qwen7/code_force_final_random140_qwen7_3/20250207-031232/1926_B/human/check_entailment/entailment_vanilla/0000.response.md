### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires identifying whether the `1`s in a given grid form a triangle or a square.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and the grid itself.
   - It then iterates through each row of the grid.
   - If a row contains exactly one `1`, it sets `a` to 'Triangle'.
   - If a row contains more than one `1`, it sets `b` to 'Square'.
   - After processing all rows, it prints either 'Triangle' or 'Square' based on the values of `a` and `b`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic to identify a triangle or a square is flawed:
     - **Triangle Identification**: The program checks if any row has exactly one `1`. This is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one `1`.
     - **Square Identification**: The program checks if any row has more than one `1`. This is also incorrect because a square can have rows with only one `1` if the `1`s are not aligned properly.
   - The program does not correctly check the pattern required for a triangle or a square.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly identify the patterns required for a triangle or a square based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**False**
