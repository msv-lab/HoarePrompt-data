Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and is set to the input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100` remains valid after the code execution, as the input is constrained to this range.
