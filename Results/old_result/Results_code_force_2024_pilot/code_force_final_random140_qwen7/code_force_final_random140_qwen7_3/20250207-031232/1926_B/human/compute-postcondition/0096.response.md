Output State: **`i` is `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 1, and `s` is the input string.**

The code snippet `b = 'Square'` changes the value of `b` from its previous state (either an empty string or 'Square') to 'Square'. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
