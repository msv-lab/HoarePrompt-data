Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `s` is an input string from the user. If `s.count('1')` is greater than 1, then `b` is set to 'Square'. If `s.count('1')` is not greater than 1, the values of `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged, and `b` retains its original value (which is not specified in the else part).
