Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - The count of '1' in `s` is either exactly 1, in which case `a` is 'Triangle', or greater than 1, in which case `b` is 'Square'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be equal to the number of iterations completed so far.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `n` remains the same because it is the upper limit of the range.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so if it was `k` before, it will become `k + 1`.
   - The values of `s`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1, if `j` was previously `k`, then for the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

**Final State**:
- `n` remains the same (greater than 0).
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `s`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `j` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, otherwise `b` is 'Square'**.
