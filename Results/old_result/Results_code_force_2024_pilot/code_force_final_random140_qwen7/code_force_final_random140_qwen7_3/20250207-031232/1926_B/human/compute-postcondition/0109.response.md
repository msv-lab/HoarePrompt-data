Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 2 (or any value up to `n-1`), and `s` is the last input string. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', `b` remains 'Square'.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will still be `t`, `n` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to run, `a` will be either 'Triangle' if any input string contained exactly one '1', or it will remain 0 if no such string was found. The variable `b` will always be 'Square' because it gets assigned 'Square' on the first iteration and remains unchanged thereafter. The variable `j` will be the last index of the loop, which can be any value from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `s` will hold the last input string provided during the loop's execution.
