Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran, `n` will be greater than 0 for each iteration, `a` will be 'Triangle' if any string `s` across all iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` will be 0, and `b` will be 'Square' because it gets set to 'Square' in every iteration regardless of the value of `s`.**

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `t` will hold the total number of times the outer loop executed.
- For each inner loop iteration, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `a` will be 'Triangle' if at least one input string `s` contained exactly one '1' across all iterations; otherwise, `a` will remain 0.
- The variable `b` will always be 'Square' because it is set to 'Square' in every iteration of the inner loop, making it irrelevant whether any string `s` had more than one '1'.
