Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `j` will be equal to `n`, `a` will be 'Triangle' if any string `s` has exactly one '1', otherwise `a` will be unchanged, `b` will be 'Square' if any string `s` has more than one '1', otherwise `b` will be unchanged. The final values of `a` and `b` will reflect the cumulative conditions from all inputs provided during the loop iterations.**
