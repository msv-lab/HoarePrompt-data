Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered as input.**

The code `arr = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
