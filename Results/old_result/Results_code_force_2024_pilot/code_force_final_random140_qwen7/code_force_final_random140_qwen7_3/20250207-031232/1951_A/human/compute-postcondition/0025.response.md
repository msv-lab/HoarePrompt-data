Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered as input, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, and `count_ones` is equal to 2. If the string `'11'` is present in `arr`, `results` contains 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'no'.
