Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is the input integer entered, `arr` is the input string entered, `count_ones` is the count of '1's in `arr`. If the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing 'yes'. If the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing 'no'.
