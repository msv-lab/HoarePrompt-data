Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is the input integer entered, `arr` is the input string entered, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `arr` is updated to the input string entered.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input()` takes an input string and assigns it to the variable `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
