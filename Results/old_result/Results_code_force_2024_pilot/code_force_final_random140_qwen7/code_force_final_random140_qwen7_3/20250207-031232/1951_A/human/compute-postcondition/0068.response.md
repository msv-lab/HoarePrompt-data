Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for r in results:`. The only variable mentioned here is `r`, which iterates over the `results` list.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `r`**: Since `r` is iterating over the `results` list, the initial state of `r` will be the first element of the `results` list. Given that `results` is described as a list containing 'yes' and 'no', the initial value of `r` will be either 'yes' or 'no'.

3. **State Adjustments**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial value of `r`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `arr`) do not affect the loop's execution directly, as they are not used in the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `r`.

**State:**
**`r` is the first element of the list ['yes', 'no']**
