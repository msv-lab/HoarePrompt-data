Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered as input, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains 'no'. If `count_ones` is even, `results` contains 'yes' if `'11'` is present in `arr`, and 'no' otherwise.
