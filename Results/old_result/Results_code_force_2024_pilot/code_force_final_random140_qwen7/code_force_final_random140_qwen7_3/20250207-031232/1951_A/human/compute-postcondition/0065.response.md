Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is the integer input from the user, `arr` is the string input from the user, `count_ones` is the count of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` remains as a list containing 'yes' and 'no'. If `count_ones` is odd, `results` is set to a list containing 'no'. If `count_ones` is 2 and `'11'` is found in `arr`, `results` is set to a list containing 'no'. Otherwise, `results` remains as a list containing 'yes' and 'no'.**
