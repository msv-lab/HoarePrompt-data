The only objects in the loop head are the variables `r` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute again, the list must still have at least 2 elements remaining.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list with at least 2 elements remaining. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still have at least 2 elements remaining.

State: **`results` is a list with at least 2 elements remaining**
