Based on the initial state provided, `results` is a list with at least 2 elements remaining. However, the specific elements of the list are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the list.

Given this, the print statement will output the last element of the `results` list, as it is the only element referenced in the print statement without any indexing.

Output: **the last element of the results list**
