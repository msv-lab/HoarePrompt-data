Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is the input integer entered, `arr` is the input string entered, `count_ones` is the count of '1's in `arr`. If `'11'` is found in `arr`, `results` is updated to contain 'no'. Otherwise, `results` is updated to contain 'yes' and the original elements.**
