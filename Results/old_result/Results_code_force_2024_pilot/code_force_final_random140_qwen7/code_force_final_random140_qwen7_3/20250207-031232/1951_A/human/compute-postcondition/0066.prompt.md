Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    count_ones = arr.count('1')
    if count_ones == 0:
        results.append('yes')
    elif count_ones % 2 != 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif count_ones == 2:
        if '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        else:
            results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered as input, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` contains 'yes'. Otherwise, if `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains 'no'. If `count_ones` is even, `results` contains 'yes' if `'11'` is present in `arr`, and 'no' otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is the input integer entered, `arr` is the input string entered, `count_ones` is the count of '1's in `arr`. If the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing 'yes'. If the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is the integer input from the user, `arr` is the string input from the user, `count_ones` is the count of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` remains as a list containing 'yes' and 'no'. If `count_ones` is odd, `results` is set to a list containing 'no'. If `count_ones` is 2 and `'11'` is found in `arr`, `results` is set to a list containing 'no'. Otherwise, `results` remains as a list containing 'yes' and 'no'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
