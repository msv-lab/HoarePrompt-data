Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered as input, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` equals 2, `results` contains 'yes' if `'11'` is present in `arr`, otherwise it contains 'no'. If `count_ones` does not equal 2, `results` contains 'yes'.
