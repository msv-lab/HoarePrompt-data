Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and the previous elements, `n` is the input integer entered, `arr` is the input string entered, `count_ones` is the count of '1's in `arr`.**

The code `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
