### Reasoning:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the `func()` function is separate from the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. Since the problem statement only describes and requires the implementation of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`, the `func()` function is indeed irrelevant to the problem at hand.

2. **Functionality of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`**:
   - The function correctly iterates over all subdirectories in the current working directory.
   - It filters these directories based on their names being digits within the specified range (`start` to `end`).
   - For each filtered directory, it lists all `.html` files and generates corresponding `.py` files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`).

3. **Input and Output**:
   - The function does not rely on any external input or output mechanisms other than those specified in the problem statement.
   - It prints the number of `.html` files in each relevant directory and the paths of the generated `.py` files.
   - There are no logical errors or omissions in the implementation of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

4. **Irrelevance of `func()`**:
   - The `func()` function, while correctly implemented, is not part of the solution required by the problem statement.
   - Its presence does not affect the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

Given that the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correctly implemented according to the problem description, and the `func()` function is unrelated and does not impact the correctness of the main function, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
