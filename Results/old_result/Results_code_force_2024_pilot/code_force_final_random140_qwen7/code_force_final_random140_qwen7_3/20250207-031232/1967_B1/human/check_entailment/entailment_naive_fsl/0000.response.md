Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` using the formula `ans = ans + n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This approach does not account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To illustrate this, consider the test case `(n, m) = (10, 8)`:
- According to the problem statement, the valid pairs are:
  - (1, 1)
  - (2, 1)
  - (2, 2)
  - (3, 1)
  - (4, 1)
  - (5, 1)
  - (6, 1)
  - (6, 2)
  - (6, 3)
  - (7, 1)
  - (8, 1)
  - (9, 1)
  - (10, 1)
  - (10, 2)
  - (10, 3)
  - (10, 4)

However, the program incorrectly counts the pairs as 14 instead of 15.

The correct implementation would involve checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair `(a, b)` within the specified ranges.
