Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `ans` is `n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`
- `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list
- `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list
- `b` is an integer from the third element of the input list

### Loop Statement
```python
for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `b` starts from 1 and goes up to `min(n, m)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was one less than its current value because the loop increments `b` by 1 in each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Determine the new value of `b`:**
   - Since the loop increments `b` by 1, if `b` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then `b` will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   
2. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.

### Current Values
- Let's denote the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`.
- Therefore, `b` at the start of the next iteration will be `k + 1`.

### Updated State
- `ans` remains unchanged because it does not depend on `b`.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `b` will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

### Final State
Given that `b` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `b` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`ans` is `n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`, `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list, `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list, `b` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration.**

For simplicity, let's denote `k` as the previous value of `b`:

State: **`ans` is `n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`, `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list, `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list, `b` is `b + 1` where `b` is the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration.**

To provide a concrete example, if `b` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then `b` will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`ans` is `n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`, `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list, `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list, `b` is 4.**

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`ans` is `n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`, `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list, `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list, `b` is `b + 1` where `b` is the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration.**
