Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n // b + 1 for all b in the range from 1 to min(n, m) inclusive, with n and b taking their final values after the loop ends)**

Explanation:
- `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `b` takes the value of `min(n, m)` after the loop ends.
- The loop calculates the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.
- After the loop completes, `ans` holds the cumulative sum of these values.
- The `print` statement outputs the value of `ans`, which is the sum described above.
