Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Calculating the Answer:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through all possible values of `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
   - For each `b`, it adds `n // b + 1` to `ans`.

### Explanation of the Calculation

- The expression `n // b + 1` calculates how many multiples of `b` fit into `n` plus one additional value (since we need to count `b` itself).
- However, this calculation does not correctly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify with the example provided:

#### Test Case 1: \( n = 1, m = 1 \)
- Possible pairs: (1, 1)
- Check: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) and \( 2 \mod (1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1)) = 0 \)
- Correct answer: 1

#### Test Case 4: \( n = 10, m = 8 \)
- Possible pairs: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), (10, 2)
- Check: Each pair satisfies \( a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0 \)
- Correct answer: 14

### Correctness of the Program

The given program does not correctly implement the required logic. Specifically, it does not check whether \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Instead, it simply counts the number of multiples of `b` up to `n`, which is not sufficient to satisfy the given condition.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition \( a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0 \).

**Correctness: False**
