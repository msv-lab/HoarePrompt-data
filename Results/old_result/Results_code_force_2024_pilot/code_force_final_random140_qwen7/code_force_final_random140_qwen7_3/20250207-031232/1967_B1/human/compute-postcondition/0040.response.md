Output State: **The final value of `ans` will be the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m` for all iterations of `T` from 0 to `t-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 up to the smaller of `n` and `m`, for every value of `T` provided by the input. This means `ans` accumulates the sum of these values for each pair of `[n, m]` given by the input.
