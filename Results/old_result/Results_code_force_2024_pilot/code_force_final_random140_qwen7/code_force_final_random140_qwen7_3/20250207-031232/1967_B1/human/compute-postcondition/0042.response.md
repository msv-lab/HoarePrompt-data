Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \( n // b + 1 \) for each \( b \) in the range from 1 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). After processing all test cases, it prints the result for each test case.**
