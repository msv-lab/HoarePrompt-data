Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of \( n // b + 1 \) for each \( b \) in the range from 1 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \), which does not satisfy the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over possible values of \( a \) and \( b \) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here's how the correct approach should work:

1. For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
2. Count the number of pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy this condition.

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        
        print(ans)
```

The code calculates \( n // b + 1 \) for each \( b \) from 1 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). This is not equivalent to counting pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
