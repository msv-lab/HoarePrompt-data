You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^6, and the sum of all n and the sum of all m over all test cases do not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The final value of `ans` will be the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m` for all iterations of `T` from 0 to `t-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Calculating the Number of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
   - For each `b`, it adds `n // b + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the given code.
   - The code only checks if \(a\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and increments `ans` based on the value of `n // b + 1`.

### Checking the Condition

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be satisfied for each pair \((a, b)\). However, the given code does not check this condition at all. Instead, it simply counts the number of multiples of `b` up to `n`.

### Example Analysis

Let's analyze the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:** \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - The only valid pair is \((1, 1)\).
  - The code correctly outputs 1.

- **Test Case 4:** \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\).
  - The code correctly outputs 14.

- **Test Case 6:** \(n = 1000000\), \(m = 1145141\)
  - The code will count the number of multiples of `b` up to `n` for each `b` from 1 to 1000000.
  - This does not ensure that the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion

The given code does not correctly implement the required condition. It only counts the number of multiples of `b` up to `n` without checking the actual condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
