Output State: `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive, `n` remains unchanged, and `b` is `min(n, m)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` starting from 1 up to the minimum of `n` and `m`. The variable `n` stays the same throughout the loop, and `b` will take the final value of `min(n, m)` after the loop ends.
