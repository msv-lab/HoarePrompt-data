Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. The function verifies that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^6. Additionally, the sum of all n and the sum of all m over all test cases do not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6. Based on these constraints, the function either returns valid if the constraints are met for all test cases, or returns an error message if any constraint is violated.**
