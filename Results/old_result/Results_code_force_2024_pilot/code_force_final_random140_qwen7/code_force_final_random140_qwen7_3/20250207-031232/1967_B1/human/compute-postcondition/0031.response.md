Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `b`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop runs for values of `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.
   - For the loop to start executing, `min(n, m)` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `min(n, m)` is at least 1.
   - Since `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list and `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list, we need to check the values of `n` and `m` to ensure their minimum value is at least 1.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - The initial state is given as `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list, and `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of `n` and `m` such that `min(n, m)` is at least 1.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer from the first element of the input list, `m` is an integer from the second element of the input list, and `min(n, m)` must be at least 1.**
