Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `b` and the range condition `range(1, min(n, m) + 1)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated by the expression `ans + n // (b + 1) + 1 + n // b + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `b` is updated to `b + 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `b`**: Since `b` was updated to `b + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `b` is `b + 1`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `b` must be less than or equal to `min(n, m)`. Given that `b` is now `b + 1`, we need to ensure that `b + 1` is still within the range `1` to `min(n, m)`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `b` is updated to `b + 1`.

Since the loop condition depends on `b` being less than or equal to `min(n, m)`, we need to ensure that `b + 1` is still within this range. If `b + 1` exceeds `min(n, m)`, the loop will terminate.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `ans` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `b` is updated to `b + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is the same as before, `n` is the same as before, `b` is `b + 1`**.
