Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Calculating the Number of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
   - For each `b`, it adds `n // b + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the given code.
   - The code only checks if \(a\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and increments `ans` based on the value of `n // b + 1`.

### Checking the Condition

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be satisfied for each pair \((a, b)\). However, the given code does not check this condition at all. Instead, it simply counts the number of multiples of `b` up to `n`.

### Example Analysis

Let's analyze the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:** \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - The only valid pair is \((1, 1)\).
  - The code correctly outputs 1.

- **Test Case 4:** \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\).
  - The code correctly outputs 14.

- **Test Case 6:** \(n = 1000000\), \(m = 1145141\)
  - The code will count the number of multiples of `b` up to `n` for each `b` from 1 to 1000000.
  - This does not ensure that the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion

The given code does not correctly implement the required condition. It only counts the number of multiples of `b` up to `n` without checking the actual condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
