Output State: `ans` is `ans + n // (b + min(n, m)) + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`, `n` remains unchanged, and `b` is `min(n, m)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `n // b + 1` for every integer `b` from 1 up to and including `min(n, m)`. The variable `n` stays the same throughout the loop, and `b` starts from 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `min(n, m)`.
