Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the provided problem description. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `nums`.

2. **Prefix Sum and Count of Ones**: The program calculates the prefix sums (`sum`) and the count of ones (`ones`) up to each index. This is necessary to efficiently compute the sum and count of ones within any subarray range.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program correctly computes the number of ones (`onesInRange`) and the sum (`sumInRange`) within the specified range `[l, r]`. It then checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is satisfied. This condition ensures that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that meets the given criteria.

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given that the program follows the logic accurately and handles the input and output as specified, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
