Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer - 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers separated by a space from the input, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, and `onesInRange` is updated to the value of `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.**

In this step, the code updates `onesInRange` to the value of `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
