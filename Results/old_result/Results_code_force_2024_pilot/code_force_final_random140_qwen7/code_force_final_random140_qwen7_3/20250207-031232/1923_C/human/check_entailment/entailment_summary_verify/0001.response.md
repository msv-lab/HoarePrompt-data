### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good" based on specific conditions. A subarray is good if it can be transformed into another array `b` where:
     - The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
     - No element in the subarray is the same as its corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `nums`.
   - It uses prefix sums (`ones` and `sum`) to count the number of 1s and calculate the sum up to each index.
   - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s and the sum within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - It checks if the subarray can be transformed into a good array using the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - If the condition holds, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for counting 1s and calculating sums is correct.
   - The transformation check is based on the condition derived from the problem statement.
   - The condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) is indeed a necessary condition for a subarray to be good. This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray can be split into two parts, one part being the sum of the elements that can be changed to positive values other than themselves, and the other part being the sum of the elements that remain unchanged (which must be positive).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `l == r` correctly by printing "NO".
   - The condition used in the code is sufficient to determine if a subarray is good. Specifically, if the condition holds, it means that the subarray can be transformed into a good array where no element remains unchanged and all elements in `b` are positive.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem statement. The condition used in the code is indeed correct and sufficient to determine the validity of the subarray.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
