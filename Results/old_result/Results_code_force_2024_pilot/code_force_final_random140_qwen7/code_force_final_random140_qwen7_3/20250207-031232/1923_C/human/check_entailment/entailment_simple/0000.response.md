Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
2. The annotated program correctly initializes variables and processes the input as required.
3. The logic within the function `func_1()` checks if a subarray is good by calculating the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).
4. The condition for a subarray to be good is checked using the formula `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`. This simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`, which ensures that the sum of the subarray can be redistributed while maintaining the conditions of having distinct values and positive values.
5. The program handles edge cases where `l == r` by printing 'NO' directly.
6. The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem requirements and constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
