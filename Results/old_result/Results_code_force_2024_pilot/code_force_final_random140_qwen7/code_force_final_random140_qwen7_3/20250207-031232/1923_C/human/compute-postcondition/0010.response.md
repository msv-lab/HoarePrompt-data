Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `ones` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each element is `0`.
   - `i` is `6`.
   - `sum[6]` is `sum[5] + nums[5]`.
   - `ones[5]` is `ones[4] + (1 if nums[4] == 1 else 0)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `6`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented to `7` for the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `q` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `nums` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `ones` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `sum` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` is updated to `7`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0, `i` is 7**
