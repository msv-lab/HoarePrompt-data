The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop context, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop (if there was one).**
