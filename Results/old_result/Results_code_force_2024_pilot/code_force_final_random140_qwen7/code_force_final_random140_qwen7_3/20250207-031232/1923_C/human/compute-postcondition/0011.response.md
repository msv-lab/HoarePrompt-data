Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0, `i` is 8, `ones[7]` is `ones[6]` + (1 if `nums[6]` == 1 else 0)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ones[i]` to be `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`. Given that initially `i` is 7, after executing the line of code, `i` becomes 8. The value of `ones[7]` is set to the value of `ones[6]` plus 1 if `nums[6]` is 1, or 0 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
