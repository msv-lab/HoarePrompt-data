Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers initialized to zero.
- `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers initialized to zero.
- `i` is set to `n+1`.
- `sum[n]` is calculated as `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`.
- `ones[n-1]` is calculated as `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `r` is an input integer, and currently, `l` is equal to `r`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
