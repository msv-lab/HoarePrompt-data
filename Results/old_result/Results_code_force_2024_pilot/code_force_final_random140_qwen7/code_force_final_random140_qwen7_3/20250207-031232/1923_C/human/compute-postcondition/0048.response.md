Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` and `r` are undefined, `sumInRange` and `onesInRange` are undefined.**

After the loop executes all its iterations, `q` will be reduced to 0 because the loop removes one query (`q`) with each iteration. At this point, there are no more queries left to process, so `l` and `r` will not be assigned any values, and the calculations for `sumInRange` and `onesInRange` will not be performed. The other variables remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being `n+1`, `sum[n]` being the cumulative sum of `nums`, and `ones[n-1]` being the count of `1`s in `nums`.
