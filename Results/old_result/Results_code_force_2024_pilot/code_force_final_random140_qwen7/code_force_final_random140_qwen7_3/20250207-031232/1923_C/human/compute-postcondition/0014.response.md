Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n+1`. The `sum` list will have its last element as the sum of all elements in the `nums` list, since it accumulates the sum of `nums[i-1]` at each iteration. Similarly, the `ones` list will have its last element as the count of `1`s in the `nums` list up to the last index, since it increments by 1 whenever `nums[i-1]` is `1`.
