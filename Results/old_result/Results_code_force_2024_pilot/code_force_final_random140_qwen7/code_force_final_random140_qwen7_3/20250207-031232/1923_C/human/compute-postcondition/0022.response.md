Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers initialized to zero, `i` is n+1, `sum[n]` is `sum[n-1] + nums[n-1]`, `ones[n-1]` is `ones[n-2] + (1 if nums[n-2] == 1 else 0)`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The code calculates `sumInRange` which is the difference between `sum[r]` and `sum[l - 1]`. Similarly, it calculates `onesInRange` which is the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
