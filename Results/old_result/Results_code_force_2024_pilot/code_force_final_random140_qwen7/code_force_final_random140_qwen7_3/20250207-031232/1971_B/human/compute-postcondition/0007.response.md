Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0; `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `m` is the first character of `string`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first character of the `string` to the variable `m`. The length of the `string` is not checked in this snippet, so the value of `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged. The `string` itself is not modified, only `m` is assigned the first character of `string`.
