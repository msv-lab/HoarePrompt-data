Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt_test_cases` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
    string = input().strip()
    if len(string) == 1:
        print('No')
    m = string[0]
    k = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == m:
            k += 1
    if k == len(string):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
        print(''.join(sorted(string)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to the length of `string`, and `k` is equal to the number of times `m` appears in `string`. If `k` equals the length of `string`, then `m` appears as many times as the length of the string. Otherwise, `k` does not equal the length of `string`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `string` is a string, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `m` is a character, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string `string`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After executing the if-else block, `string` remains the same as the initial input string, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string`. If `k` equals the length of `string`, the function does nothing additional. Otherwise, `k` is simply the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
