Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `i` and `string`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(string) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `string` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within the string.
   - `m` is a character.
   - `k` is increased by 1 if `string[i]` equals `m`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze what happens in the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `string[i]` will be checked against `m`.
   - If `string[i]` equals `m`, `k` will be increased by 1; otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `string` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `k` will either be `k + 1` or remain `k` depending on the value of `string[i + 1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `string` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `k` remains unchanged unless `string[i + 1]` equals `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`string` is a string, `i` is an index within the string (i + 1), `m` is a character, and `k` is increased by 1 if `string[i + 1]` equals `m`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
