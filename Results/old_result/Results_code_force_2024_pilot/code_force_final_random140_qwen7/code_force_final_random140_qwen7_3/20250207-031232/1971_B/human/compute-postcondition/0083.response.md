Output State: The loop will have executed `cnt_test_cases` times. For each input string, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string, `m` will be the first character of the string, and `k` will be the total number of occurrences of `m` in the string. If `k` equals the length of the string, the program prints 'No' and moves on to the next test case. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string, and then moves on to the next test case.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, followed by the sorted version of the string if applicable. The final state of the variables within the loop (like `i`, `m`, and `k`) will reflect the last string processed, but the overall output will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses for each input string, with sorted strings printed when appropriate.
