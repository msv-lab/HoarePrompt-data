Output State: **`string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is length_of_string + 1, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `k` to 0, which overrides its previous value based on the length of `string` and the count of the first character `m` in `string`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
