Output State: **`string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is length_of_string + 1, `m` is a character, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string `string`.**

Explanation: The code replaces the current value of `string` with the input string provided by the user, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `i`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
