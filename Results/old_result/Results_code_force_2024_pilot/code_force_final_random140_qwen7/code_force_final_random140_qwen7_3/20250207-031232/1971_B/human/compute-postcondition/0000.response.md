Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_test_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cnt_test_cases`. The initial conditions for `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
