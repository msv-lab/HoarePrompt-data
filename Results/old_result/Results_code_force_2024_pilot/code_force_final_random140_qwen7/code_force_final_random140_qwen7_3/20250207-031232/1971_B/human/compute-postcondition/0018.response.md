Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` in the range function `range(len(string))`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the string (`len(string)`).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is 2 (though `k` is not directly involved in the loop condition)
   - The postcondition mentions that if `string[1]` equals `m`, then `i` is 1 and `k` is 2.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(string)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `i` becomes 2 (because `len(string)` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `k` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the updated state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 2**
