Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `string` and `k` is equal to the number of times `m` appears in `string`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string because the loop increments `i` from 0 to one less than the length of the string. The variable `k` will count the number of times the first character `m` appears in the string `string`.
