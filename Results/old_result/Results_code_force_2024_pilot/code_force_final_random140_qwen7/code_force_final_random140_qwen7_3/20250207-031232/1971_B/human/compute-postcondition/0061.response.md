Postcondition: **`string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is length_of_string + 1, `m` is a character, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string `string`. If the length of `string` is 1, then `k` is either 0 (if `string` is not equal to `m`) or 1 (if `string` is equal to `m`).**
