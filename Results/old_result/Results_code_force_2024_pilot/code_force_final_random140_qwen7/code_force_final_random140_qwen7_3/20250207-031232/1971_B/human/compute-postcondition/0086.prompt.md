You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        
        m = string[0]
        
        k = 0
        
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed `cnt_test_cases` times. For each input string, the variable `m` will be set to the first character of the string, `k` will be the count of how many times `m` appears in the string, and `i` will be the length of the string. If `k` equals the length of the string, the program will print 'No' and move on to the next test case. Otherwise, it will print 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string. After all iterations, the final output will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, followed by the sorted string if applicable.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the output will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case based on whether the entire string is composed of the same character. If 'Yes', the string will be printed in sorted order. The loop will have processed all `cnt_test_cases` inputs, and the final output will reflect the results of each case according to the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function returns a result based on the conditions defined for `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
