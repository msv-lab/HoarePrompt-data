Reasoning:
- The provided function correctly handles the first condition where if the string consists of only one unique character, it should print 'No'.
- However, the function fails to handle the case where the string has more than one unique character but cannot be rearranged into a different string. For example, the string "aaa" cannot be rearranged into a different string because all characters are the same.
- The function always sorts the string and prints it when it should only do so if the string can be rearranged into a different string. Sorting the string does not guarantee that a different string can be formed, especially for strings with all characters being the same.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function incorrectly prints "Yes" followed by the sorted version of the string for cases where the string cannot be rearranged into a different string. This violates the requirement to either print "Yes" followed by a different rearrangement or "No" if no such rearrangement is possible.
