The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (the number of test cases) and a string `s` (of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains more than one distinct character. If `s` consists of only one character repeated throughout, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string `s`. After processing all test cases, it outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each case, and the sorted string if applicable.
