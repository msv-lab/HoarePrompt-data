Output State: **`string` is a string, `i` is an index within the string (i + 2), `m` is a character, `k` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. The other variables (`string`, `i`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated state of `k` is simply increased by 1 compared to its initial state.
