Output State: **`i` is length_of_string + 1, `cnt_test_cases` is the same as before, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code reads a string from the input using `input()` and then strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `.strip()`. The variable `i` retains its original value which is `length_of_string + 1`, and `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged. The new variable `string` is assigned the stripped input string.
