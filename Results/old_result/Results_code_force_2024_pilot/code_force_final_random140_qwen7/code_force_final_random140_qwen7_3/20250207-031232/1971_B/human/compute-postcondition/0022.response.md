Output State: `i` is equal to the length of the string, `k` is equal to the number of times the character `m` appears in the string.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will iterate through each index of the string. If the character at each index matches `m`, the counter `k` will increment. Therefore, `i` will eventually reach the length of the string, and `k` will hold the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string.
