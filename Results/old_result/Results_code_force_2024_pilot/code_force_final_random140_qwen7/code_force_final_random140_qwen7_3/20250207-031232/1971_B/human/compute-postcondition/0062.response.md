Output State: **`string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is length_of_string + 1, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string `string`. If the length of `string` is 1, then `k` is either 0 (if `string` is not equal to `m`) or 1 (if `string` is equal to `m`).**

Explanation: The code `m = string[0]` assigns the first character of the string to the variable `m`. The length of the string remains unchanged, so `i` is still `length_of_string + 1`. The value of `k` depends on whether the first character of the string matches the entire string. If the length of `string` is 1, then `k` is either 0 (if `string` is not equal to `m`) or 1 (if `string` is equal to `m`). All other variables remain in their initial state.
