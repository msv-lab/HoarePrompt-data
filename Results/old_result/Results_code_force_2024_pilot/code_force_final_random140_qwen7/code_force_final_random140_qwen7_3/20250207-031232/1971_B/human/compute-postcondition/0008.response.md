Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0; `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `m` is the first character of `string`; `k` is 0.**

The code initializes `k` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cnt_test_cases`, `string`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
