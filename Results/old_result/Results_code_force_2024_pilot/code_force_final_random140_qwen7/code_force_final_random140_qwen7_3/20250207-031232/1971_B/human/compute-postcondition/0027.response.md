Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
- `k` is equal to the number of times `m` appears in `string`.
- The number of times `m` appears in `string` is not equal to the length of `string`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. Since there is no dependency on the values of `i` and `k` for this particular print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Yes**
