Based on the initial state provided:

- `string` is a string.
- `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
- `m` is a character.
- `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string `string`, but `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(''.join(sorted(string)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `sorted(string)` sorts the characters in the string `string` alphabetically.
2. `''.join(sorted(string))` joins these sorted characters into a single string without any separators.

Since the exact content of `string` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact printed output. However, we know that the output will be the sorted version of the string `string`.

Output: **a sorted version of the string `string`**
