Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(cnt_test_cases)`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `cnt_test_cases`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `string` is a string.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
   - `m` is a character.
   - `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string `string`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < cnt_test_cases`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cnt_test_cases`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `string` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `length_of_string + 1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

Based on these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`string` is a string, `i` is length_of_string + 1, `m` is a character, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string `string`.**
