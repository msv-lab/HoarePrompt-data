Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 0
- `k` is 1 if `string[i]` equals `m`. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(string)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each index of the string `string`.
- The variable `i` is the loop variable and is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The variable `k` is set based on the condition `string[i] == m`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Values**: At the start of the loop, `i` is 0.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition `string[i] == m` is checked.
   - If `string[0] == m`, then `k` is set to 1.
   - If `string[0] != m`, then `k` remains unchanged (which is 1 from the previous iteration).
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
4. **New Condition Check**: The condition `string[1] == m` is checked.
   - If `string[1] == m`, then `k` is set to 1.
   - If `string[1] != m`, then `k` remains unchanged (which is 1 from the previous iteration).

### Adjusted States
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `k` will remain 1 unless `string[1] == m`, but since we don't know the value of `string[1]`, we assume it remains 1.

### Final State
State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 1**
