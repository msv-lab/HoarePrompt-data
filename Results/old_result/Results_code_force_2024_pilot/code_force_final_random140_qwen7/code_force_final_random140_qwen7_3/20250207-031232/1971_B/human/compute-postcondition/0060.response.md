Output: **No**

Explanation:
- `string` is an input string with any leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `i` is defined as `length_of_string + 1`, where `length_of_string` is the number of characters in the stripped `string`. Therefore, `i` is one more than the length of the `string`.
- `m` is a character, but its specific value is not provided.
- `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string `string`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`, regardless of the values of `i`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the output is **No**.
