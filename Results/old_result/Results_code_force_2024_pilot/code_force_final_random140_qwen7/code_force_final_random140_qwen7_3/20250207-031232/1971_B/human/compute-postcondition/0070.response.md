Output State: **`string` is a string, `i` is an index within the string (one more than the previous value), `m` is a character, `k` is increased by 1**.

The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `k` is increased by 1 if `string[i]` equals `m`, and now the code simply increments `k` regardless of the condition, `k` is increased by 1. All other variables (`string`, `i`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
