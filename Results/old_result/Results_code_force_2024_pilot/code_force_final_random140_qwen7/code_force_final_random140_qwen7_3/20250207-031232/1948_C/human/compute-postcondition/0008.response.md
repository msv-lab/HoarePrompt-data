Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the conditions remain as per the precondition.
