### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program iterates over odd indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2.
   - It checks if the conditions `a[i] == '<' and b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<' and b[i-1] == '<'` are true.
   - If either condition is true for any odd index `i`, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).

3. **Final Output**:
   - If none of the conditions are met for any odd index `i`, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can potentially reach the cell (2, n).

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The logic checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row at any odd index `i`. If the robot encounters an arrow pointing left (`<`) in the first row and the corresponding cell in the second row also has an arrow pointing left, the robot would get stuck and unable to proceed further.
- The program correctly identifies such problematic configurations and immediately returns 'NO'.
- If no such configuration exists, it correctly concludes that the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) and prints 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
