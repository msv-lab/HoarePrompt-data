Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate over a range starting from 1 up to `n` (exclusive) with a step of 2.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` is described as "the last odd number processed in the loop." Since the loop starts at 1 and increments by 2, the first value of `i` in the next iteration would be 1. Therefore, `i` should be set to 1 before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: The variable `n` is not explicitly given an initial state. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts at 1 and increments by 2. If `n` were 1 or less, the loop would not execute.

4. **Other variables**: The variables `a` and `b` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution. The variable `j` is also not part of the loop head and its initial state is irrelevant to the loop's execution.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
