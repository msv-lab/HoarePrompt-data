Output State: **The final output will be 'YES' if for no odd index \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i < n\)) the conditions \(a[i] == '<' \) and \(b[i+1] == '<'\) or \(a[i] == '<' \) and \(b[i-1] == '<'\) are true. Otherwise, the final output will be 'NO'.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, if there is no instance where the specified conditions are met for any odd index \(i\) in the range \(1\) to \(n-1\), the loop will conclude by printing 'YES'. Conversely, if at any point during the loop's execution, one of these conditions is satisfied, the loop will break and print 'NO', terminating further iterations.
