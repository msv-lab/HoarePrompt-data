Output State: The loop will execute completely without breaking if, for every pair of consecutive odd indices `i` and `i+2` (where `i` and `i+2` are within the bounds of `n`), the following conditions are met: `a[i]` is not `<` or `b[i+1]` is not `<`, and `a[i+2]` is not `<` or `b[i+1]` is not `<`. If any of these conditions fail for any such pair, the loop will break and print 'NO'. If the loop completes without breaking, it will print 'YES'.

In this final state, `j` remains 0, `i` will be the largest odd number less than `n` (or `n-1` if `n` is even), and `n` remains its original input value. The strings `a` and `b` will retain their original values throughout the loop's execution.
