Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `j` is 0.
- `i` is the next odd number after the previous value of `i`.
- The condition `i + 1 < n` must hold true.

Given this information, the print statement `print('NO')` simply outputs the string 'NO'. There are no variables or objects whose values need to be described further since the print statement does not reference any variables other than the hardcoded string 'NO'.
