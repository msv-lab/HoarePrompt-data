Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Odd Column Handling**: The solution only checks every other column starting from index 1 (i.e., columns 1, 3, 5, etc.). This means it does not handle the movement correctly for odd-indexed columns, which can significantly affect the robot's path.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The solution does not properly handle the robot moving from one row to the next and following the arrows. It only checks if the arrows point left or right in specific configurations, which is insufficient for determining if the robot can reach the target cell.

3. **Break Condition**: The `break` statement is used to prematurely exit the loop when a condition is met, but this logic is flawed and does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step, ensuring it follows the arrows and reaches the target cell. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        row = 1
        col = 1
        
        while True:
            if row == 2 and col == n:
                print('YES')
                break
            
            if col % 2 == 1:  # Odd column
                if a[col - 1] == '<':
                    row, col = row, col - 1
                elif a[col - 1] == '>':
                    row, col = row, col + 1
            else:  # Even column
                if b[col - 1] == '<':
                    row, col = row, col - 1
                elif b[col - 1] == '>':
                    row, col = row, col + 1
            
            if col < 1 or col > n:
                print('NO')
                break

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the robot's movement through the grid, ensuring it follows the arrows and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
