Output State: `n` must be less than or equal to the last odd number less than the initial value of `n`, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is the last odd number processed in the loop. If for any `i` in the range (1, n, 2), the condition `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'` is met, then the loop will break and print 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met for all iterations, the loop will print 'YES'.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, if there exists an `i` where the specified condition is true, the final output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, if no such `i` exists, the final output will be 'YES'.
