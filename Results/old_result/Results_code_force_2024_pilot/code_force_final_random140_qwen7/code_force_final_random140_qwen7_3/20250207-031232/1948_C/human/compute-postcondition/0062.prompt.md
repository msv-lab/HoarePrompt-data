Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('NO')
            break
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `n` must be less than or equal to the last odd number less than the initial value of `n`, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is the last odd number processed in the loop. If for any `i` in the range (1, n, 2), the condition `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'` is met, then the loop will break and print 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met for all iterations, the loop will print 'YES'.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, if there exists an `i` where the specified condition is true, the final output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, if no such `i` exists, the final output will be 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now the largest odd number less than `n`. The value of `n` is greater than the final value of `i` (which is the largest odd number less than `n`). The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state. If the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was met for any `i` during the loop's execution, the loop would have broken and printed 'NO'. If the loop completed without breaking, it would have printed 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `j` remains 0, `i` reaches the last odd number less than `n`, and `n` remains greater than or equal to 1. If the condition in the if statement is true at any point during the loop's execution, the loop breaks and prints 'NO'. If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'YES'.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, if the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never met for any `i` within the specified range, the final output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, if the condition was met at any point, the output will be 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
