Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j` or `i`. It only causes the loop or conditional block it is inside to terminate. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it is the most internal one. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
