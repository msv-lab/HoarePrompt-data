Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The annotated program attempts to solve this by finding a common factor that can be used to scale down the bets while maintaining the required condition.

2. **Key Steps in the Program**:
   - **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - **Bet Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which represents the minimum amount that would need to be bet if all multipliers were applied directly.
   - **Scaling Down Bets**: It then divides this product by each multiplier to get a scaled-down version of the bets (`c`), ensuring that the total bet is minimized.
   - **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the scaled-down bets.
   - **Final Bet Calculation**: Each bet is divided by the GCD to further reduce the total bet while preserving the relative ratios.
   - **Validation and Output**: If the sum of the scaled-down bets is still greater than or equal to the product, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the scaled-down bets.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **GCD Calculation**: The GCD calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are scaled down to their simplest form.
   - **Sum Check**: The check to ensure the sum of the bets is less than the product is correctly implemented.
   - **Output Format**: The program outputs the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and implementation are correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
