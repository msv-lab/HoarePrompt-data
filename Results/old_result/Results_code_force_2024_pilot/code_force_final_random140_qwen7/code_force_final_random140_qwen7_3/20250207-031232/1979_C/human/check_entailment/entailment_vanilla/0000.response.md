Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\), and the total bet should be less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for every \(i\).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`).
   - It then computes a distribution of bets (`c`) such that the sum of these bets is equal to `m` divided by each individual multiplier.
   - The `func_1` function is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list of bets to ensure the bets are in their simplest form.
   - After simplifying the bets using the GCD, the code checks if the sum of the simplified bets is still greater than or equal to `m`. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the simplified bets.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic for calculating the initial bets and simplifying them using the GCD is sound.
   - The check at the end to ensure the sum of the bets is less than `m` is correct.
   - The approach ensures that if a solution exists, it will find a valid distribution of bets.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
