Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over `numbers[1:]`, which means the loop variable `num` will take values from the second element onwards of the list `numbers`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - The loop starts with `num` being the second element of the list `numbers`.
   - The variable `hcf` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `hcf` is the first element of the list `numbers`, so it remains unchanged.
   - The list `numbers` must contain at least two elements for the loop to execute. The first element is already assigned to `hcf`, and the second element will be the first value of `num` in the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `numbers` must have at least two elements, and `num` will be the second element of the list `numbers`.

**State:**
- `hcf` is equal to the first element of the list `numbers`.
- `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
- `num` is the second element of the list `numbers`.

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`hcf` is equal to the first element of the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element of the list `numbers`**.
