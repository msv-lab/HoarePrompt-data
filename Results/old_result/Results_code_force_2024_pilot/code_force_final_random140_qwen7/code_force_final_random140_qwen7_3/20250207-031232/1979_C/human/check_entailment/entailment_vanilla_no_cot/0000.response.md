Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k_i`. However, the problem requires that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. Simply multiplying all `k_i` together does not ensure this condition.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`. However, it should be used to find the GCD of the original list `k` to scale down the values appropriately. Instead, it is being called with the list `c`, which may not yield the expected results.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Checking and Printing Results:**
   - The logic for checking if the sum of bets is less than `m` and printing the results is flawed. The program should use the GCD of the original `k` values to scale down the bets, ensuring the sum of the scaled-down bets is less than the corresponding `k_i`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the GCD of all k_i
    hcf = k[0]
    for num in k[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
    
    # Scale down each k_i by the GCD
    scaled_k = [int(num / hcf) for num in k]
    
    # Check if the sum of scaled_k is less than the smallest k_i
    if sum(scaled_k) >= min(k):
        print(-1)
    else:
        # Print the scaled values
        print(' '.join(map(str, scaled_k)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of the scaled-down bets is strictly less than the smallest `k_i`, meeting the problem requirements.
