Reasoning:
The given program aims to solve the problem by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the multipliers and then distributing the bets in a way that ensures the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Calculating Total Multiplier Product**: For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`). This product represents the smallest possible total winnings if all bets were placed on a single outcome.
3. **Distributing Bets**: It then distributes the bets evenly across all outcomes using the GCD of the multipliers. This ensures that the total bet is minimized while still being a valid distribution.
4. **Checking Validity**: After distributing the bets, it checks if the total bet is less than the product `m`. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.
5. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for the given examples and any valid input within the constraints. There are no apparent logical errors or issues with the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
