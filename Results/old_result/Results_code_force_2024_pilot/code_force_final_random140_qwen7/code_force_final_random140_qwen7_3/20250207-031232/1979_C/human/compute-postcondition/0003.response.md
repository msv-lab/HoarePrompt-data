Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, meaning it starts from the second element of the list `numbers`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `hcf` is equal to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `hcf` and `num`.
   - `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
   - `num` is the second element of the list `numbers`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `numbers[1:]`, the next value of `num` will be the third element of the list `numbers`.
   - The variable `hcf` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, but we know its value is updated based on the gcd of `hcf` and `num` from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `hcf` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `numbers` must still be a list of integers with at least two elements.
   - `num` should now be the third element of the list `numbers`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`hcf` is equal to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `hcf` and `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `num` is the third element of the list `numbers`**
