### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - Each outcome has a multiplier \( k_i \), and the total bet should be less than \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) for every \( i \).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`).
   - It then computes a distribution of bets (`c`) such that the sum of these bets is equal to `m` divided by each individual multiplier.
   - The `func_1` function is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list of bets to ensure the bets are in their simplest form.
   - After simplifying the bets using the GCD, the code checks if the sum of the simplified bets is still greater than or equal to `m`. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the simplified bets.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic for calculating the initial bets and simplifying them using the GCD is sound.
   - The check at the end to ensure the sum of the bets is less than `m` is correct.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the approach used to calculate the initial bets (`c`). Specifically, the calculation of `c` assumes that the sum of the bets will always be equal to `m` divided by each individual multiplier, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach should ensure that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than `m`.

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Let's consider the example from the problem statement:
     - Test Case 1: \( n = 3 \), \( k = [3, 2, 7] \)
     - The product \( m = 3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42 \)
     - Initial bets \( c = [14, 21, 6] \) (since \( 42 / 3 = 14 \), \( 42 / 2 = 21 \), \( 42 / 7 = 6 \))
     - Simplified bets using GCD: \( c = [14, 21, 6] \) (GCD is 1, so no further simplification is needed)
     - Sum of simplified bets: \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \), which is less than 42, so the output is correct.

   - However, consider another example:
     - Test Case 2: \( n = 2 \), \( k = [3, 3] \)
     - The product \( m = 3 \times 3 = 9 \)
     - Initial bets \( c = [3, 3] \) (since \( 9 / 3 = 3 \) for both multipliers)
     - Simplified bets using GCD: \( c = [3, 3] \) (GCD is 3, so \( c = [1, 1] \))
     - Sum of simplified bets: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is less than 9, so the output is correct.

   - The issue arises when the initial bets are not correctly calculated to ensure the sum is strictly less than `m`. The current implementation might produce invalid distributions where the sum of the bets is not strictly less than `m`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the initial bets would always be correctly calculated to ensure the sum is strictly less than `m`. The code does not guarantee this condition, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not guaranteed to produce a correct distribution of bets in all cases, as the initial bets might not be correctly calculated to ensure the sum is strictly less than `m`.
