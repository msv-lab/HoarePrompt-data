Output State: `hcf` is equal to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `hcf` and all elements in the list `numbers`; `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `hcf` will contain the greatest common divisor of all the elements in the list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the gcd of `hcf` and each subsequent element in the list `numbers`.
