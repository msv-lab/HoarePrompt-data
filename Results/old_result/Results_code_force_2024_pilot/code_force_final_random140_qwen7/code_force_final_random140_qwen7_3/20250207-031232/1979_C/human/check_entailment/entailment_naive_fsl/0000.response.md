Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_i\) and then divides this LCM by each \(k_i\) to get the bets. However, the bets should be chosen such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. 

The current implementation calculates the product of all multipliers \(m\) and then divides this product by each \(k_i\) to get the bets. This approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5 5 5
```

The program will calculate \(m = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) and then the bets will be \(c = [25, 25, 25]\). The total amount of coins bet is \(25 + 25 + 25 = 75\), which is not strictly less than 125. Therefore, this distribution of bets does not satisfy the requirement.

A correct solution would involve finding a set of bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. The current implementation does not ensure this condition is met.
