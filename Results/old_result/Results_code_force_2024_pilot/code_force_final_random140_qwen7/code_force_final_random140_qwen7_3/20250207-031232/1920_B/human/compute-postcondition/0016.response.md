Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `sums` is `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after the line `i = i + 1`, `i` becomes 3. Since `a` is a list, `a[i - 1]` corresponds to `a[2]` (which is the third element in the list), and `a[i + x - 1]` corresponds to `a[2 + x - 1]` or `a[x + 1]`. Therefore, `sums` is updated to be `a[2] - 2 * a[x + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
