Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `k` is a non-negative integer
   - `ans` contains the value of `sums` which is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` equals 0. Otherwise, `ans` is either the value of `sums` where `i + x - 1 < n`, or `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0]` with `i` remaining 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `k`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1, the new value of `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` will depend on the condition inside the loop. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `k`.

4. **New State:**
   - `i` will be 1 (since it was 0 and incremented by 1).
   - `k` remains a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer**.
