Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(k + 1)` function call.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `k` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(k + 1)` requires `k + 1` to be a valid positive integer).

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial values of `i` and `k` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `i` is 0.
- `k` must be a non-negative integer.

Since the other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect the loop's execution, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be a non-negative integer**.
