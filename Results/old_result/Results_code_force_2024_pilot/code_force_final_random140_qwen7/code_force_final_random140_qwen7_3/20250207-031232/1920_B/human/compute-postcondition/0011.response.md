Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `i` is 0, `k + 1` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is already defined and calculated before this line, its value is added to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
