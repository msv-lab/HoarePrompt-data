Output State: **`sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is not equal to 0, and (i + x - 1 >= n)**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, which means `a[i - 1]` is `a[-1]`. However, since array indices are typically zero-based and assuming `a` is a valid list, `a[-1]` would refer to the last element of the list `a`. The other variables `k` and the condition involving `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
