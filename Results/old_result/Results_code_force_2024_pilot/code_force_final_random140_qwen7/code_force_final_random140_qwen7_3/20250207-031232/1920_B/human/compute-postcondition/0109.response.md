Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0, so `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[-1]`, which is undefined in typical Python lists (assuming `a` is a list). However, since the problem does not specify the exact nature of `a`, we assume it is handled appropriately within the context of the list. The value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, so `a[i + x - 1]` is a valid index in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
