Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:**

- `i` will be equal to `k`.
- `ans` will be a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in the list will represent the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, starting from `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and updating according to the conditions specified within the loop body. Specifically, for each iteration `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k`), the value of `sums` will be updated based on whether `i + x - 1 < n` or not. If the condition is met, `sums` will include the subtraction of twice the element at index `i + x - 1` from the previous value of `sums`. If the condition is not met, `sums` will simply be updated by adding the element at index `i - 1`.
