Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `ans` contains `[sums]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is already defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, it does not change the value of `sums`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `k` is still a non-negative integer, `sums` retains its original value, and `ans` now contains the appended value `[sums]`.
