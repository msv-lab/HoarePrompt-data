Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \(n\), \(k\), and \(x\), along with an array of \(n\) integers. For each test case, it sorts the array in descending order, calculates a series of sums based on specific conditions involving the first \(x+1\) elements and subsequent elements of the array, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it outputs the maximum value from this list.**
