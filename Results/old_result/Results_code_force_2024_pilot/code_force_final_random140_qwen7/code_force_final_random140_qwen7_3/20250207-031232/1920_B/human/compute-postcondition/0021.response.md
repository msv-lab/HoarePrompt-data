Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 2, `k + 1` must be greater than 0, and `sums` is `a[1]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is initially set to `a[1]`, `ans` now contains the value of `sums`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
