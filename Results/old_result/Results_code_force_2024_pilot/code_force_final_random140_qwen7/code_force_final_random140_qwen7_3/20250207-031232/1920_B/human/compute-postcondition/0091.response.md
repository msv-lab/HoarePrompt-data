Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`. The list `ans` contains either `[sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]]` or `[sums + a[1]]` based on the condition.
