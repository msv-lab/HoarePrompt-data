Output State: **`sums` is `sums + a[0]`, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is not equal to 0, and (i + x - 1 >= n), ans is a list containing `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]` which simplifies to `sums + a[0]` since `i` is 0 initially. After appending, `i` increments to 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
