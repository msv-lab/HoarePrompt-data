Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user**.

The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` respectively. Since the input values are not specified, they are represented as generic integer inputs from the user.
