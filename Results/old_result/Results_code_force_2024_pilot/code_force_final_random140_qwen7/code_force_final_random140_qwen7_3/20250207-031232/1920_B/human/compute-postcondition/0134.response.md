Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was already defined as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, it adds this value to the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `sums` retains its previous definition.
