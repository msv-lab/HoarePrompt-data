Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers entered by the user, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers entered by the user, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated according to the following rules: if `i` is 0, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and `ans` contains `[sums]`. If `i` is not 0, then `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise `sums` is updated by adding `a[0]`. The final value of `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated either to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i == 0`, or to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or to `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`. `ans` is a list containing one element which is the updated `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i == 0`, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and `ans` is a list with one element `sums`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` is a list with one additional element which is `sums`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
