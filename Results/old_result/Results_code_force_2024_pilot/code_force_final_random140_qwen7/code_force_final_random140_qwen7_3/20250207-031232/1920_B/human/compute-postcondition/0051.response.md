Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is an empty list since no iterations have occurred yet.**

The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n`, `k`, and `x` respectively. Since the original values of `a`, `sum1`, and `ans` are unchanged, they remain as described in the initial state. The `ans` list is initialized as an empty list because no iterations have happened yet.
