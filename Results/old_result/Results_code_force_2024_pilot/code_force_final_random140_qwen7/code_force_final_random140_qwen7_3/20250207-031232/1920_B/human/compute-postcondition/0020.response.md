Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `k + 1` must be greater than 0, and `sums` is `a[1]` (since `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` and initially `sums` was not defined, it is now set to `a[1]`).**

The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the element `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is now 2) to `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
