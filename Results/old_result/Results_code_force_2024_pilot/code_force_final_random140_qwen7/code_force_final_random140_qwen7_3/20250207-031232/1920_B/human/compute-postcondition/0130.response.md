Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `k` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Check the New Value of `i` Relative to `k`:**
   For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.

5. **Adjust the States Based on the Conditions:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Consider the Postconditions:**
   - The postcondition for `i` is `i + 1`.
   - The value of `k` is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - The other variables (`sums` and `ans`) are updated based on conditions inside the loop body, but their values are not specified here. We only need to focus on the loop head variables.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `k`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer**
