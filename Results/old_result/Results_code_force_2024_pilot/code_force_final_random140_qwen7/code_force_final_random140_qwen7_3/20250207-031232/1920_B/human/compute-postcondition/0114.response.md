Postcondition: `i` is not equal to 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is incremented by `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is incremented by `a[0]`. Additionally, `i` is either 1 or remains unchanged, and `ans` is a list containing the final value of `sums`.
