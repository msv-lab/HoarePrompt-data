Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**

Explanation: The variable `sums` is assigned the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The expression `a[:x + 1]` represents the slice of list `a` from the start up to index `x + 1`. The value of `sums` depends on the values of `sum1` and the sum of the sliced part of `a`. The state of `k` being a non-negative integer remains unchanged.
