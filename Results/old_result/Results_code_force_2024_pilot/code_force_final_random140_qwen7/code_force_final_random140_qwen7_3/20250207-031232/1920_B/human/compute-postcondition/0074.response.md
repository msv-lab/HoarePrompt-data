Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` contains `[sums]`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, it remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `k` is still a non-negative integer, and `ans` now contains the value of `sums`.
