Output State: **`sums` is `sums + a[0]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is initially `sums + a[0]` and `i` is 0, `ans` will contain the value of `sums + a[0]` after the append operation. The values of `sums` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
