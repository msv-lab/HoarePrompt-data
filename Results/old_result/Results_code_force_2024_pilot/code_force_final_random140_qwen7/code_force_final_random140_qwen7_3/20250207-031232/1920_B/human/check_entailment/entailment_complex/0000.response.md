Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.
3. The array `a` is sorted in descending order, which is necessary to consider the largest elements first for Alice's removal and Bob's negation.
4. The program then iterates over possible removal counts from 0 to `k` inclusive.
   - When `i == 0`, it calculates the sum if Alice removes the smallest `x+1` elements and Bob negates the next `x` elements.
   - For other values of `i`, it updates the sum by considering the effect of removing one more element and negating up to `x` elements.
5. It stores these sums in a list `ans` and finally prints the maximum value from this list.

Given the logic and the steps taken, the program correctly implements the strategy for both players to play optimally. The approach ensures that Alice maximizes the sum by removing the smallest elements, and Bob minimizes the sum by negating the largest remaining elements.

Correctness: **True**
