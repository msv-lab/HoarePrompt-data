Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are integers entered by the user.**

The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, we can only state that these variables now hold the integers entered by the user.
