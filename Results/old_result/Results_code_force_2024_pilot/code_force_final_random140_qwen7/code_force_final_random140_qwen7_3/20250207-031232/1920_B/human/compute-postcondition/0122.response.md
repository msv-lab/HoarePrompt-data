Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is already in the form of `i + 1`, so it remains unchanged from its initial state. The variable `k` is a non-negative integer and remains unchanged. The variable `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value.
