Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is updated based on the conditions for `i = 1`; `sums` is equal to `sums + a[0]`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to `sums`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i - 1]` translates to `a[0]`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `a[0]`, `sums` is updated to its original value plus `a[0]`. The variables `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
