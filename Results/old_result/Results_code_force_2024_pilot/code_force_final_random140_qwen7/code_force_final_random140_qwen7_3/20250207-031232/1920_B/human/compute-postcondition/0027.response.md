Output State: **`ans` contains the value of `sums`, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Since `ans` was initially empty, after executing this line, `ans` will contain one element, which is the value of `sums`. The values of `sum1`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
