Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a`. Since `a` was initially a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, after reversing it, `a` becomes a sorted list in descending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
