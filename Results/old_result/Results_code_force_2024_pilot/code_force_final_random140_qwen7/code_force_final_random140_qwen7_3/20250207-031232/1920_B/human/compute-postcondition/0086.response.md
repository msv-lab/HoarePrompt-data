Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is used in the expression `a[i - 1]`, which becomes `a[1]` (since `i` is 2). Similarly, `a[i + x - 1]` becomes `a[x]`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the expression. The value of `sums` is updated according to the given expression.
