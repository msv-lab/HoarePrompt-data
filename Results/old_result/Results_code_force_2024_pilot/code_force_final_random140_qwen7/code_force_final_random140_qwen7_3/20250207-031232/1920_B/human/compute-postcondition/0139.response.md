Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i == 0`, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; if `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` remains unchanged. `ans` is a list containing one or two elements, depending on whether `i + x - 1 < n` or `i + x - 1 >= n`.
