Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is a non-negative integer
   - If `i == 0`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
   - Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.
   - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is set to `a[0]` and `ans` contains `[sums]`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is:
   ```python
   for i in range(k + 1):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States**: We need to determine how the states change as the loop proceeds.

   - **Variable `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - **Variable `k`**: The value of `k` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - **Postconditions**: The postconditions depend on the values of `i` and `x`. Since `i` changes from 1 to 2, we need to consider the new condition `i + x - 1 < n` or `i + x - 1 >= n`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` changes from 1 to 2.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- The postconditions need to be evaluated based on the new value of `i`.

Since `i` is now 2, we need to check the conditions:
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.
- If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is set to `a[0]` and `ans` contains `[sums]`.

However, without knowing the exact value of `x` and `n`, we cannot definitively update `sums` and `ans`. But we know that `i` has changed, and the conditions for updating `sums` and `ans` will be based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `i` is 2
- `k` remains a non-negative integer
- The postconditions will be evaluated based on the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, the postconditions will be evaluated based on the new value of `i`**
