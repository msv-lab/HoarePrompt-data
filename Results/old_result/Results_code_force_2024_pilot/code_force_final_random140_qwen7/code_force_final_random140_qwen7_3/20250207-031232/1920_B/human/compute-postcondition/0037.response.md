Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is updated based on the conditions for `i = 1`; `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, `ans` is updated according to its original conditions when `i = 1`, and `sums` is now equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
