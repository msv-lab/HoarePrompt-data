Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is updated based on the conditions for `i = 1`, `sums` is updated based on the conditions for `i = 1 + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is 1) and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` (which is `2 * a[x]` since `i` is 1). The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
