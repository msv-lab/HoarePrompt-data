Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` contains the value of `sums + a[0]`; `sums` is equal to `sums + a[0]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state where `sums` is equal to `sums + a[0]`, `ans` now contains the value of `sums + a[0]`. The values of `i` and `sums` are updated accordingly, but no other variables are affected.
