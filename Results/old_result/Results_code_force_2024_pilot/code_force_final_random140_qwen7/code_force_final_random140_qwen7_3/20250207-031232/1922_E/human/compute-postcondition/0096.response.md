Output State: **`min` is -100000000, `ans` is '-100000000 ', `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 100000000, `t` is 0, and `x` is odd.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `min` (which is "-100000000") to the existing value of `ans` with a space in between. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `ans` becomes "-100000000 ". The values of `i`, `max`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged.
