Output State: **`min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is either ' ' + `max` + ' ' + ' ' + `ans` or '-100000000 ' + ' ' + `ans`, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `t` is 1, `x` is 0.5**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and the result is an integer (floor division). Given that the initial value of `x` is not 1, it is updated to 0.5. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
