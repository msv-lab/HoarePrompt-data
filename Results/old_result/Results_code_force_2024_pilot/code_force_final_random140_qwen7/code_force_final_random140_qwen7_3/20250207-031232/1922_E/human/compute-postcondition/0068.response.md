Postcondition: `t` is 1, `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `min` is -999999, `ans` is either 'max ' followed by the result of dividing `x` by 2 (if `x` is even) or the string '-100000000 ', and `max` is decreased by 1 if `x` is even; otherwise, `x` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is concatenated with the original `min` value.
