Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `min` is -100000000, `max` is -100000001, `ans` is 'max ', `x` is `x` divided by 2.**

The code `x = x // 2` divides the value of `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` is an input integer and must not be equal to 1, after the operation, `x` becomes `x` divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
