Based on the initial state provided:

- `min` is -1.
- `ans` is a string containing all the `min` and `max` values from each iteration with appropriate spacing.
- `i` is `input_value - 1`.
- `max` is 1.
- `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.

Since `min` starts at -100000000 and increments by 1 each time `x` is odd, and `max` starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 each time `x` is even, the final values of `min` and `max` after the loop completes will be -1 and 1, respectively.

The variable `ans` will contain a concatenated string of all the `min` and `max` values from each iteration. Given the final values of `min` and `max`, `ans` will include these values in the format specified.

Since `x` will eventually become 1, the loop will terminate, and the final values of `min` and `max` will be used to construct the string `ans`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the string `ans` which contains the final values of `min` and `max`.

Output: **-1 1**
