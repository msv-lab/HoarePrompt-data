Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either -0.5 or `original_x_value - 2`, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999999, `ans` is a string containing `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing followed by ' ' and the original `ans` value, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `x` was either 0.5 or `original_x_value - 1`. After decrementing by 1, `x` becomes either -0.5 or `original_x_value - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
