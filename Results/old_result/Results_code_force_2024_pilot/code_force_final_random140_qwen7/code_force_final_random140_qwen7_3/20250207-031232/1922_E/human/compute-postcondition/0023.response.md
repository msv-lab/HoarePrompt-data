Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` must be different from 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is either '100000000 -99999999' or '-100000000 -99999999', depending on whether `x` is even or not.**

Explanation: The code `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Initially, `min` was `-99999999`. After incrementing, `min` becomes `-99999998`. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `max`, and `ans`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
