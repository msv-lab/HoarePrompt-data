Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either half of its original value or 0 but not 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a string combining `min` and the original `ans` with a space in between.**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans` concatenates the value of `min` (which can be either -99999999 or -99999998) with a space and the original value of `ans` (which can be one of four combinations based on the value of `x`). The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
