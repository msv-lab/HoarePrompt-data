Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `min` is either -100000000 or -999999, `ans` is 'max ' followed by the result of dividing `x` by 2 (if `x` is even) or the string '-100000000 ', `max` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `max` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
