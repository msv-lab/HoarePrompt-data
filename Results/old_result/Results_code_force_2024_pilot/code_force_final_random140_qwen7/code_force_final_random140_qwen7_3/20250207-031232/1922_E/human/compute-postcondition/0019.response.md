Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` must be different from 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '99999999 100000000' or '99999999 -100000000', depending on whether `x` is even or not.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `max` with a space and the current value of `ans`. Since `max` is 99999999, `ans` is updated to be '99999999' concatenated with either '100000000' or '-100000000', depending on the parity of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
