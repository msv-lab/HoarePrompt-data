Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `t` is 2.
   - `x` is an integer not equal to 1.
   - `min` is -999999.
   - `ans` is either 'max ' followed by the result of dividing `x` by 2 (if `x` is even) or the string '-100000000 '.
   - `max` is decreased by 1 if `x` is even; otherwise, `x` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is concatenated with the original `min` value.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**:
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must not be equal to 1. Therefore, `x` must be changed to a value that is still not equal to 1.

### Adjusting the States:

- **`t`**: The value of `t` is 2, and it is not part of the loop condition. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.
- **`x`**: Since the loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 1, `x` must be adjusted to a value that is still not equal to 1.
- **`min`**: The value of `min` is -999999, and it is not part of the loop condition. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `min`.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is determined based on the value of `x` and `max`, but since the loop condition is based on `x`, no adjustment is needed for `ans` directly.
- **`max`**: The value of `max` is not directly relevant to the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for `max`.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `x` to ensure it remains not equal to 1.

### Final Answer:

State: **`t` is 2, `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `min` is -999999, `ans` is either 'max ' followed by the result of dividing `x` by 2 (if `x` is even) or the string '-100000000 ', and `max` is decreased by 1 if `x` is even; otherwise, `x` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is concatenated with the original `min` value, and `x` must be adjusted to a value that is still not equal to 1**.
