Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `min` is either -100000000 or -999999, `ans` is 'max ' followed by the result of dividing `x` by 2 (if `x` is even) or the string '-100000000 ', `max` is decreased by 1, `x` is `x` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` was an input integer and must not be equal to 1, after the division, `x` becomes `x // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
