Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '100000000 '**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `max` (which is "100000000") to the string `ans` followed by a space. Initially, `ans` is an empty string, so after executing the code, `ans` becomes "100000000 ". The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
