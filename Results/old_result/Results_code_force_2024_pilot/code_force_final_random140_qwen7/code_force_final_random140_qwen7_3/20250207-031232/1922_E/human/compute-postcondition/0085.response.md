Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is an input integer, `min` is -999999, `ans` is a string that contains a sequence of numbers based on the operations performed during each iteration, `i` is `input_value - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `x`. All other variables (`t`, `min`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The input value is converted to an integer before being assigned to `x`.
