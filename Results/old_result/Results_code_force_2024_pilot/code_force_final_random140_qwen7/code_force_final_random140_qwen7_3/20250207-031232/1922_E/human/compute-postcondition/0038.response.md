Output State: `t` is the total number of iterations it took to reach `x` as 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 1, `min` is -1, and `ans` is a string that contains all the values of `max` and `min` from each iteration in reverse order, separated by spaces.

To elaborate, since the loop continues until `x` becomes 1, the final value of `x` will be 1. The variable `t` will be equal to the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1. The values of `max` and `min` will be 1 and -1, respectively, because `max` starts at 99999999 and decreases by 1 each time `x` is odd, and `min` starts at -100000000 and increases by 1 each time `x` is odd. The `ans` variable will contain all the values of `max` and `min` from each iteration in reverse order, as each value is prepended to `ans` during each iteration.
