Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified by \(X\). Instead, it generates a sequence of numbers by alternating between the maximum and minimum possible values within the given range, which does not guarantee the desired number of increasing subsequences.

For instance, consider the input \(X = 2\). The program will output an array of length 1 containing the value 0, which indeed has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just 0). However, for other values of \(X\), the program fails to meet the requirement. For example, if \(X = 5\), the program outputs an array of length 3 with elements 100000000, -100000000, and 100000000, which does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences. The program does not handle the generation of arrays with the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified, making it incorrect.
