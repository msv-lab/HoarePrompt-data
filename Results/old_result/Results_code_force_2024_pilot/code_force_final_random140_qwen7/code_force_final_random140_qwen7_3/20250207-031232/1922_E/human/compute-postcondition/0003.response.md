Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input non-negative integer less than `t`, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `min` to `-100000000`. Since `t`, `x`, and `max` were already defined in the initial state and no operations were performed on them, their values remain unchanged. The new value of `min` is explicitly set to `-100000000`.
