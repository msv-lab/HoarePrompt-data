Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 1, `max` is 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a string equal to 'max' followed by a space and the original value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides `x` by 2 using integer division. Given the initial state, `x` is either half of its original value (which would make it 1) or 0 but not 1. After the operation, `x` will be 0 because it cannot be 1 (as per the given conditions). All other variables (`t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
