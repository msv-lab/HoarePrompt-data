### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The array length must be at most 200.
   - The array elements should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
   - If no such array exists, output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program attempts to construct the array using a binary representation approach.
   - It initializes `max` and `min` to represent the largest and smallest possible values for the array elements.
   - It uses a loop to construct the string `ans` by alternating between setting elements to `max` and `min`.
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1, which theoretically represents the number of elements needed in the array.

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Increasing Subsequences:**
     - The program does not correctly ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
     - The logic of alternating between `max` and `min` does not guarantee the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - **Handling Edge Cases:**
     - The program does not handle cases where `X` cannot be achieved with an array of length at most 200.
     - For example, if `X` is very large, the program will attempt to construct an array of length 100000000, which exceeds the limit.
   - **Output Format:**
     - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, but it does not correctly calculate the array to meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Correct Solution Approach:**
   - To generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences, we need to understand the combinatorial properties of increasing subsequences.
   - One effective way is to use a binary representation of `X`. Each bit in the binary representation can indicate the presence of a specific element in the array.
   - For example, if `X` is represented in binary as `1010`, we can create an array `[0, 1, 0, 1]` which has exactly 6 increasing subsequences (all combinations of choosing 1 or 0).

5. **Revised Program:**
   - Convert `X` to its binary representation.
   - Create an array where each bit position corresponds to an element in the array.
   - This ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the number of ways to choose subsets of the array.

Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure the construction of an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
