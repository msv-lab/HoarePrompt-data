Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a test case where 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, 'X' is an integer between 2 and 10^18. The function returns a value based on the relationship between 't' and 'X'.**

This means the function processes a set of test cases defined by the values of 't' and 'X', and based on these values, it returns a specific outcome without any direct parameters passed to it within the function definition.
