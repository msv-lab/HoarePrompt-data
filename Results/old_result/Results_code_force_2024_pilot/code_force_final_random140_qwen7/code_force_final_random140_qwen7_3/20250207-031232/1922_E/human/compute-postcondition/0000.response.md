Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - The value of `i` is determined by the expression `int(input())`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is within the range \(0 \leq \text{input value} < t\). However, since `t` is provided as a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as the input value is a non-negative integer less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` will be set by the input, but we need to ensure that the input is valid (non-negative and less than `t`).
   - The variable `t` should be set to its given value.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `t` must be set to a value between 1 and 1000.
- The input value for `i` must be a non-negative integer less than `t`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the input value for `i` must be a non-negative integer less than `t`**.
