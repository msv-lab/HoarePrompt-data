Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either 0.5 or `original_x_value - 1`, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a string containing `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing followed by ' ' and `max`, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is 99999998**

Explanation: The code `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Given the initial state, `max` was either 99999998 or 99999999. After decrementing, `max` becomes 99999997 or 99999998. However, since the problem asks to include the exact values from the initial state, we keep `max` as 99999998. All other variables remain unchanged.
