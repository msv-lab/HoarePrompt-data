Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input non-negative integer less than `t`.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` reads a non-negative integer from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. Since the input value for `i` (which is now stored in `x`) must be a non-negative integer less than `t`, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The initial value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` is updated to the input value which is a non-negative integer less than `t`.
