Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 1.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.
   - `max` is calculated as \(100000000 - t\).
   - `min` is calculated as \(-100000000 + t\).
   - `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and ending with `min`.

2. **Understanding the Iterations:**
   - Since `x` starts at 1, no iterations are needed to reduce `x` to 1. Therefore, `t` is 0.
   - Substituting `t = 0` into the formulas for `max` and `min`:
     - `max = 100000000 - 0 = 100000000`
     - `min = -100000000 + 0 = -100000000`

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - `ans` contains alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and ending with `min`.
   - Given `max = 100000000` and `min = -100000000`, `ans` will be constructed as follows:
     - Start with `max`: `100000000`
     - Followed by `min`: `-100000000`
     - End with `min`: `-100000000`

4. **Final `ans`:**
   - The final value of `ans` is `"100000000 -100000000 -100000000"`.

5. **Executing the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **100000000 -100000000 -100000000**
