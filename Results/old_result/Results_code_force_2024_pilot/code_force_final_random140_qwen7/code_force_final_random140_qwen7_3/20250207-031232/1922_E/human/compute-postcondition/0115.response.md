Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either 0.25 or `(original_x_value - 1) / 2`, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a string containing `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing followed by ' ' and `max`, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is 99999998**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides the current value of `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` can either be 0.5 or `original_x_value - 1`, dividing these by 2 results in 0.25 and `(original_x_value - 1) / 2` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
