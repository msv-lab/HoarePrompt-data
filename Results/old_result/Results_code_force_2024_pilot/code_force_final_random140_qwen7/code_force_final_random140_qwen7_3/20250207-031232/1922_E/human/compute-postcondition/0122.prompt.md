Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `input_value - 1`, `max` is 100000000, `t` is 0
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is either ' ' + `max` or '-100000000 ', `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `t` is 1, and `x` is either the current value of `x` divided by 2 (if it was even) or is odd.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `x` is either 0.5 or `original_x_value - 1`, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a string containing `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `x` can be either 0.25 or (`\text{original\_x\_value} - 1) / 2` or -0.5 or `\text{original\_x\_value} - 2`, `min` can be either -99999999, -100000000, -99999998, or -99999999, `ans` is a string containing `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing, possibly followed by ' ' and `max` or the original `ans` value, `i` can be either `\text{input\_value} - 1` or `\text{input\_value} - 2`, `max` can be either 99999998 or 99999999.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
