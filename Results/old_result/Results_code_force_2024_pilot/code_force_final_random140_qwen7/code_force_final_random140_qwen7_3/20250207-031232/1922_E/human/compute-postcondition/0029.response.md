Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either half of its original value or 0 but not 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a string equal to 'max' followed by a space and the original value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans` updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `max` with a space and the original value of `ans`. The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
