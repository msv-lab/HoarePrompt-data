Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either half of its original value or 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either '99999999 100000000' or '99999999 -100000000' or '100000000 -99999999' or '-100000000 -99999999', depending on whether `x` is even or not.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them in the given code snippet.
