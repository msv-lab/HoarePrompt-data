Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input non-negative integer less than `t`, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `t = 0` changes the value of `t` from a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
