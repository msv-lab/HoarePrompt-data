Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either half of its original value - 1 or -1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a string combining `min` and the original `ans` with a space in between.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was either half of its original value or 0 but not 1, now `x` will be either half of its original value - 1 or -1. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
