Output State: **`t` is equal to the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is an input integer, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code `ans = ''` initializes `ans` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, or `min`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
