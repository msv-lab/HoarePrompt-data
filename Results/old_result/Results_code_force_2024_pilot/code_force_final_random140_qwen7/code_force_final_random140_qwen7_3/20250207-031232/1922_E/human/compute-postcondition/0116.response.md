Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either 0.5 or `original_x_value - 1`, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a string containing `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing followed by ' ' and the original `ans` value, `i` is either `input_value - 1` or `input_value - 2`, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999**.

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans` concatenates the string representation of `min` with a space and the original value of `ans`. Since `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000, and `ans` is a string containing `min` and `max` values with appropriate spacing, the new value of `ans` will be the original `ans` value with `min` and a space prepended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
