Output State: **`t` is equal to the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, and `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and ending with `min`.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `x` is now an input integer.
