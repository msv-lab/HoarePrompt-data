Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n`, `m`, and `k` are now integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, and `result` are updated accordingly. The `prices` list remains unchanged except for being reassigned with the new values from the input split and converted to integers. The `result` variable is left as the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.
