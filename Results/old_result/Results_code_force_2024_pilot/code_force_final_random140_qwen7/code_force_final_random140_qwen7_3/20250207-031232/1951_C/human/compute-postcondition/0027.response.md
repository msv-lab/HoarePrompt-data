Output State: **`i` is 2, `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, `total_cost` is `total_cost + cost', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `i`, `tickets_bought`, `cost`, and `total_cost`. It only indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional structure.
