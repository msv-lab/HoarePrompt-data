Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `prices = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a string input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `prices`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `result` remain unchanged. The `result` variable is mentioned to be the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`, which is assumed to be unchanged by this line of code.
