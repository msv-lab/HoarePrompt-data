Output State: **`i` is 2, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`**

In this scenario, the code assigns the value of `tickets_to_buy` to the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. Since the initial values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, they remain as they were. The variables `m`, `k`, and `tickets_bought` are now involved in the calculation of `tickets_to_buy`, but their specific values are not provided, so `tickets_to_buy` is expressed as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
