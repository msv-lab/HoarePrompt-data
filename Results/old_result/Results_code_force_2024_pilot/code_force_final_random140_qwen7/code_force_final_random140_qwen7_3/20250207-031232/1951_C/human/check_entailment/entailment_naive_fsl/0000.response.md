Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a day causes the price increase for subsequent days. Let's consider the following example:

### Example Input:
```
3 2 5
8 6 4
```

### Expected Output:
To buy 5 tickets with the given constraints, we need to consider the following strategy:
- On the first day, we can buy 2 tickets at 8 each, costing 16. This increases the prices for the next day to [10, 4].
- On the second day, we can buy 3 tickets at 4 each, costing 12. This increases the prices for the next day to [10].

Thus, the total cost should be `16 + 12 = 28`.

However, the provided program does not account for the price increase correctly. It simply sorts the prices and buys tickets without considering the cumulative effect of buying tickets on subsequent days.

### Program Behavior:
The program sorts the prices and buys tickets based on the sorted order, which does not take into account the price increase mechanism. Therefore, it will not produce the correct result for this input.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle the price increase mechanism, it is incorrect for at least one potential case. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
