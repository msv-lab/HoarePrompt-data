Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**.

The code calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the return value of the function call. All other variables retain their initial states.
