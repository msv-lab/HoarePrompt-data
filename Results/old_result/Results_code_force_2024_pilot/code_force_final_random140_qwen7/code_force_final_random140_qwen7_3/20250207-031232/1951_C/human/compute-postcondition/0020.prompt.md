You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). prices is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i represents the price per ticket on day i, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    """Handles input and output for multiple test cases."""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of test cases, `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for each test case.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` should be at least as large as the number of test cases processed, and for each iteration, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` will hold the respective values for that test case, with `result` being the output of `func_1` for those inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Additionally, it accepts a list `prices` of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a_i` represents the price per ticket on day `i`, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints and relationships.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
