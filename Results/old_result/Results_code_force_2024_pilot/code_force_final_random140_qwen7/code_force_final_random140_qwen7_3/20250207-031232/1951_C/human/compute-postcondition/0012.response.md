The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
