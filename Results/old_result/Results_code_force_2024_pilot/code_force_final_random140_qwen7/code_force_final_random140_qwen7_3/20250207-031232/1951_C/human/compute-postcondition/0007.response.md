Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `m` is the second integer input.
   - `k` is the third integer input.
   - `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

4. **Determine the adjustments needed**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain greater than 0 unless explicitly modified within the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot assume any changes to `t` inside the loop.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the only variable in the loop head is `t`, and it must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue, the state remains the same for these variables. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `result`) do not change based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
