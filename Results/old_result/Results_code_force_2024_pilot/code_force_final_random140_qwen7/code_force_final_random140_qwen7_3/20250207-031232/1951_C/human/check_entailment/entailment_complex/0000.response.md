Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets across `n` days.
   - It sorts the prices in ascending order, ensuring that tickets are bought from the cheapest day first.
   - It iteratively buys up to `m` tickets per day, updating the total cost and reducing the remaining number of tickets to be bought.
   - The logic correctly handles the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought exceeds the available days or the maximum tickets per day limit.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.
   - The function ensures that the inputs are processed correctly and the results are printed as required.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, both functions work correctly and together they satisfy the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
