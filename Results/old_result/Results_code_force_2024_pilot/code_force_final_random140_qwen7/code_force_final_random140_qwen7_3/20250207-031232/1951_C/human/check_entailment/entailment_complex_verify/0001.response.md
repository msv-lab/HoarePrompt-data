### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The sorting of the prices list is unnecessary and can be removed since the algorithm does not rely on the order of prices but rather on the cumulative effect of buying tickets.
2. **Algorithm Logic**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It always buys tickets at the lowest available price first, which might not lead to the minimum cost. For example, consider the case where the prices are `[10, 1, 10]` and `k = 2`. Buying 2 tickets at the first price of 10 would cost 20, but buying 1 ticket at 1 and then 1 ticket at 10 would cost 11, which is cheaper.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to buy up to `i` tickets on day `j`.

The proposed corrected program uses a dynamic programming approach to ensure the minimum cost is found. Here's a breakdown of the corrected program:

- **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: `dp[i][j]` is initialized to infinity, except for `dp[0][0]` which is set to 0.
- **Filling the DP Table**: For each day `i` and each possible number of tickets `j`, the program considers buying up to `m` tickets at the current price and updates the DP table accordingly.
- **Result Extraction**: The final result is extracted from `dp[n][k]`.

Given the analysis and the provided corrected program, the original program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed logic and unnecessary sorting.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the minimum cost and uses an unnecessary sorting step.
