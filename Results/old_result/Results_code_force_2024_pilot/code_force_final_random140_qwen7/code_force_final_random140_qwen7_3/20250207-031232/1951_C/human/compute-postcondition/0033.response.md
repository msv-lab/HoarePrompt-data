Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sale days), `m` (the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (the total number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of `n` positive integers representing the price per ticket for each day). It sorts the prices in ascending order and then iteratively buys tickets starting from the cheapest day until `k` tickets are purchased. The function returns the total cost of these tickets.**
