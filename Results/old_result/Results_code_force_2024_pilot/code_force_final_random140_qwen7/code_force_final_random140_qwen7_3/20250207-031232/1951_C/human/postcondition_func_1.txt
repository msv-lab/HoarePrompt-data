The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets (`m`), the maximum total price (`k`), and a list of ticket prices (`prices`). It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of test cases (`t`) is at least as many as the test cases processed, and for each test case, it correctly handles the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`, producing a result from `func_1` for each.
