Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of test cases, `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for each test case.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` should be at least as large as the number of test cases processed. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read as inputs, `prices` is a list of integers derived from further input, and `result` is the outcome of the function `func_1` applied to these inputs.
