You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` should be at least as large as the number of test cases processed, and for each iteration, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` will hold the respective values for that test case, with `result` being the output of `func_1` for those inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets (`m`), the maximum total price (`k`), and a list of ticket prices (`prices`). It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of test cases (`t`) is at least as many as the test cases processed, and for each test case, it correctly handles the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`, producing a result from `func_1` for each.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days with a maximum of `m` tickets per day.
   - It sorts the list of prices, which is unnecessary because the algorithm does not rely on the order of prices but rather on the cumulative effect of buying tickets.
   - It iterates through each day, calculating how many tickets can be bought at the current price without exceeding `k` tickets.
   - The cost is calculated by multiplying the number of tickets to be bought by the current price.
   - The function breaks out of the loop once `k` tickets are bought.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles reading input and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of prices.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - Sorting the prices list is unnecessary and can be removed. The algorithm does not depend on the order of prices but rather on the cumulative effect of buying tickets.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It always buys tickets at the lowest available price first, which might not lead to the minimum cost. For example, consider the case where the prices are `[10, 1, 10]` and `k = 2`. Buying 2 tickets at the first price of 10 would cost 20, but buying 1 ticket at 1 and then 1 ticket at 10 would cost 11, which is cheaper.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to buy up to `i` tickets on day `j`.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program using a dynamic programming approach:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(k + 1):
            for x in range(min(m, j) + 1):
                if j >= x:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-x] + x * prices[i-1])
    
    return dp[n][k]

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
        print(result)

func_2()
```
