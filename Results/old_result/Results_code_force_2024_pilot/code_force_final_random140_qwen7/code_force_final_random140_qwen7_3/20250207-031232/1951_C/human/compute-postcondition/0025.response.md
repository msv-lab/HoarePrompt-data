Output State: **`i` is 2, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, `total_cost` is `total_cost + cost`**

Explanation: The code `total_cost += cost` adds the value of `cost` to `total_cost`. Since `cost` is defined as `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, the updated value of `total_cost` is the original `total_cost` plus `cost`. The other variables (`i`, `tickets_to_buy`, and `cost`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
