Output State: **`i` is 2, `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, `total_cost` is `total_cost + cost`**

Explanation: The line `tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy` increments the value of `tickets_bought` by the current value of `tickets_to_buy`. Since `tickets_to_buy` is defined as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, the updated value of `tickets_bought` will be the original value of `tickets_bought` plus `tickets_to_buy`. The values of `i`, `cost`, and `total_cost` remain unchanged from their initial states.
