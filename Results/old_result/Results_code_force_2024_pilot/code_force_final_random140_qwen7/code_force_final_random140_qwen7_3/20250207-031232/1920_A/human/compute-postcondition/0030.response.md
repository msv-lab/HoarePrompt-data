Postcondition: `start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input. Since the else part is not provided and the if condition does not change the variables' values or add new conditions, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
