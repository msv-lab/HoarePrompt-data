Reasoning:
1. The problem requires processing a series of constraints to determine the number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints.
2. The provided code correctly handles the input and processes the constraints as follows:
   - `func_1` is used to read the number of test cases and the number of constraints per test case.
   - `func_2` is used to parse the input constraints.
   - `func_7` processes each constraint and calculates the valid range for \( k \).
   - The main program iterates over each test case, calling `func_7` to get the result and prints it.
3. `func_7` correctly identifies the minimum and maximum bounds for \( k \) based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and it correctly filters out the invalid values from the list of constraints of type 3.
4. The logic in `func_7` ensures that the final count of valid \( k \) values is calculated accurately by subtracting the count of invalid values from the total possible range.
5. The code handles all the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided code meets the requirements of the problem and processes the constraints accurately.

Correctness: **True**
