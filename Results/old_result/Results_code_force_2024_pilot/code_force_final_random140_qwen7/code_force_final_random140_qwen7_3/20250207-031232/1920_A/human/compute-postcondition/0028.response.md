Output State: **`start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input**

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to the variables `t` and `v`. The initial values of `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `start` and `end` are both `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer input, and `v` is the second integer input.
