Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in num`. The variables involved here are `i`, `num`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1.
   - `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2.
   - `num` must contain at least one element.
   - `count_num` is 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - If the current value of `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains 0.
   - Otherwise, `i` is within the range `[start, end]` and `count_num` is incremented to 1.

4. **Analyze the Current State**:
   - We know `num` contains at least one element.
   - `count_num` is currently 1.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `count_num` is 1, it means that the current value of `i` is within the range `[start, end]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be an element of `num` and within the range `[start, end]`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be the next element in `num`, and `count_num` will remain 1 as long as `i` is within the range `[start, end]`.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `num` will still contain at least one element (since we are iterating through it).
   - `count_num` will remain 1 if the next `i` is within the range `[start, end]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` must contain at least one element, and `count_num` is 1.**
