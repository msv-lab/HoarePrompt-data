Output State: **`start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v, v, v]`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Initially, `num` contains `[v, v]`. After appending `v`, `num` becomes `[v, v, v]`. The values of `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged.
