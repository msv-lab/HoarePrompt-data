Output State: **`start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v, v]`, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer from the input, `v` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `t` and `v`. The values of `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The input integers are stored in `t` and `v`.
