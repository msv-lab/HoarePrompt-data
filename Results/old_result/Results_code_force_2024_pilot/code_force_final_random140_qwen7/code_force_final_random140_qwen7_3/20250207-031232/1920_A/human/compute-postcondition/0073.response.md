Output State: **`start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `count_num` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `count_num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count_num` is either 1 or 2. After adding 1 to `count_num`, the new value of `count_num` becomes 2. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
