t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of n constraints where n is an integer. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer. Constraints of type 1 indicate k must be greater than or equal to x, constraints of type 2 indicate k must be less than or equal to x, and constraints of type 3 indicate k must not be equal to x.
