Output State: **`start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3, and `count_num` is 0.**

The variable `count_num` is initialized to 0, which means no counting has started or completed. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `num`, and `i`) retain their previous values as per the initial state.
