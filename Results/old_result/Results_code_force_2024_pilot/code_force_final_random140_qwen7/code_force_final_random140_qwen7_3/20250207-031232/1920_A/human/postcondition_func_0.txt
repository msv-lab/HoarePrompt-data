The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is false, it returns an integer input provided by the user, constrained by the conditions 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Additionally, for each test case, there are exactly n lines describing constraints where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. If `isOne` is true, it returns 1. After the function concludes, the variable `isOne` retains its original value.
