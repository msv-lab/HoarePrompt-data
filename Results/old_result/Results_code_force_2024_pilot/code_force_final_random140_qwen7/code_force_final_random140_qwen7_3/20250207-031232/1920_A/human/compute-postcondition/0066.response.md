Postcondition: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` must contain at least one element, and `count_num` is 1. If the current value of `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains 0, otherwise `i` is within the range [start, end] and `count_num` is incremented to 1.
