Output State: **`start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet simply reassigns the value of `start` to -1, but does not affect the values of `end` or `num`. Therefore, the initial values of `end` and `num` remain unchanged, and only `start` is updated to -1.
