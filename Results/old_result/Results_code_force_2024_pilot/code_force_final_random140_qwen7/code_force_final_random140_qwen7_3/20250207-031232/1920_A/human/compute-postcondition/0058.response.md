Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `num`.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the list `num`.
   - For the loop to start, `num` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `start`: This is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1.
   - `end`: This is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2.
   - `num`: This is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3.
   - `count_num`: This is the count of elements in the list `num`, initialized to 0.

Given that the loop will iterate over `num`, `num` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is not empty.

**Final State**:
- `start` remains as the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1.
- `end` remains as the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2.
- `num` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `count_num` is 0, but this is not directly relevant to the loop starting condition.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` must contain at least one element, and `count_num` is 0**.
