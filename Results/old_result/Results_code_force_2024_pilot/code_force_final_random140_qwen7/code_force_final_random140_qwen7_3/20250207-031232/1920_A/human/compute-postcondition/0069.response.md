Output State: **`start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` must contain at least one element, and `count_num` is 2.**

The code `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. Given the initial state where `count_num` is 1, after executing this line of code, `count_num` becomes 2. All other variables (`start`, `end`, and `num`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
