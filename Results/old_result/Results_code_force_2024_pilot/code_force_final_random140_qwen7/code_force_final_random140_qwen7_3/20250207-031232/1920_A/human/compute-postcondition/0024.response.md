Output State: **`start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `i` is 0, `t` is 3**.

Explanation: The code snippet `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Initially, `num` is an empty list. After appending `v`, `num` becomes a list containing `[v]`. The values of `start`, `end`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged.
