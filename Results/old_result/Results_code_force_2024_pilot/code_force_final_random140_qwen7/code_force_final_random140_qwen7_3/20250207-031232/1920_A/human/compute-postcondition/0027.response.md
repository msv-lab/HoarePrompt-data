Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start` is `v`
   - `end` is `v`
   - `num` is a list containing `[v]`
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` is 3

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n)`. This means the loop will run as long as `i < n`.

4. **Analyze the changes in the loop body**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the typical operations that might occur within the loop. However, based on the information provided, there are no specific changes mentioned for `i` or `n` inside the loop.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration. Therefore, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `start` remains `v`
   - `end` remains `v`
   - `num` remains a list containing `[v]`
   - `i` becomes 1
   - `t` remains 3

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `i` is 1, `t` is 3**
