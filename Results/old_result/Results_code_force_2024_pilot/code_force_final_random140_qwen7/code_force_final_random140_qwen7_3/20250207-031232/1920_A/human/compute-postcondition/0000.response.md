Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) because of the initial condition specified.
