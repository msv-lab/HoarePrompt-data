Output State: **`start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` must contain at least one element, and `count_num` is 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
