Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and returns it. It also handles the special case when `isOne` is `True`, but this is not used in the main logic and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

2. **Function `func_7`**: This function is designed to process each test case and calculate the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It correctly initializes `start` and `end` to handle the constraints of type 1 and type 2 respectively. It also collects all numbers from constraints of type 3 in the list `num`.

3. **Logic in `func_7`**:
   - For constraints of type 1 (`t == 1`), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - For constraints of type 2 (`t == 2`), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`t == 3`), it adds `v` to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts how many numbers in `num` do not fall within the range `[start, end]` and subtracts this count from the total possible integers in the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final result is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start <= end`; otherwise, it returns 0. This calculation correctly accounts for the valid range of `k` and excludes the invalid numbers.

Given the execution summary and the logic described, the function `func_7` correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem for each test case. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
