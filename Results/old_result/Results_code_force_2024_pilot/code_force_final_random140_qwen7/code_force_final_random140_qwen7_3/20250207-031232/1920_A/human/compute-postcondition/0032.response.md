Postcondition: **`start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input.** 

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because there is no modification to the variables within the if part, and there is no else part to consider.
