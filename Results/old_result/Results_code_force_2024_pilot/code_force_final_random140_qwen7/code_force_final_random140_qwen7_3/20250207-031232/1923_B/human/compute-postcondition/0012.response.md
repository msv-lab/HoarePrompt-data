Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and lists of integers `a_i` and `x_i`. It ensures that the input `t` is non-negative. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. After processing all test cases, the function guarantees that the value of `t` is at least 0.**
