Output State: **`r` is `k - 2*b[1] + k`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The initial state is `r` is `k - b[1] + k`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. The code `r -= b[i]` subtracts the value of `b[i]` from `r`. Since `i` is 2, `r` is updated to `k - b[1] + k - b[2]`, which simplifies to `k - 2*b[1] + k`. Also, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition `if r < b[i]` is not checked as it is not necessary to determine the final state.
