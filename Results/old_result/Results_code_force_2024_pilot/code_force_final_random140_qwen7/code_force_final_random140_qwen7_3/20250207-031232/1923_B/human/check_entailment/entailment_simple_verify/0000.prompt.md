You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    YES

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

        #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the value of `x` is an input integer, and `b[abs(x)]` is increased by `a[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations, the list `b` will have been updated such that for each index `j` (where `1` ≤ `j` ≤ `max(abs(a))`), `b[j]` will be the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` where `abs(a[i]) == j`.
        #

        #
        #To understand this, let's break down the process:
        #
        #- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. 
        #- In each iteration, `r` is incremented by `k` and then decreased by `b[i]`.
        #- After `n` iterations, `r` will have been incremented `n` times by `k` and decreased `n` times by the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `b`.
        #
        #So, the final value of `r` will be `k * n - sum(b[1:n])`. However, since the loop stops as soon as `r < b[i]`, the actual number of iterations could be less than `n` if `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:i-1]) < b[i]` for some `i`. But based on the given information, we assume the loop runs for all `n` iterations without any early termination conditions affecting the general formula derived.
        #
        #Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `r` being `k * (n - 1) - sum(b[1:n])`.
        print('YES')

Therefore, regardless of how many times the loop runs, `t` cannot become negative.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the movement and shooting of monsters as described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that after shooting bullets, alive monsters move closer to the player. Instead, it simply sums the health points of monsters at each distance from the player and checks if the total health can be reduced to zero within the given time. This approach fails to handle the dynamic nature of the problem where monsters move towards the player after each second.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

The program would incorrectly determine that you can survive because it sums the health points of monsters at distances 1 and 2 from the player, which totals to 6. Since \(2 \times 2 = 4\) (which is less than 6), the program prints 'NO'. However, according to the problem description, you can actually survive by shooting one bullet at the monster at distance 1 and one bullet at the monster at distance 2 during the first second, killing both monsters before they can move closer to the player. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
