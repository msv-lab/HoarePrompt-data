Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is `k - b[i]`
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be a positive integer

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` in the range `1` to `n + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

5. **Determine the new condition for `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`. Since `i` is now 2, the condition `2 < n + 1` must hold true. This simplifies to `n > 1`.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to update these variables accordingly.

**Final State**:
- `r` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` is updated to 2.
- `n` must still be a positive integer but now must satisfy the condition `n > 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`r` is `k - b[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
