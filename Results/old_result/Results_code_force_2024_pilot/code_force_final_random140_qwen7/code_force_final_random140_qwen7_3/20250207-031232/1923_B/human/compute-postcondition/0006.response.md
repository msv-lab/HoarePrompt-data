Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignment or modification of variables like `t`), the only information we have is that `t` must still be greater than or equal to 0, which is the initial condition.
