Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This sets `t` to be an integer representing the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `x_i`) are not yet defined and retain their initial state as described in the precondition.
