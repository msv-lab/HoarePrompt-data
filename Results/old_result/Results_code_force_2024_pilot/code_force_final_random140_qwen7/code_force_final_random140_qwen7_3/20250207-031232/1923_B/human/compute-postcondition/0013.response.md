Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the value of `x` is an input integer, and `b[abs(x)]` is increased by `a[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations, the list `b` will have been updated such that for each index `j` (where `1` ≤ `j` ≤ `max(abs(a))`), `b[j]` will be the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` where `abs(a[i]) == j`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `b` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in list `a` grouped by their absolute values.
