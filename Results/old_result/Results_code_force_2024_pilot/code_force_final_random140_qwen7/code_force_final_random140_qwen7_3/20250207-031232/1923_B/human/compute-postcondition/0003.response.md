Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop decrements `t` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, for the next iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 (because if `t` was exactly 1, it would be decremented to 0, and the loop would stop).

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
