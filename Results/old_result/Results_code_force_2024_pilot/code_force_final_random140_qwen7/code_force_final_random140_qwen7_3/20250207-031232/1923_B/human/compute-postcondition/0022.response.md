Output State: **`r` is `k - b[i]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer**

Explanation: The variable `r` is updated by subtracting `b[i]` from its current value. Given that `r` was initially `0 + k`, after executing `r -= b[i]`, `r` becomes `k - b[i]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
