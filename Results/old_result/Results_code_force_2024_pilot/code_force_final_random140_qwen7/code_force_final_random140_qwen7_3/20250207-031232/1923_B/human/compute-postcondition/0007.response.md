Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Natural Language Explanation: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 0. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, it means that `t` has been decremented (or modified) in each iteration but never went below 0. Therefore, the final value of `t` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
