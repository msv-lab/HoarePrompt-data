Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.

In natural language: The value of `t` must be at least 0 after all the iterations of the loop have finished. This is because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, and even if `t` becomes 0, the loop will stop executing. Therefore, regardless of how many times the loop runs, `t` cannot become negative.
