Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language: The value of `t` must be at least 0 after the execution of the `try` statement. This is because the loop in the `try` block continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Even if `t` becomes 0, the loop will stop executing. Therefore, regardless of how many times the loop runs, `t` cannot become negative. If a `ValueError` is raised during the execution of the `try` block, the function will print "Invalid input format" and then the value of `t` will still be non-negative, as the loop would have stopped before `t` became negative.
