Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `r` is calculated as `k - b[1] + k`, but since `b` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.
- `n` is mentioned to be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print('NO')` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `r`, `i`, or `n`.
