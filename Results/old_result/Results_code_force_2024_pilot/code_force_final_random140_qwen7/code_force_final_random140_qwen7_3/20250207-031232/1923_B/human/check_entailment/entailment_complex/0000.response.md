Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the input values for \( n \), \( k \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a list \( b \) of \( n+1 \) zeros.
   - It updates the list \( b \) such that for each index \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq j \leq \text{max}(\text{abs}(a)) \)), \( b[j] \) contains the sum of \( a[i] \) for all \( i \) where \( \text{abs}(a[i]) = j \).
   - After updating \( b \), the function iterates through the first \( n \) elements of \( b \) and calculates a running total \( r \) by adding \( k \) and then subtracting each element of \( b \). If at any point \( r \) becomes less than the current element of \( b \), the function prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the input value for \( t \) (number of test cases).
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'.
   - The function ensures that the value of \( t \) is processed correctly and guarantees that the value of \( t \) is at least 0 after all iterations.

3. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The main function `if __name__ == '__main__':` calls `func_2()`, which in turn calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Both functions handle input and output as per the problem statement.
   - The logic in both functions is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given that both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and follow the problem statement, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
