Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It either returns None or calculates and returns the value of r which is calculated as k - 2 * b[1] + 2 * k.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters. Depending on the logic within the function, it either returns nothing (`None`) or computes and returns the value of `r` using the formula `k - 2 * b[1] + 2 * k`.
