Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `x`. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial state as it was not affected by the code.
