Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the third element of the list `x` to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` now holds the value of the third element in the list `x`.
