Let's break down the initial state and the expression for `profit` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is a list of integers where the third element (`x[2]`) is `b`.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `x` (`x[0]`).
   - `a` is the second element of the list `x` (`x[1]`).
   - `b` is the third element of the list `x` (`x[2]`).

2. **Expression for `profit`:**
   \[
   \text{profit} = n \times a + (b - a) \times (\min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - \min(n - 1, b - a) \times (\min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2
   \]
   - Let's denote `k = \min(n - 1, b - a)`.

3. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - The term \((\min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)\) can be written as \(k + 1\).
   - So, the expression becomes:
     \[
     \text{profit} = n \times a + (b - a) \times (k + 1) - k \times (k + 1) / 2
     \]

4. **Substituting `k` into the Expression:**
   - Since \(k = \min(n - 1, b - a)\), we need to consider two cases:
     - If \(n - 1 \leq b - a\), then \(k = n - 1\).
     - If \(b - a < n - 1\), then \(k = b - a\).

5. **Final Simplified Expression:**
   - For both cases, the expression simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{profit} = n \times a + (b - a) \times (k + 1) - k \times (k + 1) / 2
     \]
   - This is the final form of the profit calculation.

6. **Printing the Profit:**
   - The print statement will output the integer value of `profit`.

Given the above steps, the output will be the integer value of the calculated profit based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the list `x`.

Output: **int(n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2)**
