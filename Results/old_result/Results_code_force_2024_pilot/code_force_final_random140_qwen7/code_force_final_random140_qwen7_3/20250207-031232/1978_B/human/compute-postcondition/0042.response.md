Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with the third element being `b`, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2` if `a < b`, and `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)` if `a < b`.
