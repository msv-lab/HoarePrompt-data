Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0` since `t` is an input integer and the loop continues as long as `t` is non-zero.

2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

3. **Determine the adjustment needed**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) - 1, at the start of the loop, `t` is non-zero. However, after each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
