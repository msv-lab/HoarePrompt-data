You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17

    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        n = x[0]
        a = x[1]
        b = x[2]
        profit = n * a
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        t -= 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        n = x[0]
        
        a = x[1]
        
        b = x[2]
        
        profit = n * a
        
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, and the remaining variables (`x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `profit`, and `k`) are undefined because the loop has finished executing, and `t` is no longer greater than 0.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. At this point, no further inputs are processed, and the values of `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `profit`, and `k` are undefined as they were last updated within the loop body and are no longer relevant once the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates a profit based on the values of \( n \) and \( a \). If \( a \geq b \), it prints the initial profit \( n \times a \). Otherwise, it calculates a modified profit considering the difference \( b - a \) and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function outputs nothing and leaves all local variables undefined.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns according to the given rules. Let's break down the logic:

1. The program initializes `profit` to `n * a`, which is the total profit if no buns are sold at the modified price.
2. It then checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If so, the program directly prints the initial profit since selling at the usual price is more profitable.
3. If `a` is less than `b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` (the number of buns to sell at the modified price). The value of `k` is determined as `min(n - 1, b - a)`.
4. The program then updates the profit by adding the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and subtracting the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to `k`.

This logic ensures that the program considers all possible scenarios and calculates the maximum profit correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would make the program fail based on the provided logic and examples.
