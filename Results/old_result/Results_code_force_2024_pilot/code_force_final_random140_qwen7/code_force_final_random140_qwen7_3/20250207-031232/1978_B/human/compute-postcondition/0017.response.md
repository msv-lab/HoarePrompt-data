Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) - 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is either `n * a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, or `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2` if `a` is less than `b`, and `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.**

This means that the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables (`x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `profit`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
