### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - If \( a \geq b \), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - Otherwise, we should sell the first \( k \) buns at the modified price \( b - i + 1 \) and the rest at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It initializes the profit as \( n \times a \).
   - If \( a \geq b \), it prints the total profit without any modifications.
   - If \( a < b \), it calculates the optimal \( k \) as \( b - a \) and ensures \( k \) does not exceed \( n - 1 \).
   - It then updates the profit by adding the revenue from the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price and subtracting the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers (to account for the discount).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the profit when \( a < b \) is correct. The formula used to calculate the profit after selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price is accurate.
   - The condition \( k = \min(n - 1, k) \) ensures that \( k \) does not exceed the number of buns available minus one.
   - The final profit calculation and printing are done correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where \( a \geq b \) correctly by not modifying the profit.
   - It also handles the case where \( k \) might be zero, which means no buns are sold at the modified price.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to maximize Bob's profit based on the given conditions. Therefore, the code is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
