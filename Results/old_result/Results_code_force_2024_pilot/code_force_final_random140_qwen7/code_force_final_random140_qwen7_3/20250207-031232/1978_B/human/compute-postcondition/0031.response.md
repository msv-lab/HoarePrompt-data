Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is non-zero.

2. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be set to a value that is greater than 0 but still consistent with the operations performed within the loop.

Given the current state, `t` is `t - 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure `t` is set to a value that is greater than 0.

**State:**
- `t` must be greater than 0.

Since no other variables are involved in the loop condition, we don't need to adjust any other states.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
