Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with the third element being `b`, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2`, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `profit` by adding `(b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` to its current value, where `k` is defined as `min(n - 1, b - a)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
