The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates a profit based on the values of \( n \) and \( a \). If \( a \geq b \), it prints the initial profit \( n \times a \). Otherwise, it calculates a modified profit considering the difference \( b - a \) and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function outputs nothing and leaves all local variables undefined.
