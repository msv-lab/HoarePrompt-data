Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers where the second element is stored in `a`, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2`, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`**

Explanation: The code updates the `profit` variable by adding `(b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` to its current value, where `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `a`, `n`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
