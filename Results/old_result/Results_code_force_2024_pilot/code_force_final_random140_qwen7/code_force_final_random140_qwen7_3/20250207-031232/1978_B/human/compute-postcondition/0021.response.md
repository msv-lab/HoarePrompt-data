Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers where the second element is stored in `a`, `n` is the first element of the list `x`.**

Explanation: The code `a = x[1]` assigns the second element of the list `x` to the variable `a`. The first element of the list `x` remains stored in `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 is unchanged.
