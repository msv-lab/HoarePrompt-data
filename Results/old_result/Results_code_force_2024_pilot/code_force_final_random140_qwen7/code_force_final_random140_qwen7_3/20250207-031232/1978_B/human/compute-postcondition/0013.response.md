Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2`, `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`, and `a` is less than `b`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `profit` was initially defined as `n * a`.
- The code updates `profit` by adding `(b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`, where `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.
- Since `a` is less than `b`, `k` will be `n - 1` (because `n - 1` is less than `b - a`).
- Substituting `k` with `n - 1` in the equation, the updated `profit` becomes `n * a + (b - a) * ((n - 1) + 1) - (n - 1) * (n) / 2`.
- Simplifying, `profit` becomes `n * a + (b - a) * n - (n - 1) * n / 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
