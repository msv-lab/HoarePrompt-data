Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `n` is the first element of the list `x`.
- `a` is the second element of the list `x`.
- `b` is the third element of the list `x`.
- `profit` is calculated as `n * a`.

Given that the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to the current value of `b`, the `profit` is computed as `n * a`.

When the `print(profit)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `profit`, which is `n * a`.

Output: **n * a (where n is the first element of the list x and a is the second element of the list x)**
