Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function constructs the graph, performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \), and prints the result. The binary search is performed between 1 and \( n // k + 1 \).
   - **dfs**: This function performs a depth-first search to calculate the count of nodes that meet or exceed the minimum size requirement and those that do not.
   - **check**: This function uses the DFS to verify if it's possible to achieve the current \( x \) by checking if the conditions are met after removing edges.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` is correctly implemented to find the maximum \( x \). It adjusts the search range based on whether the current midpoint \( mid \) satisfies the condition (checked using `check(mid)`).

4. **DFS Functionality**:
   - The `dfs` function correctly counts nodes meeting the size requirement and those not meeting it.
   - The `check` function uses `dfs` to validate if the current \( x \) is feasible by ensuring both the count of nodes meeting the requirement and the number of components are sufficient.

5. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The program iterates over each test case, constructs the graph, and uses the binary search to find the maximum \( x \) for each test case.
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is optimal and within the constraints.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
