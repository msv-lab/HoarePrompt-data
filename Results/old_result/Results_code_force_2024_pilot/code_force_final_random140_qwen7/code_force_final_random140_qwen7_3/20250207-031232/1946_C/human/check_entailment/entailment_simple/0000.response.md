### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Edge List Construction**:
   - The program correctly parses the input and constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree.

2. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search is correctly initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. This ensures the search space covers all possible sizes of connected components.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The binary search loop correctly updates the search space based on whether it is possible to achieve a connected component size of `mid`.
   - The `check` function is called with the midpoint value `mid` to determine if it is feasible to have all remaining connected components of size at least `mid`.

4. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function correctly traverses the tree and counts the number of nodes that meet or exceed the minimum size requirement (`y`) and those that do not.
   - The function returns the necessary counts to update the binary search.

5. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to determine if it is possible to achieve the desired configuration with the current `x` value.
   - If the conditions are met (`ans >= x` and `r >= k`), the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

6. **Output**:
   - The final output is the lower bound of the binary search, which is the maximum size `x` that satisfies the conditions.

Given that the program follows the correct logic and the provided states match the expected behavior at each step, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
