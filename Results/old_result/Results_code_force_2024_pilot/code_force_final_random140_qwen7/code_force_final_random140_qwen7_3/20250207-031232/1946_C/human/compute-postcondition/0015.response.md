Postcondition: `r` is 0 + `rn` + 1 if `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, otherwise `r` is 0 + `rn` and `c` is `ans` + 1. `x` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, `y` is an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `visited` is a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal including the vertex `x`, and `node` is a vertex not in `visited`. `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the dfs function.
