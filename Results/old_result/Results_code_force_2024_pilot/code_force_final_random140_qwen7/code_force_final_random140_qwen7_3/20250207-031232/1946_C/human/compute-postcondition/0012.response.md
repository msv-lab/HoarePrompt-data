Postcondition: `r` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `x` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, `y` is an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `visited` is a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal including the vertex `x`, `node` is a vertex not in `visited`, `ans` is the result returned by the dfs function, and `rn` is the result returned by the dfs function. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `r` is updated to `0 + rn + 1` and `c` remains 1. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `0 + rn` and `c` is updated to `ans + 1`.
