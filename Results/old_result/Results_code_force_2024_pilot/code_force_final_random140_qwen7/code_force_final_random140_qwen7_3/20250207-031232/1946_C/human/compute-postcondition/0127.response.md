Functionality: **The function accepts a tree structure represented by an instance of the Tree class, a starting vertex `s`, and a minimum size `x` for each remaining connected component. It processes the tree to determine the total count of "good" components (where the size is greater than or equal to `x`) and the total size of remaining components for the starting vertex `s`. After processing, it returns these two values.**
