The function `dfs` takes two parameters, `x` (an integer representing a vertex in the tree) and `y` (an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges). It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree starting from vertex `x`. During this traversal, it calculates two values: `c` and `r`. The value `c` represents the total count of nodes that do not meet the minimum size requirement (`y`), while `r` represents the total count of nodes that meet or exceed the minimum size requirement (`y`). The function returns these two values as a tuple.
