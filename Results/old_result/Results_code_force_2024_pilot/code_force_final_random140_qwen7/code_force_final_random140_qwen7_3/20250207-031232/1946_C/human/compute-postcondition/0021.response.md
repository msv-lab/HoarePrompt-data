Postcondition: **`r` is `r` + `rn`, `c` is `ans` + 1, `x` is the same, `y` is the same, `g` is the same, `visited` is the same, `node` is the next neighbor of `x` not in `visited`. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `r` is incremented by `rn` + 1. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by `ans` + 1.**
