Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` is a list containing one tuple `(s, False)`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `good_components` is an empty dictionary, `remaining_size` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        good_components[v] = 0
        remaining_size[v] = 1
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    elif postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            good_components[v] += good_components[u]
            if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                good_components[v] += 1
            else:
                remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stack` contains tuples for all vertices in the subtree starting from `v`, with each tuple indicating a vertex that has not yet been processed (`False`). The `postorder` flag remains `False`, and the dictionaries `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated based on whether the `postorder` flag is `True` or `False`. If `postorder` is `True`, `good_components[s]` contains the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, plus 1 for each child `u` where `remaining_size[u] < x`. `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `s`. If `postorder` is `False`, no changes are made to `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `v` is the value popped from `stack`, `postorder` is True, and the dictionaries `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated according to the following rules: if `postorder` is False, the stack will contain all the children of `tree.vertices[v]` paired with `False`; otherwise, for each child `u` of `v`, if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `good_components[v]` is incremented by `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is updated to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `stack` will contain a list of tuples where each tuple consists of a vertex `u` from `tree.vertices[v].children` and the boolean value `False`, ensuring that every child is accounted for exactly once. If `postorder` is empty, `v`, `good_components[v]`, and `remaining_size[v]` remain in their final state as specified in the initial conditions. If `postorder` is non-empty, `v` remains unchanged, `good_components[v]` is updated to its original value plus the sum of 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x` for any `u`, or `good_components[u]` if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x` for any `u`. `remaining_size[v]` is updated to the sum of its original value and the values of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` that are children of `v`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
