Output State: **`stack` now contains one more element than before, which is (v, True), `v` is the value popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the boolean value popped from `stack`, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((v, True))` appends a tuple `(v, True)` to the `stack`. Since `v` was popped from the stack earlier, the stack now has one more element than before. The `postorder` and `good_components` and `remaining_size` variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
