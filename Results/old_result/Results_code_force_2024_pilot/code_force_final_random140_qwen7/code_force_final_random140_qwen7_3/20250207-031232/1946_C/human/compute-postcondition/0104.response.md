Postcondition: **`stack` is updated such that the last element (a tuple containing `v` and `postorder`) is removed; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple, and `postorder` is not an empty value, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element; `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`; `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`**
