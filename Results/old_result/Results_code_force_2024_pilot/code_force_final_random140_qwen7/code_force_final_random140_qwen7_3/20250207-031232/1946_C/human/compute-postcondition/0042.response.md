Postcondition: **All vertices in `tree.vertices[s]` have been processed. If `postorder` is `True`, `good_components[s]` contains the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, plus 1 for each child `u` where `remaining_size[u] < x`. `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `s`. If `postorder` is `False`, no changes are made to `good_components` and `remaining_size`.**
