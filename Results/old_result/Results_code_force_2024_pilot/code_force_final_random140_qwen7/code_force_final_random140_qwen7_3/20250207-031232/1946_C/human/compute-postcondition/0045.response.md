Output State: **`stack` now contains one less element than before, `v` is the value popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the boolean value popped from `stack`, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `v, postorder = stack.pop()` pops an element from the `stack` and assigns it to the tuple `(v, postorder)`. Since `stack` was not empty initially, it now contains one less element. The values of `v` and `postorder` are now known and are the last elements that were in the `stack`. The variables `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this operation.
