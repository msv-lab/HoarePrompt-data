Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` now contains one less element than before, `v` is the value popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the boolean value popped from `stack` and is currently True, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `good_components[v]` is increased by either 1 (if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`) or by `good_components[u]` (if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`). `postorder` remains True, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `good_components[v]' is updated to its previous value plus 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `good_components[v]'` is updated to its previous value plus the value of `good_components[u]'`, and `remaining_size[v]'` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `good_components[v]'` is now equal to the original value plus 1 if `remaining_size[u]'` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `good_components[v]'` is the original value plus `good_components[u]'`, and `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to `remaining_size[v]' + remaining_size[u]'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
