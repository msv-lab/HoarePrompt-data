Postcondition: `good_components[v]'` is the updated value which is now equal to the original value plus `good_components[u]'`, `remaining_size[v]'` is the updated value which is `remaining_size[v]' + remaining_size[u]'`, `u` is the next child of `v` in the tree. If `remaining_size[u]'` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]'` is unchanged and equals the original value plus 1.
