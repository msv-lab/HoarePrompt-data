Output State: **`good_components[v]' is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += 1` increases the value of `good_components[v]` by 1. Since the initial state only mentions that `good_components[v]' is increased by the value of `good_components[u]'`, and no specific value for `good_components[u]' is given, we directly increment `good_components[v]' by 1. The value of `good_components[u]'` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
