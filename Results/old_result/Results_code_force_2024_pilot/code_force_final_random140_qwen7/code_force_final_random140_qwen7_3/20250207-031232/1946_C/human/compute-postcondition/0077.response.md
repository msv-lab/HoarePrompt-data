Output State: **`good_components[v]'` is now equal to the original value of `good_components[v]'` plus 1, `remaining_size[v]'` is unchanged, `u` is the next child of `v` in the tree.**

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += 1` increments the value of `good_components[v]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
