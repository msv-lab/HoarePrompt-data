Output State: **`stack` now contains one more element than before, which is (v, True), `v` is 0, `postorder` is True, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets `good_components[v]` to 0. Given that `v` was the last value popped from `stack`, it is now specifically set to 0. All other variables (`stack`, `postorder`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
