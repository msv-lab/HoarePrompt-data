Output State: `good_components[v]` will be updated to its original value plus the sum of increments from all children vertices `u` of `v`. Specifically, for each child vertex `u`, if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` will be incremented by 1; otherwise, it will be incremented by `good_components[u]`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` will be updated to the sum of `remaining_size[v]` and `remaining_size[u]` for all children vertices `u` of `v`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `good_components[v]` will reflect the total count of vertices that meet the criteria across all descendants of `v`, and `remaining_size[v]` will reflect the cumulative `remaining_size` values of all descendants of `v`.
