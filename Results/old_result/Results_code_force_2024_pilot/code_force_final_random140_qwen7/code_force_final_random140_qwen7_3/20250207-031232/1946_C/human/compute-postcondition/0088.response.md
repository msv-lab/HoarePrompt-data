Output State: **`stack` is updated such that the last element is now a tuple containing `v` and `True`; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple; `good_components[v]` is 0; `remaining_size[v]` is 1.**

This means that the `remaining_size` variable for node `v` has been set to 1. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
