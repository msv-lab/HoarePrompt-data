Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function attempts to find the maximum number \( x \) using a binary search approach, but it does not properly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The initial range for the binary search (`l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`) might not cover all possible valid values of \( x \). For example, if \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 1 \), the maximum \( x \) could be 4, but the initial range only goes up to 2.

2. **Check Function Logic**: The `check` function is incomplete and does not correctly determine if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices. The function `dfs` is called with an argument `y`, which is not defined in the context of the problem.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function does not correctly count the number of connected components and their sizes after removing edges. It returns the count of nodes in a subtree and the number of nodes in subtrees that are large enough to meet the requirement, but it does not ensure that the removal of edges results in the desired connected components.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
