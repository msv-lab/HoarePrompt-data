Output State: **`r` is `ans` if `ans` >= `y` else `rn`; `c` is `ans` + 1; `x` is the same; `y` is the same; `g` is the same; `visited` is the same; `node` is the next neighbor of `x` not in `visited`; `ans` is the new value returned from dfs; `rn` is the new value returned from dfs.**

Explanation: The line `ans, rn = dfs(node, y)` calls the function `dfs` with arguments `node` and `y`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `ans` and `rn` respectively. This updates the values of `ans` and `rn`. The values of `r`, `c`, `x`, `y`, `g`, `visited`, and `node` remain unchanged from their previous states.
