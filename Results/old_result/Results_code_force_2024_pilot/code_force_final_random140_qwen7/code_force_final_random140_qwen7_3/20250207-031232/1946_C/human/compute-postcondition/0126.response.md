Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `tree`, which is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices and edges; `s`, which is an integer representing the starting vertex; and `x`, which is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function returns two values: `good_components[s]`, which is the total count of "good" components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children, and `remaining_size[s]`, which is the total size of remaining components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children.**
