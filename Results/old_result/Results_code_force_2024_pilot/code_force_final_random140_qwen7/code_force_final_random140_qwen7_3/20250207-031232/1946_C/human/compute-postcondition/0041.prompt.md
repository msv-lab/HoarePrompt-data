Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` is a list containing no elements, `v` is an integer equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `good_components` is an empty dictionary, `remaining_size` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `v` is an integer equal to `s`, `tree.vertices[v]` must have at least one child. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` equals `good_components[u] + 1` and `remaining_size[u]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` and `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `v` is `s`, `tree.vertices[v]` must have at least one child, `u` is the next child of `tree.vertices[v]`. If `remaining_size[u] >= x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `good_components[s]` is increased by either 1 (if `remaining_size[u] >= x`) or `good_components[u]` + `remaining_size[u]` (if `remaining_size[u] < x`). `remaining_size[s]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`. `v` is `s`, `tree.vertices[v]` must have at least one child, `u` is the next child of `tree.vertices[v]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
