The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b. The function returns information based on the number of vertices, the number of edges to be removed, and the list of edges. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges`, where `n` is the number of vertices, `k` is the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing edges in a tree. It returns information based on these inputs.**
