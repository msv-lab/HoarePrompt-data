Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

# Annotated Functions:
q = []
for i in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        edges.append((a, b))
    if i == 325:
        print(n, k, edges)
    func_1(n, k, edges)
for (n, k, edges) in q:
    func_1(n, k, edges)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, for every edge (a, b) in the `edges` list, both `g[a]` and `g[b]` will contain each other.
    c = 0
    visited = set()
    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `c` is still 0, `visited` is still an empty set, and both `l` and `r` will converge to the same value which is the result of the binary search performed by the loop.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: the result of the binary search
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, performs a binary search to find a specific value, and prints the result of the binary search. The function does not return any value but prints the outcome of the binary search.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, y is an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. g is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and visited is a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal.
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: Output State: `r` is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`. `c` is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`. `x` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, `y` is an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `visited` is a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal including the vertex `x`, and `node` is a vertex not in `visited`. `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the dfs function.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `r` will be the total count of nodes that meet or exceed the minimum size requirement (`y`), plus the sum of counts of nodes that do not meet the requirement but were still processed. `c` will be the total count of nodes that do not meet the minimum size requirement. The variables `x`, `y`, `g`, `visited`, and the way the loop processes `node` remain as described.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `c`, which is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`, and `r`, which is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` takes two parameters, `x` (an integer representing a vertex in the tree) and `y` (an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges). It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree starting from vertex `x`. During this traversal, it calculates two values: `c` and `r`. The value `c` represents the total count of nodes that do not meet the minimum size requirement (`y`), while `r` represents the total count of nodes that meet or exceed the minimum size requirement (`y`). The function returns these two values as a tuple.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the size of each remaining connected component, visited is a set initialized to keep track of visited nodes, and dfs is a function that performs a depth-first search to determine if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that each remaining connected component has at least x vertices.
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: `visited` is an empty set, `ans` is the result of the dfs function call with parameters (1, x), `r` is the second return value of the dfs function call with parameters (1, x). Either `ans` is less than `x` or `r` is less than `k`
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check(x)` accepts an integer `x` and determines whether it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges from a graph such that each remaining connected component contains at least `x` vertices. If this condition can be met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
