You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0
    visited = set()


    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

#Function 2:
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            (ans, rn) = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
    return (c, r)

#Function 3:
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    (ans, r) = dfs(1, x)
    if ans >= x and r >= k:
        return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `check(x)` accepts an integer `x` and determines whether it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges from a graph such that each remaining connected component contains at least `x` vertices. If this condition can be met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function attempts to find the maximum number \( x \) using a binary search approach, but it does not properly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The initial range for the binary search (`l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`) might not cover all possible valid values of \( x \). For example, if \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 1 \), the maximum \( x \) could be 4, but the initial range only goes up to 2.

2. **Check Function Logic**: The `check` function is incomplete and does not correctly determine if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices. The function `dfs` is called with an argument `y`, which is not defined in the context of the problem.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function does not correctly count the number of connected components and their sizes after removing edges. It returns the count of nodes in a subtree and the number of nodes in subtrees that are large enough to meet the requirement, but it does not ensure that the removal of edges results in the desired connected components.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
