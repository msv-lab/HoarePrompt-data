Output State: **`stack` is updated such that the last element (a tuple containing `v` and `postorder`) is removed; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple, and `postorder` is not an empty value, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element; `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`.**

This means that the `good_components[v]` variable has been incremented by the value of `good_components[u]`, while all other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
