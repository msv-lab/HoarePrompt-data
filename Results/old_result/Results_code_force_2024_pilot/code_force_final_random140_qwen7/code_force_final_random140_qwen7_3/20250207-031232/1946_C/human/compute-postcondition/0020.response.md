Output State: **`r` is `r` + `rn`, `c` is `ans` + 1, `x` is the same, `y` is the same, `g` is the same, `visited` is the same, `node` is the next neighbor of `x` not in `visited`, `c` is now `c + ans`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ans` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ans`. The other variables (`r`, `rn`, `x`, `y`, `g`, `visited`, and `node`) remain unchanged.
