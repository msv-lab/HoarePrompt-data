Output State: **`good_components[v]'` is the updated value which is now equal to the original value plus `good_components[u]'`, `remaining_size[v]'` is the updated value which is `remaining_size[v]' + remaining_size[u]'`, `u` is the next child of `v` in the tree.**

Explanation: The code updates `remaining_size[v]` by adding the value of `remaining_size[u]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
