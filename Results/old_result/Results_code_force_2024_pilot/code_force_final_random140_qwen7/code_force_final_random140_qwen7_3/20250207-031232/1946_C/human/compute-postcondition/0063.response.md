Output State: **`good_components[v]` is increased by 1, `good_components[u]` remains unchanged, `postorder` is True, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element, the current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += 1` increases the value of `good_components[v]` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
