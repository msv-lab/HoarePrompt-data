Postcondition: `good_components[v]` is increased by either 1 (if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`) or by `good_components[u]` (if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`). `postorder` remains True, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element.
