Output State: **`ans` is the result of the dfs function call with arguments `node` and `y`; `r` is `r + rn`.**

Explanation: The code `r += rn` adds the value of `rn` to the current value of `r`. The variables `ans` and `rn` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `ans` is still the result of the dfs function call with arguments `node` and `y`, and `r` is updated to be its original value plus `rn`.
