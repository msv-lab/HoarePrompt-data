Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x` (an integer representing a vertex in the tree), `y` (an integer representing the required minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges). It returns a tuple containing two values: `c`, which is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`, and `r`, which is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.**
