Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for node in g[x]`. The variables involved in the loop head are `node` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each `node` in the adjacency list `g[x]`. There are no explicit conditions given in the loop itself that would affect the continuation of the loop, other than the fact that it continues as long as there are nodes in `g[x]`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - The variable `x` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The variable `node` changes with each iteration, but its initial value is determined by the current state of `g[x]`.
   - The variables `y`, `g`, `visited`, and `r` are not part of the loop head and thus their values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given that the loop continues as long as there are nodes in `g[x]`, and since `x` does not change, the only variable that changes is `node`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `x` remains the same.
- `node` will be the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]`.

Since `y`, `g`, `visited`, and `r` remain unchanged, we don't need to modify their states.

**Final State:**
State: **`x` remains the same, `node` is the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]`, `y`, `g`, `visited`, and `r` remain the same**.
