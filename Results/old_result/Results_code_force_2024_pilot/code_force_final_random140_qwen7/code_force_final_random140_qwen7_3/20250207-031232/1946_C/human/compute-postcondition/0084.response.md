Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while stack:`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `stack`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `v` is the value popped from `stack`.
   - `postorder` is `True`.
   - The dictionaries `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated based on certain conditions.

4. **Adjusting the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `stack` must not be empty. Since `v` was just popped from `stack`, `stack` must still contain some elements.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `stack` to ensure it is not empty.

**State:**
**`v` is the value popped from `stack`, `postorder` is True, and `stack` must not be empty.**
