Output State: **The program returns two values: `good_components[s]`, which is the total count of "good" components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children, and `remaining_size[s]`, which is the total size of remaining components for the starting vertex `s`, considering its children.**

This means that after processing all vertices in the tree, the function returns the count of "good" components and the size of the remaining components for the starting vertex `s`. The "good" components are those with a size greater than or equal to `x`, and the remaining size considers the sizes of all connected components after removing `k` edges.
