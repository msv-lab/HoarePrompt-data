You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, for every edge (a, b) in the `edges` list, both `g[a]` and `g[b]` will contain each other.
    c = 0
    visited = set()
    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `c` is still 0, `visited` is still an empty set, and both `l` and `r` will converge to the same value which is the result of the binary search performed by the loop.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: the result of the binary search
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges`, where `n` is the number of vertices, `k` is the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing edges in a tree. It returns information based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
