Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` is updated such that the last element (a tuple containing `v` and `postorder`) is removed; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple, and `postorder` is not an empty value, and `postorder` is a non-empty value
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stack` is updated such that the last element (a tuple containing `v` and `postorder`) is removed; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple, and `postorder` is not an empty value, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element; `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`; if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` equals `good_components[u] + 1` and `remaining_size[u]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` and `remaining_size[u]` is reset to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `good_components[v]' is increased by either 1 (if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`), or by the value of `good_components[u]'` and `remaining_size[v]'` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]'` (if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `good_components[v]'` is updated to its original value plus 1 if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `good_components[v]'` is updated to its original value plus `good_components[u]'`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]'` is now equal to the original value of `remaining_size[v]'` plus the value of `remaining_size[u]'`. `u` is the next child vertex of `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
