Output State: **`stack` is updated such that the last element is now a tuple containing `v` and `True`; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((v, True))` appends a new tuple `(v, True)` to the stack. Here, `v` is the first element of the removed tuple from the previous state, and `True` is the second element. The `postorder` variable remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
