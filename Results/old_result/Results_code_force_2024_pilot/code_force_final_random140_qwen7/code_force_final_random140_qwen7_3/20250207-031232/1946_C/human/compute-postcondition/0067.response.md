Postcondition: `good_components[v]` is increased by either 1 or `good_components[u]`, depending on whether `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. `postorder` remains True, `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element. Additionally, if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, then `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `remaining_size[u] + original_remaining_size[v]`.
