Postcondition: **`stack` is updated such that the last element (a tuple containing `v` and `postorder`) is removed; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple, and `postorder` is not an empty value, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element; `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`; if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` equals `good_components[u] + 1` and `remaining_size[u]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` and `remaining_size[u]` is reset to 0.**
