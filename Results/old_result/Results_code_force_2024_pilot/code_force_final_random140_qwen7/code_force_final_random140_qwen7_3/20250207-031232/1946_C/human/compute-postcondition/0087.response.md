Output State: **`stack` is updated such that the last element is now a tuple containing `v` and `True`; `v` is the first element of the removed tuple; `postorder` is the second element of the removed tuple; `good_components[v]` is 0.**

This means that the value of `good_components[v]` has been set to 0, while the structure of the `stack` remains unchanged with the last element being a tuple containing `v` and `True`. The values of `v` and `postorder` remain the same as they were before the assignment to `good_components[v]`.
