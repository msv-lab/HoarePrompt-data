Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `u` and `v`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `u` for each vertex `v` in the tree.

3. **Determine the state changes within the loop**: 
   - `good_components[v]'` is updated based on the value of `remaining_size[u]'` and `good_components[u]'`.
   - `remaining_size[v]'` is updated based on the value of `remaining_size[u]'`.

4. **Analyze the postcondition**:
   - If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]'` is updated to its previous value plus 1.
   - Otherwise, `good_components[v]'` is updated to its previous value plus the value of `good_components[u]'`, and `remaining_size[v]'` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]'`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the state was such that `good_components[v]'` was updated according to the given conditions.
   - For the next iteration, `u` will be the next child of `v` in the tree.

Given this analysis, the relevant states to adjust for the next iteration are `u` (which will be the next child of `v`) and the updated values of `good_components[v]'` and `remaining_size[v]'`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- `v` remains the same as it is the outer variable of the loop.
- `u` will be the next child of `v` in the tree.
- `good_components[v]'` will be the updated value from the previous iteration.
- `remaining_size[v]'` will be the updated value from the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`good_components[v]'` is the updated value, `remaining_size[v]'` is the updated value, `u` is the next child of `v` in the tree**.
