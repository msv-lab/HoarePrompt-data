Output State: **`good_components[v]'` is updated to its original value plus `good_components[u]'`; `remaining_size[v]'` is now equal to the original value of `remaining_size[v]'` plus the value of `remaining_size[u]'`; `u` is the next child vertex of `v`.**

This means that the value of `remaining_size[v]` has been updated to include the value of `remaining_size[u]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
