Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: 
   - The binary search implementation is incomplete and does not correctly determine the maximum value `x`. The `check` function is not properly integrated into the binary search loop.
   
2. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is not correctly implemented. It should count the size of each connected component and ensure that the size of each component is at least `y`. However, the current implementation does not accurately count the sizes of the connected components after removing edges.

3. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function is not correctly designed to verify if the tree can be split into components of size at least `x` after removing `k` edges. It should use the `dfs` function to explore the tree and count the sizes of the resulting components.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle edge cases where the tree structure might lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with small trees or specific configurations of edges.

To fix these issues, you would need to:
- Properly implement the binary search to find the maximum `x`.
- Correctly implement the `dfs` function to count the sizes of connected components after removing edges.
- Ensure the `check` function correctly verifies the conditions for the given `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the approach:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def dfs(x, y, g, visited, parent):
    visited.add(x)
    size = 1
    for node in g[x]:
        if node != parent and node not in visited:
            size += dfs(node, y, g, visited, x)
    if size >= y:
        return size
    else:
        return float('inf')

def check(x, k, g):
    visited = set()
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, len(g) + 1):
        if i not in visited:
            size = dfs(i, x, g, visited, -1)
            if size < x:
                return False
            count += 1
    return count >= k

def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    
    l, r = 1, n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid, k, g):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    return r

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
    print(func_1(n, k, edges))
```

This corrected version uses a more straightforward approach to find the maximum `x` by leveraging binary search and DFS to verify the conditions.
