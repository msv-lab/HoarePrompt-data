Postcondition: `good_components[v]'` is now equal to the original value plus 1 if `remaining_size[u]'` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `good_components[v]'` is the original value plus `good_components[u]'`, and `remaining_size[v]'` is updated to `remaining_size[v]' + remaining_size[u]'`.
