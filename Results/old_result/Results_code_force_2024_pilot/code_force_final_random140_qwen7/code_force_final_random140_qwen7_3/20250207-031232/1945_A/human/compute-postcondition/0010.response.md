Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `line` is the next line from the input, `p` is the first integer from the new line, `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the new line, `r` is the third integer from the new line**.

Explanation: The code `p, q, r = map(int, line.split())` splits the string `line` into three integers based on spaces and assigns them to `p`, `q`, and `r` respectively. Specifically, `p` is assigned the first integer, `q` is assigned the sum of the second and third integers, and `r` is assigned the third integer. The other variables (`t` and `line`) remain unchanged.
