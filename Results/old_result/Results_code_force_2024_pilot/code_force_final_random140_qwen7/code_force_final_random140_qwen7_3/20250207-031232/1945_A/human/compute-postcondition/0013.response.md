Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `line` is the last line from the input; `p` is the first integer from the last line; `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the last line plus the third integer from the last line; `r` is the third integer from the last line.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variable `line` will hold the last line of input read from the file. The variable `p` will be set to the first integer from this last line, `q` will be the sum of the second and third integers from this line plus the third integer itself, and `r` will be the third integer from this last line.
