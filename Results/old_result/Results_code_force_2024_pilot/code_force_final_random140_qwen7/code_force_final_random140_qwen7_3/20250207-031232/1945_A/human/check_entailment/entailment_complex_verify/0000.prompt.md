You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

        q += r
        
        print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `line` is the last line from the input; `p` is the first integer from the last line; `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the last line plus the third integer from the last line; `r` is the third integer from the last line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value indicating the optimal seating arrangement based on the given numbers. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the accommodation of participants based on their preferences. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two others, and it incorrectly calculates the number of tents required.

Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. The program reads the input values `p`, `q`, and `r` which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
2. It then adds the number of universals (`r`) to the number of extroverts (`q`), effectively treating all universals as potential roommates for extroverts.
3. It checks if the number of universals is less than the remainder when `q` (extroverts plus universals) is divided by 3. If true, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone. Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents as `p - q // 3`.

This approach is flawed because:
- It does not ensure that each extrovert gets a tent with exactly two others.
- It does not properly account for the remaining participants after assigning tents to introverts and extroverts with universals.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1 2 3
```
- There is 1 introvert who needs a tent alone, requiring 1 tent.
- There are 2 extroverts who need a tent with 2 others, but there are only 3 universals available, which is enough to pair with both extroverts, requiring 1 additional tent.
- Therefore, the total number of tents needed is 2.

However, the program outputs `-1` for this case, which is incorrect.

Another example:
```
1 4 1
```
- There is 1 introvert who needs a tent alone, requiring 1 tent.
- There are 4 extroverts who need a tent with 2 others, but there is only 1 universal available, which is not enough to pair with all 4 extroverts.
- Therefore, it is impossible to accommodate all participants, and the correct output should be `-1`.

The program fails to handle these cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
