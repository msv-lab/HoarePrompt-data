Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over lines from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`.
   - This means each iteration processes one line from the input.

2. **Understand the Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `q` is increased by `r`.
   - `p` is the first integer from the current line.
   - `q` is the second integer from the current line plus `r`.
   - `r` is the third integer from the current line.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be another line available to process.
   - After processing the current line, `p` becomes the first integer of the next line, `q` becomes the second integer of the next line plus `r`, and `r` becomes the third integer of the next line.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `p` will be the first integer from the next line.
   - `q` will be the second integer from the next line plus `r`.
   - `r` will be the third integer from the next line.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `p` is the first integer from the next line.
- `q` is the second integer from the next line plus `r`.
- `r` is the third integer from the next line.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `p` is the first integer from the next line; `q` is the second integer from the next line plus `r`; `r` is the third integer from the next line.**
