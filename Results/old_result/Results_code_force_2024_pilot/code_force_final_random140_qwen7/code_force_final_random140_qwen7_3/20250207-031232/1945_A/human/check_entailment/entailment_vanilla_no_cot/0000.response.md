Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the participants based on their preferences. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program incorrectly combines the number of extroverts and universals into `q + r` and then tries to use this combined value to determine the number of tents. This approach does not account for the specific requirements of each group of participants.

2. **Handling Introverts**: The program subtracts `q // 3` from `p` to account for the number of tents needed for introverts. However, it does not correctly handle the remainder (`q % 3`). Specifically, it incorrectly checks if `r < q % 3` to decide whether to print `-1`.

3. **Calculation of Tents**: The logic to calculate the number of tents should consider the following:
   - Each introvert needs 1 tent.
   - Extroverts need 1 tent when paired with 2 others, which means every 3 participants (1 extrovert and 2 others) need 1 tent.
   - Universals can share tents with anyone, so they can be used to fill any remaining spots in the tents.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, line.split())
        total_people = a + b + c
        tents_for_introverts = a
        # Calculate the number of full tents needed for extroverts and universals
        full_tents_needed = (b + c + 2) // 3
        # Calculate the remaining people after accounting for full tents
        remaining_people = total_people - (full_tents_needed * 3)
        # Check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots
        if remaining_people <= c:
            total_tents = tents_for_introverts + full_tents_needed
        else:
            total_tents = -1
        print(total_tents)
```

This corrected version properly calculates the number of tents needed while respecting the constraints and preferences of each group of participants.
