Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case consists of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, the function returns a value indicating how these individuals can be optimally seated.**

Note: The exact nature of the return value (e.g., a specific seating arrangement or a score) is not detailed in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the processing of the input data.
