Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `line` is the next line from the input.
   - `p` is the first integer from the new line.
   - `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the new line plus the third integer from the new line.
   - `r` is the third integer from the new line.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - We need to determine the value of `q` first.
     - Let the integers from the new line be `a`, `b`, and `c`.
     - Therefore, `q = b + c + c = b + 2c`.
   - Now, let's evaluate the expression inside the print statement.
     - `q // 3` is the integer division of `q` by 3.
     - `q % 3` is the remainder when `q` is divided by 3.
     - The expression `(p - q // 3, -1)` creates a tuple with two elements: `p - q // 3` and `-1`.
     - The condition `r < q % 3` checks if `r` is less than the remainder of `q` divided by 3.
       - If `r < q % 3` is true, the expression evaluates to the first element of the tuple (`p - q // 3`).
       - If `r < q % 3` is false, the expression evaluates to the second element of the tuple (`-1`).

4. **Possible Values**:
   - Since `r` is the third integer from the new line (`c`), and `q % 3` is the remainder when `b + 2c` is divided by 3, `r < q % 3` depends on the values of `b` and `c`.
   - Without specific values for `b` and `c`, we cannot determine the exact value of `q % 3`, but we can consider both cases:
     - If `r < q % 3` is true, the output will be `p - q // 3`.
     - If `r < q % 3` is false, the output will be `-1`.

Given the general nature of the problem and the lack of specific values for `b` and `c`, the most precise answer we can give is based on the condition.

Output: **(p - (b + 2c) // 3, -1)[c < (b + 2c) % 3]**
