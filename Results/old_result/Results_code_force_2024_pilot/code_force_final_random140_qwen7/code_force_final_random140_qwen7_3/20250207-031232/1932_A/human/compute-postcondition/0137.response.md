Postcondition: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character, `ret` is either 2 if `i == '@'`, or 1 otherwise, `thorn` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i == '*'` was met (with `thorn` set to 2 if `i == '*'`), and `i` is the second character in the list `s`.
