You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
During your journey through computer universes, you stumbled upon a very
interesting world. It is a path with n consecutive cells, each of which can
either be empty, contain thorns, or a coin. In one move, you can move one or
two cells along the path, provided that the destination cell does not contain
thorns (and belongs to the path). If you move to the cell with a coin, you
pick it up.

Here, green arrows correspond to legal moves, and the red arrow corresponds to
an illegal move.

You want to collect as many coins as possible. Find the maximum number of
coins you can collect in the discovered world if you start in the leftmost
cell of the path.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the length of the path.

The second line of each test case contains a string of n characters, the
description of the path. The character '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes
a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. It is guaranteed that
the first cell is empty.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer, the maximum number of coins you
can collect.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10
    
    .@@*@.**@@
    
    5
    
    .@@@@
    
    15
    
    .@@..@***..@@@*

Output

    3
    4
    3

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        len = int(input())
        s = list(input())
        ret = 0
        thorn = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == '@':
                thorn = 0
                ret += 1
            elif i == '*':
                thorn += 1
                if thorn == 2:
                    break
            else:
                thorn = 0
        print(ret)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. Additionally, the first cell is guaranteed to be empty ('.') and does not contain thorns.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        len = int(input())
        
        s = list(input())
        
        ret = 0
        
        thorn = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == '@':
                thorn = 0
                ret += 1
            elif i == '*':
                thorn += 1
                if thorn == 2:
                    break
            else:
                thorn = 0
        
        print(ret)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ret` will contain the total count of '@' characters encountered in the string `s`. The variable `thorn` will be 0, as the loop breaks when `thorn` reaches 2, resetting it back to 0. The variable `i` will be the last character processed in the string `s`, and `len` will be the length of the final string `s` after any necessary adjustments within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for moving along the path and collecting coins. Specifically, the program does not account for the ability to move two cells forward if the middle cell is not a thorn. This leads to incorrect results in scenarios where skipping one cell is necessary to avoid thorns and collect more coins.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
.@@*@.**@@
```
The correct output should be `3`, but the program will incorrectly output `2` because it does not handle the case where the second cell is skipped to avoid the thorn and collect the coin in the fourth cell.

To fix this, the program needs to include logic to check both one-step and two-step moves while ensuring the destination cell does not contain thorns.
