Postcondition: `s` is an iterable with at least 5 elements, `i` is the 5th element of `s`, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 3, or 0 depending on the value of `i`, and `ret` is incremented by 1 if `i` is `'@'`, otherwise `ret` remains the same as the previous iteration. If `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
