Postcondition: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least two characters remaining, `ret` is 2 if the third character equals '@', otherwise `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 3 if the third character equals '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0, and `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `thorn` does not equal 2, the same conditions hold as the precondition.
