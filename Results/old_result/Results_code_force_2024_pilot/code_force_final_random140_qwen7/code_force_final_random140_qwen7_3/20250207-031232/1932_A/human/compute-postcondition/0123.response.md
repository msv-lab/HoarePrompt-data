Postcondition: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character, `ret` is 0, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, and `i` is not '@'. If the first character `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.
