Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `i` is the variable that will take each character from the list `s` one by one.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `s`. 

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `s` is a list of characters, we need to ensure that the list `s` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start iterating over the characters in the list `s`, so initially, `i` should be set to the first character in the list.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `len` is an input integer, which is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `ret` is 0, which is also not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `thorn` is 0, which is also not directly related to the loop execution.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must have at least one character (i.e., `s` is not empty).
- `i` must be the first character in the list `s`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`s` is a non-empty list of characters, `i` is the first character in the list `s`**.
