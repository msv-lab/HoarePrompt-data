Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` which iterates over the list `s`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the list `s` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `i` is the second character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` is either 1, 3, or 0 based on the value of `i`.

4. **Analyze the possible values of `i` and their impact on `thorn`**:
   - If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 1.
   - If `i` is '*', `thorn` is either 3 or 1.
   - If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is 0.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second character in the list `s`, the next character in the list (which will be `i` in the next iteration) must be the third character in the list `s`.
   - The value of `thorn` will depend on the value of this new `i`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `s` must still be a list of characters with at least one character.
- `i` must now be the third character in the list `s`.
- `thorn` will be determined by the value of the third character in the list `s` according to the given conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is either 1, 3, or 0 based on the value of the third character in the list `s`.**
