Postcondition: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the first character in the list `s` and its value is '@'. If the first character `i` is not '@', then `thorn` is 0. If the first character `i` is '*', then `thorn` is set to 2. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.
