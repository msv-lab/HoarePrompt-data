Postcondition: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 0 based on the value of the third character in the list `s`. If the third character is '@', `thorn` is 1. If the third character is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1 based on its current value (either 1 or 0). If `thorn` equals 2, the loop is exited. Otherwise, `thorn` remains unchanged.**
