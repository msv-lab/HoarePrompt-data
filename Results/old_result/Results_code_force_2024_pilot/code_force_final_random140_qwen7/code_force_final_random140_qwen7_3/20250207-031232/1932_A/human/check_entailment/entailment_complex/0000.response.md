Reasoning:
- The function `func()` correctly processes each test case by iterating over the string representation of the path.
- It initializes `ret` to count the number of coins (`@`) collected and `thorn` to track the number of consecutive thorns (`*`) encountered.
- When a coin (`@`) is encountered, it resets `thorn` to 0 and increments `ret`.
- When a thorn (`*`) is encountered, it increments `thorn` and checks if `thorn` has reached 2, at which point it breaks out of the loop, effectively stopping further processing of the string for that test case.
- The function prints the value of `ret` for each test case, which is the maximum number of coins that can be collected without encountering two consecutive thorns.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
