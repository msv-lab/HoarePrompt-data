Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - We know that the loop has already executed for 4 times.
   - This means that the variable `i` has taken on 4 different values from the iterable `s`.
   - Since the loop has executed 4 times, the length of `s` must be at least 4 (it could be more, but it cannot be less).

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop execution**:
   - The variable `i` would have taken on the first 4 elements of `s`.
   - The variable `s` itself remains unchanged by the loop.

4. **Consider the given information**:
   - `len` is an input integer, which is the length of the iterable `s`.
   - `ret` is 0, which is not directly relevant to the loop head but might be part of the loop body.
   - `thorn` is 0, which is also not directly relevant to the loop head but might be part of the loop body.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - Since the loop has executed 4 times, `s` must have at least 4 elements.
   - The variable `i` would have taken on the first 4 elements of `s`, but since we don't know the exact values of `s`, we just need to ensure that `s` has at least 4 elements.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`len` must be at least 4, `s` is an iterable with at least 4 elements, `i` has taken on the first 4 elements of `s`**.
