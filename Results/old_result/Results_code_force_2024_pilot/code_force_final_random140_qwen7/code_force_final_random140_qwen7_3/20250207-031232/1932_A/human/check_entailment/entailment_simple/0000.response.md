Reasoning:
- The program iterates over each character in the input string `s` for each test case.
- It counts the number of coins (`@`) encountered while ensuring that the path does not encounter two consecutive thorns (`*`).
- When a thorn is encountered, a counter `thorn` is incremented. If this counter reaches 2, the loop breaks, preventing further movement.
- The variable `ret` keeps track of the total number of coins collected.
- The logic correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the path does not encounter two consecutive thorns, which would make the move illegal.
- The program correctly outputs the total number of coins collected for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to be correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
