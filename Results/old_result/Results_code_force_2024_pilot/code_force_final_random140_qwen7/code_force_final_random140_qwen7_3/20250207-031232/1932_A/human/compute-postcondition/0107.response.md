Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. Here, the objects involved are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `i` is the variable that will take on each character in the list `s` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop depends on the list `s` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `s` has at least one character.
   - The variable `i` will start as the first character in the list `s`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `s` must be a list of characters with at least one character.
- `i` will be the first character in the list `s`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the first character in the list `s`**
