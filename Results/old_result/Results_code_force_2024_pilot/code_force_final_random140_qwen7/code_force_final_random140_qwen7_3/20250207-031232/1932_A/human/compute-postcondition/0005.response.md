Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `i` will take each character from the list `s` in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `s`.
   - The variable `i` will be assigned the value of each element in the list `s` one by one.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each character in the list `s`, the list `s` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will be assigned the value of the first character in the list `s` when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must have at least one character.
- `i` should be set to the first character in the list `s`.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `thorn` is 0, `ret` is 0, `i` is the first character in the list `s`**.

However, since the question specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we focus on `s` and `i`.

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `i` is the first character in the list `s`**.
