Postcondition: `s` is an iterable with at least 4 elements, `i` is the 6th element of `s`. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0 and `ret` is the value of the previous iteration plus 1. Otherwise, `thorn` is either `thorn` + 1 (if `i` equals '*' and `thorn` is not 2 yet) or 0 (if `i` does not equal '*'), and `ret` remains the same as the previous iteration.
