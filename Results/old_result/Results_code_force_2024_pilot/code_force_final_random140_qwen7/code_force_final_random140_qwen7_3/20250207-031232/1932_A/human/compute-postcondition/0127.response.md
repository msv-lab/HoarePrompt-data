Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `len` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character.
   - `ret` is 1.
   - `thorn` is 0.
   - `i` is the first character in the list `s`, and `i` is '@'.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the list `s`.
   - The variable `i` is used to represent the current character being processed.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the list `s`.
   - Since `i` was initially set to the first character (`'@'`), the next character in the list `s` will be the second character.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `len` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains the same list of characters.
   - `ret` remains 1 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `thorn` remains 0 unless the next character `i` is either '*' or not '@'.
   - `i` will now be the second character in the list `s`.

5. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - If the second character `i` is not '@', then `thorn` will be updated based on the value of `i`.
     - If `i` is '*', then `thorn` becomes 2.
     - Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least one character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the second character in the list `s`**.
