Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` as input. It processes `x` through a series of conditional checks involving arrays `a` and `b`. Depending on the values and operations defined in `a`, `x` is modified through modulo operations. The function ultimately returns the value at index `x` in array `b`, or the value at index `a[2 * i + 1]` in array `b` if `x` is reduced to 0 during the processing.**
