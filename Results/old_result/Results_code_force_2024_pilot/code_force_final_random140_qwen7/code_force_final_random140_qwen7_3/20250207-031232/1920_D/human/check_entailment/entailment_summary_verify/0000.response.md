### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `a` as `[0]` instead of an empty list. This is incorrect because the array should start as an empty list.

2. **Handling Operations**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `b` to store some intermediate values, but it does not correctly simulate the array formation process. Specifically, it does not append elements or handle the doubling operation as described in the problem statement.
   - The logic to append elements and handle the doubling operation is flawed. For example, when `d == 1`, it increments the last element of `a` by 1, which is not the correct way to append an element to the array. When `d == 2`, it appends `a[-1] * (e + 1)` to `a`, which is also incorrect because it does not handle the doubling of the array correctly.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is supposed to find the k-th element in the final array, but it does not correctly simulate the array formation process. Instead, it tries to reverse the array and use a dictionary to map indices, which is not necessary and leads to incorrect results.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1(x)` is designed to find the k-th element in the final array. However, the program does not correctly simulate the array formation process. The function `func_1(x)` is supposed to handle the operations and queries correctly, but the program's implementation is flawed.

#### Example Case Analysis:
- Consider the first test case:
  - After the first operation, the array should be `[1]`.
  - After the second operation, the array should be `[1, 2]`.
  - After the third operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2]`.
  - After the fourth operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - After the fifth operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

- The program does not correctly simulate these steps. For example, after the fifth operation, the array should contain 20 elements, but the program does not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the array formation process and handle the operations and queries as described in the problem statement.
