#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers representing the results of Jayden's operations on the array a, where each element in x indicates either appending an integer or appending multiple copies of the current array. Additionally, there are q integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_q (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^{18}, c)), where c is the size of the array after all operations, representing the queries for the k-th element of the final array a.
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the element at index x in list b, where x is an integer representing the size of the final array after all operations and is present in the list b.
    #State: `x` is an integer representing the size of the final array after all operations, and `x` is not in the list `b`
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: Output State: The function has either returned an element from list `b` at index `x` or returned None if `x` is never found in list `b`.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop's behavior, it will continue to update `x` based on the formula `x = (x - 1) % i + 1` for each iteration, where `i` is an element from the list `a`. If at any point `x` matches an index in list `b`, the function returns the corresponding value from `b`. Since the loop continues until `x` matches an index in `b` or all iterations are completed, the final output will be either a value from `b` or `None` if no such match is found during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `x`, which is an integer. It then checks if `x` is present in list `b`. If `x` is found in `b`, it returns the element at index `x` from `b`. If `x` is not found in `b`, it iterates through the list `a`, updating `x` using the formula `x = (x - 1) % i + 1` for each element `i` in `a`. If during this process, `x` becomes an index present in `b`, it returns the corresponding element from `b`. If no such index is found, it returns `None`.
