Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers: the first integer represents an operation type (1 or 2), and the second integer represents the value or the number of copies for the operation. After performing all operations on a list or array named `b`, the function returns the value at the index specified by the final value of `x` in `b`. If `x` becomes 0 during the operations, the function returns the value at the index `a[2 * i + 1]` in `b`.**
