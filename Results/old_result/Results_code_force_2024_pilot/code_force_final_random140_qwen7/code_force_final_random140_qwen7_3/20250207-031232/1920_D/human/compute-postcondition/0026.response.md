Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `f` is the same as before, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. No variables are updated or assigned new values by this statement. The conditions and values of `i`, `f`, and the array `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
