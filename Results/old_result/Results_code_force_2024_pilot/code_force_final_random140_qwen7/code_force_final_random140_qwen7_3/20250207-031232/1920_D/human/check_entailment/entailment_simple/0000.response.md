### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes an array `a` with a single element `[0]` and a dictionary `b` to store certain values.
   - It then reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`.

2. **Processing Operations:**
   - The program iterates through each operation.
   - If the last element of `a` exceeds \(10^{19}\), it skips the operation.
   - If the operation type `d` is odd, it increments the last element of `a` by 1 and stores the new value in `b`.
   - If the operation type `d` is even, it appends the last element of `a` multiplied by `(e + 1)` to `a`.

3. **Reversing and Query Processing:**
   - The array `a` is reversed.
   - For each query, the program processes the query using the `func_1` function.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes an integer `x` and checks if it exists in the dictionary `b`.
   - If `x` is in `b`, it returns the corresponding value.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the array `a` and updates `x` using the formula `x = (x - 1) % i + 1` until `x` matches an index in `b` or all elements in `a` are processed.

### Analysis of Function `func_1`:
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is directly in `b` by returning the corresponding value.
- The loop iterates through the array `a` and uses the modulo operation to find the correct position in the final array. This ensures that the function can handle large indices efficiently.
- The function correctly handles the periodic nature of the array construction by using the modulo operation.

### Correctness:
Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function `func_1`, the program appears to correctly handle the operations and queries as described. The function `func_1` accurately determines the k-th element in the final array by leveraging the periodic nature of the array construction.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: **True**
