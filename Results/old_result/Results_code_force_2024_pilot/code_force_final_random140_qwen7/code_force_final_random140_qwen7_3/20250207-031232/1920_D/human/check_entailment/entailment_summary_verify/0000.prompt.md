You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = [0]
    b = {}
    (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    for i in range(c):
        (d, e) = map(int, input().split())
        if a[-1] > 10 ** 19:
            continue
        if d & 1:
            a[-1] += 1
            b[a[-1]] = e
        else:
            a.append(a[-1] * (e + 1))
    a = a[::-1]
    print(str(list(map(r, input().split())))[1:-1].replace(',', ''))

def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if x in b:
        return b[x]
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        if x in b:
            return b[x]



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a single parameter `x`, which is an integer. It then checks if `x` is present in list `b`. If `x` is found in `b`, it returns the element at index `x` from `b`. If `x` is not found in `b`, it iterates through the list `a`, updating `x` using the formula `x = (x - 1) % i + 1` for each element `i` in `a`. If during this process, `x` becomes an index present in `b`, it returns the corresponding element from `b`. If no such index is found, it returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the operations and queries as described. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why it fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**:
   - The program uses `a = [0]` as the initial state of the array, but it should be an empty list since the array starts empty.
   - The logic to append elements and handle the doubling operation is flawed. The program does not properly update the array based on the operations provided.

2. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is supposed to find the k-th element in the final array, but it does not correctly simulate the array formation process.
   - The program does not maintain the correct structure of the array after performing the operations. Instead, it tries to reverse the array and use a dictionary to map indices, which is not necessary and leads to incorrect results.

3. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the first test case:
     - After the first operation, the array should be `[1]`.
     - After the second operation, the array should be `[1, 2]`.
     - After the third operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2]`.
     - After the fourth operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - After the fifth operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

   - The program does not correctly simulate these steps. For example, after the fifth operation, the array should contain 20 elements, but the program does not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
