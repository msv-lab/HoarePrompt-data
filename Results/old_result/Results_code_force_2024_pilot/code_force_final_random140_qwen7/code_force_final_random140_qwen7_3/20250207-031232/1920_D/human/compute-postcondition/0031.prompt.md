You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The first integer indicates the type of operation (1 or 2), and the second integer indicates the value or the number of copies for the operation. Additionally, the size of the array after performing all operations is at most \(10^{18}\), and the queries \(k_i\) are integers such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c)\), where \(c\) is the size of the array after all operations.
```
def func_1(x):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns the value at index x of a list or array named b, assuming b exists and is accessible in the current scope.

Case_2: The program returns the value of b at the index specified by a[2 * i + 1], where a[2 * i + 1] is an index that remains unchanged from its initial state and b is an existing list.

Case_3: Output State: The final value of `x` after the loop has executed all its iterations, which is determined by repeatedly applying the conditions within the loop until no further changes can be made to `x`. If `x` becomes 0 at any point due to the modulo operation, the function returns the value of `b[a[2 * i + 1]]` at the point where `x` was last updated to 0. Otherwise, the function returns `b[x]` once the loop completes all its iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `x` will hold its final value based on the operations performed inside the loop, and the function will return either `b[x]` or `b[a[2 * i + 1]]` if `x` was reduced to 0 during the process.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
