Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `i - 1`
- `f` is the same as before
- Whether the element at index `2 * i` in array `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.

### Loop Head Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(f - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means:
- The loop starts from `f - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches `-1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Current State
- `i` is `i - 1` (from the postcondition)
- `f` remains unchanged
- The condition for continuing the loop is that the element at index `2 * i` in array `a` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

### Next Iteration Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `i` is currently `i - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `(i - 1) - 1 = i - 2`.

### Updated State
- `i` should be `i - 2`
- `f` remains the same
- The condition for continuing the loop is that the element at index `2 * (i - 2)` in array `a` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `f` is the same as before, and whether the element at index `2 * (i - 2)` in array `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `f` is the same as before, and whether the element at index `2 * (i - 2)` in array `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.**
