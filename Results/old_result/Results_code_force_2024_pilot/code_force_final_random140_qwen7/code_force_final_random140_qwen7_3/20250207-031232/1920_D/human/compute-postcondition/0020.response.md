Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is a list of integers representing the results of Jayden's operations on the array a. The function returns an element from list 'b' at index 'x', where 'x' is calculated as (x - 1) % i + 1, and 'x' is not in the list 'b'. If 'x' is in the list 'b', it returns the element at index 'x'. If 'x' is not in the list 'b', it calculates 'x' as (x - 1) % i + 1 and returns the corresponding element from list 'b'.**
