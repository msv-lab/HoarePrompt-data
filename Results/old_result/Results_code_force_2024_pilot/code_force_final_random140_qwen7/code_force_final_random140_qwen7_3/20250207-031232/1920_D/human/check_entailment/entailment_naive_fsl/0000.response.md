Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the operations and queries as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**:
   - The program uses `a = [0]` as the initial state of the array, but it should be an empty list since the array starts empty.
   - The logic to append elements and handle the doubling operation is flawed. The program does not properly update the array based on the operations provided.

2. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is supposed to find the k-th element in the final array, but it does not correctly simulate the array formation process.
   - The program does not maintain the correct structure of the array after performing the operations. Instead, it tries to reverse the array and use a dictionary to map indices, which is not necessary and leads to incorrect results.

3. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the first test case:
     - After the first operation, the array should be `[1]`.
     - After the second operation, the array should be `[1, 2]`.
     - After the third operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2]`.
     - After the fourth operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - After the fifth operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

   - The program does not correctly simulate these steps. For example, after the fifth operation, the array should contain 20 elements, but the program does not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
