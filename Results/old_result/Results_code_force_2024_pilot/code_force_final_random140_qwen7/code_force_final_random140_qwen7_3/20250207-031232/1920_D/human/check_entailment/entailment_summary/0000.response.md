Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to implement the logic for processing the operations and answering the queries based on the problem description.
2. However, there are several issues with the implementation:
   - The program uses `a = [0]` as the initial state of the array, but it should be an empty list `[]`.
   - The logic for handling the operations is flawed. Specifically, when `d == 2`, the program incorrectly appends `a[-1] * (e + 1)` to the list `a`, which does not match the problem statement. According to the problem, if `d == 2`, `x` copies of the current array `a` should be appended.
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to handle the queries. It does not properly simulate the structure of the array after all operations have been performed.
   - The reverse operation of the array (`a = a[::-1]`) is unnecessary and incorrect since the array should not be reversed.
   - The final print statement uses an undefined function `r` and does not correctly format the output.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
