Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the size of the final array after all operations, and `x` is equal to ((`x` - 1) % `i` + 1), `i` is the first element in the list `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list.**

This means that the value of `x` has been updated to (`x` - 1) % `i` + 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions about `x` not being in the list `b`, `i` being the first element in the list `a`, and `a` being a non-empty list still hold true.
