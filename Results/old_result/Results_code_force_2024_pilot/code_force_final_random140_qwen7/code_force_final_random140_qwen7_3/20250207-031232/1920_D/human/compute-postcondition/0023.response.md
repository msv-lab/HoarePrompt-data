Postcondition: `i` is `i - 1`, `f` is the same as before, and if `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, we continue with the next iteration of the loop. If `a[2 * i]` is less than `x`, the condition does not change the values of `i` and `f`, and we also continue with the next iteration of the loop.
