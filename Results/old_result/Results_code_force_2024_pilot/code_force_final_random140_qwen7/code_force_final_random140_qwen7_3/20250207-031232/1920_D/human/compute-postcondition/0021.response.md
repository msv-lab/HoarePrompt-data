Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `x`, which is an integer. It then checks if `x` is present in list `b`. If `x` is found in `b`, it returns the element at index `x` from `b`. If `x` is not found in `b`, it iterates through the list `a`, updating `x` using the formula `x = (x - 1) % i + 1` for each element `i` in `a`. If during this process, `x` becomes an index present in `b`, it returns the corresponding element from `b`. If no such index is found, it returns `None`.**
