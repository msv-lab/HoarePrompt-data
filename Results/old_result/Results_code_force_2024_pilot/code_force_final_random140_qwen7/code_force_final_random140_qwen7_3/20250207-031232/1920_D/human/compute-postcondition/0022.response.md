Output State: **`i` is `i - 1`, `f` is the same as before and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. The value of `i` remains `i - 1` and the value of `f` remains unchanged.
