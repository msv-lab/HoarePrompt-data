Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is an array of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input, `s` is the string input from the user, `l` is incremented by 1 (so `l` is now `l + 1`), `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is the next character in the string `s`, and `k` is either 'L' or not 'L'. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is set to either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.**

This means that the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
