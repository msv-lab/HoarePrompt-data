Output State: **`l` is 0, `s` is an input string, `p` is not updated yet, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The code `r = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
