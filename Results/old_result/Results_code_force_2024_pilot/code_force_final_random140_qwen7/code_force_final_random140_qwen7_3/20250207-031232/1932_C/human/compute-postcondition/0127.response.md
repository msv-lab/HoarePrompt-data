Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `s`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1.
   - If `k` is not equal to 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, the variable `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `k` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - If `k` is 'L', then `l` will be 1.
   - If `k` is not 'L', then `r` will be decreased by 1.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string and remains unchanged, and considering the possible values of `k`, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

Since `s` is a non-empty string, it will remain the same. We need to consider the possible values of `k` and their effects on `l` and `r`.

- If `k` is 'L', then `l` will be 1.
- If `k` is not 'L', then `r` will be decreased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in the string `s`, if `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1, if `k` is not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1**.
