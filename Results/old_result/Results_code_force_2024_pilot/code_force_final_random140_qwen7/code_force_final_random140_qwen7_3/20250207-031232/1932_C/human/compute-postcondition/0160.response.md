Output State: **`ans` is equal to `p`, `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `l` is decremented by 1, `r` is increased by 2**.

Explanation: The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was previously incremented by 1 (as per the initial state), the new value of `r` is increased by 2 compared to its initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
