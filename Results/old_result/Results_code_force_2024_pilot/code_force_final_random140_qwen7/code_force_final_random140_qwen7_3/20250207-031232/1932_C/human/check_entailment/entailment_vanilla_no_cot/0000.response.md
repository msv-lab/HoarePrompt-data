Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it processes the commands and updates the indices `l` and `r`. The solution incorrectly updates the indices `l` and `r` before calculating the product, which leads to incorrect results. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        ans = []
        
        product = 1
        for a in arr:
            product = (product * a) % m
        
        for k in s:
            if k == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(arr.pop(0), -1, m)) % m
            else:
                product = (product * pow(arr.pop(), -1, m)) % m
            ans.append(product)
        
        print(*ans)

```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initial Product Calculation**: Calculate the initial product of the array modulo `m`.
2. **Processing Commands**:
   - For each command, update the product by multiplying with the appropriate element and then taking the modulo `m`.
   - If the command is 'L', pop the leftmost element and multiply the product by its modular inverse.
   - If the command is 'R', pop the rightmost element and multiply the product by its modular inverse.
3. **Store Results**: Store the product after each command in the result list.
4. **Output**: Print the results in the required format.

This approach ensures that the product is correctly updated and the indices are handled properly during the processing of each command.
