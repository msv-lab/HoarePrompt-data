Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is 'L', `l` is 1**.

Explanation: Initially, `s` is a non-empty string and `k` is equal to 'L'. The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since no initial value for `l` is given, we assume `l` starts as 0 (the default integer value). After executing `l += 1`, `l` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
