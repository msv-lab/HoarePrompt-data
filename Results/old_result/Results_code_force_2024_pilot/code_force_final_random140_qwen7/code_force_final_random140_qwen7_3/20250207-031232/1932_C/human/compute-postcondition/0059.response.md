Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers**.

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the third input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `input_value` remain unchanged from their initial states.
