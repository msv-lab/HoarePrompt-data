Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is not equal to 'L', `r` is decreased by 1.**

The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. Since `s` is a non-empty string and `k` is not equal to 'L', these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `r` has been decreased by 1 while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
