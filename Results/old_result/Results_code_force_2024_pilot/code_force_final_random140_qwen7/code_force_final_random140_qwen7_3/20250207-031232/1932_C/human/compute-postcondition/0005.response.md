Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is an array of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input, `s` is the string input from the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The code assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
