Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - `k` is the current character being processed from the string `s`.
   - The postcondition at the end of the previous iteration tells us that `s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in the string `s`, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1 more than its previous value.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop processes each character of the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r` is decreased by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `r` will be 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - If `k` was 'L' in the previous iteration, `l` will be 1 more than its previous value. However, since we are starting a new iteration, we cannot assume the value of `l` without knowing the exact value from the previous iteration. But we know that if `k` is 'L' in the current iteration, `l` will be 1 more than its previous value.

Given these points, we can construct the state for the start of the next iteration:

- `s` remains the same (non-empty string).
- `k` becomes the next character in the string `s`.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- If `k` is 'L', `l` will be 1 more than its previous value.

Since we don't have the exact value of `l` from the previous iteration, we can only express the state in terms of the changes:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, and if `k` is 'L', `l` is 1 more than its previous value**.
