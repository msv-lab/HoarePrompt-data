Output State: **`n` is the first integer input - 1, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `k` is the first character of the new `s`, `l` is 1, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `k` does not equal 'L'.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `k` is 'L', then `l` remains 1. If `k` is not 'L', then `r` is already decremented by 1 before this line of code is executed, so `r` is further decremented by 1. However, since the exact value of `r` before this operation is not specified, we only know that `l` is now 1.
