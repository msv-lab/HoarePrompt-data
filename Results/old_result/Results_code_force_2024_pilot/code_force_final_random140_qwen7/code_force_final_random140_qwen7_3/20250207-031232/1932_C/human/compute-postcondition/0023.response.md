Output State: The loop will continue to execute until there are no more characters in the string `s`. At that point, `l` will be equal to the number of times 'L' appeared in `s`, and `r` will be equal to `n - 1 - (number of times 'R' appeared in `s`). The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, `s`, and `k` will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, with `k` being the last character of `s`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is the integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is an array of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input, `s` is the string input from the user, and `k` is the last character of `s`. `l` is the count of 'L' characters in `s`, and `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s`.
