Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. The array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The string s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in s:
        if k == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    p = 1
    ans = []
    for strr in s[::-1]:
        if strr == 'R':
            r += 1
            p = p * arr[r] % m
        else:
            l -= 1
            p = p * arr[l] % m
        ans.append(p)
    print(*ans[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `p` is the product of `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo `m` for each character in the reversed string `s`, depending on whether the character is 'L' or 'R'; `l` is the final count of 'L' characters in the string `s` after processing each character; `r` is the final count of 'R' characters in the string `s` after processing each character; `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values; `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `p` for each iteration of the loop; `strr` is the last character of `s` after the loop has completed all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `p` will be the cumulative product of `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo `m` for each character in the reversed string `s`, with `l` and `r` being the final counts of 'L' and 'R' characters respectively in the string `s`. The list `ans` will contain the intermediate values of `p` for each iteration, and `strr` will be the last character of `s` after the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated according to the conditions specified within the loop for each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `p` for each iteration of the loop.

In this final state, `s` remains as it was initially because no operation modifies it inside the loop. The variable `p` is continuously updated based on whether the character read from `s[::-1]` is 'R' or not, multiplying `p` by the corresponding element from the list `arr` adjusted by either `r` or `l`, and taking modulo `m`. The list `ans` accumulates these updates, resulting in a list where each element corresponds to the value of `p` after each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` contains the final value of `p` after all iterations, `s` is an empty string, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1 - len(s)`, and `p` is the product of elements from the array `arr` based on the conditions inside the loop, taken modulo `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
