Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, m is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, a is an array of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.**

The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the standard input using the `input()` function and splits them based on spaces, converting them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. This updates the values of `n` and `m`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
