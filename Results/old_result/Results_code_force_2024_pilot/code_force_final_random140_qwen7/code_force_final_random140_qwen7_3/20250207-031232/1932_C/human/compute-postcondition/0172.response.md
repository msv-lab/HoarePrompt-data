Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer t, and for each t, it accepts two positive integers n and m, an array a of n integers, and a string s of length n consisting only of 'L' and 'R'. The function does not return anything explicitly based on the given information.**

However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact return type or behavior beyond accepting these parameters, the functionality can be described as accepting these specific parameters and processing them according to some internal logic (which is not detailed here).
