Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `p` is updated according to the condition specified, `ans` contains the updated value of `p`. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
