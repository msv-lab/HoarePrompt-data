Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` is not updated yet, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, the number of iterations is 0.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The other variables (`s`, `p`, `ans`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged. The number of iterations is also unchanged and remains 0.
