Based on the initial state described, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Reversed String `s`**: The string `s` is processed from right to left.
2. **Variables `l` and `r`**: These keep track of the counts of 'L' and 'R' characters in the string `s` after processing each character.
3. **List `ans`**: This list contains the intermediate values of `p` for each iteration of the loop.
4. **Variable `p`**: After the loop completes, `p` is the cumulative product of `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo `m` for each character in the reversed string `s`.

Given that the code snippet is:
```python
print(*ans[::-1])
```

This line of code will print the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order. 

Since `ans` contains the intermediate values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, and `p` is computed based on the counts of 'L' and 'R' characters in the reversed string `s`, the values in `ans` represent these intermediate products.

Therefore, the output will be the reversed list of intermediate values stored in `ans`.

Output: **[intermediate value of p for each iteration in reverse order]**
