Postcondition: `p` is an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `s` retain their initial values, `ans` is an empty list, `strr` is the last character of `s`. If the last character of `s` (`strr`) is 'R', then `p` is 1 times `arr[r]` modulo `m` and `r` is `n - 1` minus the count of 'R' characters in `s` plus 1. Otherwise, `p` is 1 times `arr[l]` modulo `m` and `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus 1.
