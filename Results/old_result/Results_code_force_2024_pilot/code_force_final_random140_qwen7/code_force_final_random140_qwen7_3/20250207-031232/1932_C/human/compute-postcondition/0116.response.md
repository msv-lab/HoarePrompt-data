Output State: **`s` is an input string, `p` is not updated yet, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, the number of iterations is 0.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the input string to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
