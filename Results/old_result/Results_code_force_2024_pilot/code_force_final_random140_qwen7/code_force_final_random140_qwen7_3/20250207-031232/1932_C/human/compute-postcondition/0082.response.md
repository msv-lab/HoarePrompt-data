Output State: **`n` is the first integer input - 1, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is an empty string, `k` is undefined, `l` is 0, `r` is -1**.

Explanation: The variable `p` is assigned the value 1. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The value of `l` remains 0 because no characters have been added to the string `s` yet, and the decrement operation for `r` is not applicable since there are no characters in `s` that are not 'L'.
