Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, the only object in the loop head is `k`, which represents the current character being processed.

2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: Since the loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`, the variable `k` will take on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means that `s` must be a non-empty string because if `s` is empty, there are no characters to iterate over, and the loop will not execute.

4. **List the adjusted states**: Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `s` to ensure it is a non-empty string.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string**.
