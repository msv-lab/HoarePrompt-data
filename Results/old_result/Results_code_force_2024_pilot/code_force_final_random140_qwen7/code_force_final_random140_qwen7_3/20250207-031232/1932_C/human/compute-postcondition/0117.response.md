Output State: **`l` is 0, `s` is an input string, `p` is not updated yet, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, the number of iterations is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `l` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their states. Therefore, the other variables remain in their initial states.
