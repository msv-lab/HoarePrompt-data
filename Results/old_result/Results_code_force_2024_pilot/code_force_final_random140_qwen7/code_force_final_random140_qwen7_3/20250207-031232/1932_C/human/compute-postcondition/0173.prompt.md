You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. The array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The string s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in s:
            if k == 'L':
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        
        p = 1
        
        ans = []
        
        for strr in s[::-1]:
            if strr == 'R':
                r += 1
                p = p * arr[r] % m
            else:
                l -= 1
                p = p * arr[l] % m
            ans.append(p)
        
        print(*ans[::-1])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `p` will be the final cumulative product of elements from the array `arr` based on the directions given by the string `s`, taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` will contain all the intermediate values of `p` calculated during each iteration of the loop. The variable `s` will be an empty string, `l` will be the total count of 'L' characters in the original string `s`, and `r` will be the total count of 'R' characters in the original string `s`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` will retain their initial values.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after processing all characters in the string `s` (both forward and backward), `p` will hold the final result of the product operations described in the loop, and `ans` will contain the sequence of intermediate results. The counts `l` and `r` will reflect the total occurrences of 'L' and 'R' in the original string `s`, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer t, and for each t, it accepts two positive integers n and m, an array a of n integers, and a string s of length n consisting only of 'L' and 'R'. The function does not return anything explicitly based on the given information.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
