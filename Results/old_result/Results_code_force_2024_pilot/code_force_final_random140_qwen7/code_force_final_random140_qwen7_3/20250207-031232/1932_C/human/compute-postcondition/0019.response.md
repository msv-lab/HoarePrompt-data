Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over each character `k` in the string `s`. Therefore, the relevant variables in the loop head are `k`, `s`, `l`, and `r`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - If `k` is 'L', then `l` is incremented by 1.
   - If `k` is not 'L', then `r` is set to either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input.
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.
   - `a` is an array of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input.
   - `s` is the string input from the user.
   - `l` is either 1 or 0.
   - `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
   - `k` is the next character in the string `s`, and it is either 'L' or not 'L'.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `k` is the next character in the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be the next character in `s`.
   - If `k` is 'L', then `l` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `k` is not 'L', then `r` will be set to either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `k`, `l`, and `r`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is an array of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input, `s` is the string input from the user, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is the next character in the string `s`, and `k` is either 'L' or not 'L'. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is set to either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.**

In summary, the specific states to be adjusted are:

- `k` will be the next character in `s`.
- If `k` is 'L', `l` will be incremented by 1.
- If `k` is not 'L', `r` will be set to either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.

So, the final state is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is an array of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the first two space-separated integers input, `s` is the string input from the user, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is the next character in the string `s`, and `k` is either 'L' or not 'L'. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is set to either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.**
