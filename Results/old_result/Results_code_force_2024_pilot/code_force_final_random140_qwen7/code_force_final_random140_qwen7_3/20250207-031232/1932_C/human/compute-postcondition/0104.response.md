Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the next character from the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `r` is 2, `p` is `p * arr[1] % m`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with `arr[r]` and taking the modulus with `m`. Initially, `r` was 1 more than its original value, so now `r` is 2. The other variables (`s`, `strr`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
