Output State: **`n` is the first integer input - 1, `m` is the second integer input, `input_value` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input split and converted to integers, `s` is a string input, `l` is 0**

Explanation: The code `r = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. However, since the variable `r` was not mentioned in the initial state, its assignment does not affect the existing variables. The values of `n`, `m`, `input_value`, `arr`, `s`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
