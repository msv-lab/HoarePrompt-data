Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is not equal to 'R', `l` is one less than its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is a non-empty string and `strr` is not equal to 'R', these conditions remain unchanged. The only updated variable is `l`, which is now one less than its original value.
