Output State: **`r` is now either `n - 3` or `n - 4`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` was previously either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. The code `r -= 1` decrements `r` by 1. Therefore, if `r` was `n - 2`, it becomes `n - 3`, and if `r` was `n - 3`, it becomes `n - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
