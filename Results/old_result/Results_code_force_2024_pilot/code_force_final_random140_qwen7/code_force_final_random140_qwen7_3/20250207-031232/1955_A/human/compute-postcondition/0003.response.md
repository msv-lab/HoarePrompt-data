Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the second input, `a` is the second integer from the second input, `b` is the third integer from the second input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**.

In this output state, the variable `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. All other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
