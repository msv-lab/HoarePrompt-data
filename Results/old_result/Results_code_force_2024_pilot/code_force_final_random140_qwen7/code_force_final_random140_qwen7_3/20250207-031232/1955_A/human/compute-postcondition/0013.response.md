Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, `s1` is `n * a`, `s2` is `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**.

This means that `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `s1` is calculated as `n * a`, and `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.
