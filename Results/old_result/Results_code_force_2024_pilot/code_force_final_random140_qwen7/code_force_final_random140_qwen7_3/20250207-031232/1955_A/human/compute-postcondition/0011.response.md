Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. Therefore, `t` is still an input integer, while `n`, `a`, and `b` are now the integers entered by the user.
