The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( t \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). It calculates two expressions, \( s1 = n \times a \) and \( s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a \), for each test case and prints the minimum of these two values. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the minimum values of \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) for each test case, one per line, in the order they were processed.
