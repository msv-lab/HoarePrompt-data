Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `n` is the first integer from the second input.
   - `a` is the second integer from the second input.
   - `b` is the third integer from the second input.
   - `s1` is equal to `n * a`.
   - `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(min(s1, s2))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `s1 = n * a`: This is straightforward; it's simply the product of `n` and `a`.
   - `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`: Here, `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n % 2` gives the remainder of `n` divided by 2. So, `s2` is the sum of `b` times the integer division of `n` by 2 and `a` times the remainder of `n` divided by 2.

4. **Calculate `min(s1, s2)`:**
   - To determine which value is smaller between `s1` and `s2`, we need to consider the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - If `n` is even, then `n // 2` is `n / 2` and `n % 2` is 0, so `s2 = b * (n // 2)`.
   - If `n` is odd, then `n // 2` is `(n - 1) / 2` and `n % 2` is 1, so `s2 = b * ((n - 1) / 2) + a`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the minimum of `s1` and `s2`.

Given this breakdown, the output will be the minimum value between `n * a` and `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

Output: **min(n * a, b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a)**
