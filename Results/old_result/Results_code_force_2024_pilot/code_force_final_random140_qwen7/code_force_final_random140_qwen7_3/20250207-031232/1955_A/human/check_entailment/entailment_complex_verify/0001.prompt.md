You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        s1 = n * a
        s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a
        print(min(s1, s2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        s1 = n * a
        
        s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a
        
        print(min(s1, s2))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases specified by the initial integer `t` have been processed. After all iterations, the following will be true:
    #
    #- `t` will be the initial input integer specifying the number of test cases.
    #- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the most recent values entered by the user during that iteration.
    #- `s1` will be the value of `n * a` for the last processed test case.
    #- `s2` will be the value of `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a` for the last processed test case.
    #- The final output will be the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for the last processed test case, printed for each test case as the loop progresses.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the output will consist of the minimum values of `s1` and `s2` calculated for each of the `t` test cases, printed one per line in the order they were processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( t \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). It calculates two expressions, \( s1 = n \times a \) and \( s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a \), for each test case and prints the minimum of these two values. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the minimum values of \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) for each test case, one per line, in the order they were processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `s1` is calculated as `n * a`, which is the total cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. This formula accounts for the promotion price:
     - `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price.
     - `n % 2` gives the number of remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2`, which is the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - `s1 = 2 * 5 = 10`
   - `s2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 5 = 9 * 1 + 0 * 5 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
   - `s2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 9 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
   - `s2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 11 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 16`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - `s1 = 4 * 5 = 20`
   - `s2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * 5 = 11 * 2 + 0 * 5 = 22`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
