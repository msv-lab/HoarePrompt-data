Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers: t, n, a, and b. The integer t represents the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. The function does not return a specific value but rather processes these integers according to their constraints.**
