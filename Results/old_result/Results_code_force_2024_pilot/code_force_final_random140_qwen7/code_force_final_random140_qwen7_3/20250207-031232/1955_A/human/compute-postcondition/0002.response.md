Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the second input, `a` is the second integer from the second input, `b` is the third integer from the second input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`**.

This means that the variable `s1` has been assigned the value of `n * a`, while the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
