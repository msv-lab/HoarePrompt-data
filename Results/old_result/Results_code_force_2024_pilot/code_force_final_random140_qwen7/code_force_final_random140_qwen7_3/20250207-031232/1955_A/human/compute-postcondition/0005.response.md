Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` is an input integer.
- `n` is the first integer from the second input.
- `a` is the second integer from the second input.
- `b` is the third integer from the second input.
- `s1` is equal to `n * a`.
- `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

### Loop Statement
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable used in the `for` loop is `_`. This is a common practice when the loop variable is not needed inside the loop body.
2. **Number of Iterations**: The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`. This means the loop will run as many times as the user inputs an integer.

### States to Adjust
Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we don't need to adjust any specific variables related to the loop itself. However, we need to consider the state of the program after each iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Input for Next Iteration**: After each iteration, the user will provide another integer input, which determines the number of remaining iterations.
2. **State Update**: We need to update the state based on the new input.

### Updated State
At the start of the next iteration, the state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop.
- The new value of `n` will be the first integer from the new input.
- The new value of `a` will be the second integer from the new input.
- The new value of `b` will be the third integer from the new input.
- `s1` will be updated to `n * a`.
- `s2` will be updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**
