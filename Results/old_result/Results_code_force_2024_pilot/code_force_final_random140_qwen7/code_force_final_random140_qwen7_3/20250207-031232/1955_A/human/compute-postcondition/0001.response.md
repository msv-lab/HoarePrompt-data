Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the second input, `a` is the second integer from the second input, and `b` is the third integer from the second input**.

Explanation: The initial state sets `t` to the value of `int(input())`. The code then reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively using the `map(int, input().split())` function. The values of `t` remain unchanged, while `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the respective integers from the second input.
