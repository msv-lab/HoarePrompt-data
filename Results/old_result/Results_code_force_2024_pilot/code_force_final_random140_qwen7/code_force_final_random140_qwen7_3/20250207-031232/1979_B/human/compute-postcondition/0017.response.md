Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` is half of its original value, `y` must be greater than 0, `l2` contains an element which is `y % 2`**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` must be greater than 0 initially, after the operation, `y` will be half of its original value, and it will still be greater than 0 (assuming the original value was even). The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `l2`) remain unchanged.
