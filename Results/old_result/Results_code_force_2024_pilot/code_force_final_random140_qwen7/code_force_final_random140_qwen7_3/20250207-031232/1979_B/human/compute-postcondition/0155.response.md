Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended. The length of both `l1` and `l2` is now one more than before.**
