Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the binary representation of `x` (i.e., `x` converted to binary), the list `l2` matches the initial state plus `y % 2` appended to it, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero.**

Explanation: The code appends `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Given that `y` must be non-zero, `y % 2` will be either 1 or -1 depending on whether `y` is odd or even. However, since the exact value of `y` is not specified, we keep it in the form `y % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
