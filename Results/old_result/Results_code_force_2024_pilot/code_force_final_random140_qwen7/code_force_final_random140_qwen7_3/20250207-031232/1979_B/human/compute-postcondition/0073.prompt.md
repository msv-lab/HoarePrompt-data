Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` is now an empty list, the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, and `t` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while x:
    l1.append(x % 2)
    x //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the value `x // 2 % 2`, the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, and `t` is 1, `x` is non-zero, `y` is an input integer.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` now contains the value `x // 2 % 2` followed by `x % 2`, the list `l2` remains unchanged, `t` is 1, `x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an input integer
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` now contains the value `x // 2 % 2`, `x % 2 // 2`, and `x % 2`, `t` is 1, `x` is `x // 2`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
