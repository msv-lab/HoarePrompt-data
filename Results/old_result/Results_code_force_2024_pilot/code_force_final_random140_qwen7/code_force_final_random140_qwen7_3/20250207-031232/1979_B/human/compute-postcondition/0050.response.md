Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` was initially set to 1 based on the condition that `l1[0]` equals `l2[0]`. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, making its value 2. The values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
