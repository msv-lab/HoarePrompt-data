Output State: **`l2` contains the element `y % 2`, and all other variables retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `l2` or the value of `y`, we only know that `l2` now includes the element `y % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
