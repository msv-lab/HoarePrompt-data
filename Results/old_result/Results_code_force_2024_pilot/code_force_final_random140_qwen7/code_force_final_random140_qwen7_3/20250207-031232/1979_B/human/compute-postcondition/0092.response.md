Postcondition: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x`, the list `l2` contains the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. Additionally, if the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, then `l1` is appended with a `0`.
