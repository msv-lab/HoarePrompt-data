Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, the output state reflects that `t` now holds the value of the input integer within this range. All other variables (such as `x` and `y`) remain unaffected and retain their initial conditions of being distinct non-negative integers within the specified range.
