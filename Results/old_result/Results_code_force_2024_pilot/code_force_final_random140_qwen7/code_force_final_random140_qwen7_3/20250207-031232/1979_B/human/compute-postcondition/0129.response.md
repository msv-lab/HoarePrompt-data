Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `n-3`, `l1` is `[x % 2, x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and the result is an integer (floor division). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
