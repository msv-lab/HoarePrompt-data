Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `x`. This means the loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero.

2. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `x // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be non-zero (`x > 0`).

Given this information, we need to ensure that `x` is non-zero for the next iteration. Since `x` is updated to `x // 2` in each iteration, we need to ensure that `x` was not zero before the current iteration.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `total` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
   - `cnt` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
   - `l1` and `l2` remain the same as they are not involved in the loop condition.
   - `t` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
   - `x` must be non-zero for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` now contains the value `x // 2 % 2` followed by `x % 2`, the list `l2` remains unchanged, `t` is 1, `x` must be non-zero**
