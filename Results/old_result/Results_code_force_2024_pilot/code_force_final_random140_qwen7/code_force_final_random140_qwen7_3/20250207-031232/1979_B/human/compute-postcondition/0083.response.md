Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l2` now has an additional element which is `y % 2`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is now `y // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated to `y // 2`, which means `y` is divided by 2 and the result is an integer (floor division). The other variables remain unchanged.
