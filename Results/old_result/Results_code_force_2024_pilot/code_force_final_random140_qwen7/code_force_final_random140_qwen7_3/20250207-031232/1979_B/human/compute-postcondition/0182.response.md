Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it takes two distinct non-negative integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, and returns a value based on the relationship between x and y.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific return conditions in the problem statement, the function likely iterates over t test cases, processes each pair of x and y, and returns some result based on their comparison or relationship. However, without explicit return conditions, the focus is on the acceptance and processing of parameters within the function's scope.
