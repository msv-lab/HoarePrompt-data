Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the binary representation of `x` in reverse order, the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, and `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the least significant bit of `x` to `l1` until `x` becomes 0. Since `x` is an integer, this process will eventually terminate when all bits of `x` have been processed and `x` reaches 0. At this point, `l1` will contain the binary representation of `x` in reverse order (from least significant bit to most significant bit). The variable `total` remains 0 as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `cnt` remains unchanged unless there is additional logic in the loop to update it based on the comparison between `l1` and `l2`. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` also remain as described.
