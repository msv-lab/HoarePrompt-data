Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `cnt` is 1 if `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]` at the first index, otherwise `i` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Analyze the possible values of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - To continue the loop, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0), so `i` must become 1 if it was 0, or it must stay as 1 if it was already 1.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` can only increment by 1, if `i` was 0, it becomes 1.
   - If `i` was 1, it stays as 1.
   - The value of `n` does not change based on the given information.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `i` becomes 1 if it was 0, otherwise it remains 1.
   - `cnt` is not directly affected by the loop continuation, but its value depends on the comparison inside the loop. Since we don't have the exact condition for `cnt`, we keep it as it is.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1 if `l1[0]` equals `l2[0]`, otherwise `i` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
