Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input**.

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
