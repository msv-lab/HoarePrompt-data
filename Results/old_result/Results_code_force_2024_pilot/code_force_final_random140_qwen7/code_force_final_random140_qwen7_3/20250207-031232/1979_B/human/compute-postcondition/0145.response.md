Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `y` in reverse order.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `x` will be reduced to 0 through repeated integer division by 2, which means the loop will stop when `y` becomes 0. At this point, `y` will no longer be greater than 0, and the loop condition `y` will no longer be satisfied. The list `l2` will contain all the binary digits of the original `y` value in reverse order as it gets appended during each iteration of the loop.
