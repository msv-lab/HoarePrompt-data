Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` equals 0, `l2` contains the complete binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will have become 0 since the loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero and each iteration reduces `x` by performing `x //= 2`. Once `x` reaches 0, the loop terminates. During each iteration, the loop appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to `l2` and then updates `y` to `y // 2`. Since `y` starts as the original value of `x` and is halved with each iteration until it also reaches 0, `l2` will contain the full binary representation of the original `x` (in reverse order) once the loop completes.
