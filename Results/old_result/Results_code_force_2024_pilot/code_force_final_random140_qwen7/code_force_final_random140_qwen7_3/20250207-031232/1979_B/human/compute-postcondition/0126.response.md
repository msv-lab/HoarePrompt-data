Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is `x // 2`, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `n-2`, `l1` is `[x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` is updated to its value divided by 2, while `i` is decremented by 1 since `i` was initially set to `n-1`.
