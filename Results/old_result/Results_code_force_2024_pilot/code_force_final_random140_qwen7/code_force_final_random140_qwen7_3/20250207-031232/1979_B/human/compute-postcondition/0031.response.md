Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` equals 0, `l2` contains the complete binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), and the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`; `l1` now contains the element 0 appended to its previous elements.**

Explanation: The code `l1.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `l1`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, `x` is still 0, `y` is still 0, and `l2` retains its original binary representation of `x` in reverse order with its length condition intact.
