Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is either 3 or 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was either 2 or 1 initially, after adding 1, `cnt` will be either 3 (if it was 2) or 2 (if it was 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
