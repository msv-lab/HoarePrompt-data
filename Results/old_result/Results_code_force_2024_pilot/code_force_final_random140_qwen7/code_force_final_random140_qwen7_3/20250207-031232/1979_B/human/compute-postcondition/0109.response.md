Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is either 2 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was either 1 or 0 initially, it will now be either 2 (if it was 1) or 1 (if it was 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
