Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is `x // 2`, `y` is an integer from input; `l1` is a list containing `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list**

The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `x`. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, `y` remains an integer from input, `l1` remains a list containing `x % 2`, and `l2` remains an empty list.
