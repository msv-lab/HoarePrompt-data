Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` now contains the value `x // 2 % 2` followed by `x % 2`, the list `l2` remains unchanged, `t` is 1, `x` is non-zero, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `l1.append(x % 2)` appends the value of `x % 2` to the end of the list `l1`. The value of `x // 2 % 2` is already present in `l1` before the append operation. Therefore, the updated list `l1` now contains `x // 2 % 2` followed by `x % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
