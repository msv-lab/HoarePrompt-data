Based on the initial state provided:

- The variable `i` is equal to `n`.
- The variable `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`.
- The variable `total` is still 0.
- The list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(2 ** cnt)
```

Here, `2 ** cnt` means raising 2 to the power of `cnt`. Since `cnt` represents the number of matching positions between `l1` and `l2` from the start up to position `n-1`, it is a non-negative integer.

Given this, the output will be \(2\) raised to the power of `cnt`.

Output: **2 ** cnt** (where cnt is the number of matching positions between l1 and l2 from the start up to position n-1)**
