Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        l1, l2 = [], []
        
        while x:
            l1.append(x % 2)
            x //= 2
        
        while y:
            l2.append(y % 2)
            y //= 2
        
        if len(l2) < len(l1):
            l2.append(0)
        elif len(l1) < len(l2):
            l1.append(0)
        
        n = len(l1)
        
        if len(l2) < len(l1):
            n = len(l2)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if l1[i] == l2[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(2 ** cnt)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`. The variable `total` is still 0, and the lists `l1` and `l2` are populated with the binary representations of the last input integers `x` and `y` respectively, with any necessary leading zeros added to make their lengths equal.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it takes two distinct non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\). It converts these integers into their binary representations, ensures both have the same length by padding with leading zeros if necessary, and then counts the number of matching bits from the start of both binary strings. Finally, it prints \(2\) raised to the power of the count of matching bits.
