Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` equals 0, `y` equals 0, `l2` contains the complete binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), and the length of `l2` is at least the length of `l1`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` now contains the element 0 appended to its previous elements.**
