Output State: **`l2` contains the elements `y // 2 // 2` and `y % 2`, `y` is `y // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. This means `y` now holds the value of `y // 2`. Since `l2` originally contained the elements `y // 2` and `y % 2`, after executing the code, the first element of `l2` changes to `y // 2 // 2` (which is equivalent to `y // 4`) and the second element remains `y % 2`.
