Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 by default when using `range(n)`.
   - `n` is the number of iterations the loop will perform, which is determined by the length of `l2`.

3. **Check the given state before the loop**:
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `x` equals 0.
   - `y` equals 0.
   - `l2` contains the complete binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order) and its length is less than the length of `l1`.
   - `n` is the length of `l2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 by default, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is set correctly, which is the length of `l2`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the length of `l2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be the length of `l2`**.

Note: The initial values of `cnt`, `t`, `x`, `y`, and the relationship between `l1` and `l2` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.
