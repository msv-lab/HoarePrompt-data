Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `l2`, `cnt` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is implied to be 0 since no initial value is given). Given the initial state, `cnt` was initially 0, and after executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables (`total`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
