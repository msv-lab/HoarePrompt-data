You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        l1, l2 = [], []
        
        while x:
            l1.append(x % 2)
            x //= 2
        
        while y:
            l2.append(y % 2)
            y //= 2
        
        if len(l2) < len(l1):
            l2.append(0)
        elif len(l1) < len(l2):
            l1.append(0)
        
        n = len(l1)
        
        if len(l2) < len(l1):
            n = len(l2)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if l1[i] == l2[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(2 ** cnt)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`. The variable `total` is still 0, and the lists `l1` and `l2` are populated with the binary representations of the last input integers `x` and `y` respectively, with any necessary leading zeros added to make their lengths equal.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it takes two distinct non-negative integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, and returns a value based on the relationship between x and y.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
