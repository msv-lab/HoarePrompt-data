Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the same as before, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on the comparison in the loop body, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which would exit the loop or if statement it was inside. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
