Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    l1, l2 = [], []
    while x:
        l1.append(x % 2)
        x //= 2
    while y:
        l2.append(y % 2)
        y //= 2
    if len(l2) < len(l1):
        l2.append(0)
    elif len(l1) < len(l2):
        l1.append(0)
    n = len(l1)
    if len(l2) < len(l1):
        n = len(l2)
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if l1[i] == l2[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            break
    print(2 ** cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`. The variable `total` is still 0, and the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`. The loop has executed all its iterations, which means it either found `n` consecutive matching elements in `l1` and `l2` (thus `cnt` equals `n`) or it encountered a non-matching pair before completing all iterations (thus `cnt` is less than `n`).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt` will hold the count of consecutive matching elements between `l1` and `l2`, up to the length of the shorter list, and `i` will be set to the index just after the last checked element, which is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `total` is 0, `cnt` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will have reached the last index of `l1` (which is `n-1`). The variable `cnt` will hold the count of positions where the corresponding elements in `l1` and `l2` are equal, ranging from 0 to `n` depending on how many matches were found before the loop broke due to a mismatch. The other variables (`total`, `t`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
