The loop condition is `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be non-zero (greater than 0). At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `x // 2`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `x` must be non-zero after this operation.

Given that `x` is updated to `x // 2`, the only way to ensure `x` is non-zero is to ensure that `x` was odd at the start of the current iteration (since dividing an odd number by 2 results in a non-zero integer).

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- The variable `x` must be such that `x // 2` is non-zero. This means `x` itself must be greater than 0 and odd.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is `x // 2` and must be greater than 0, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list**
