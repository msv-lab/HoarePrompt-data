Postcondition: `total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended if the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, and the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`.
