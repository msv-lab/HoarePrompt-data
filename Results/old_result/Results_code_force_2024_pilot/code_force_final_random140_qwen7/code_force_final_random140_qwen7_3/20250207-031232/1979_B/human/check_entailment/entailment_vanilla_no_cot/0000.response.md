Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it attempts to compare the binary representations of `x` and `y` to find the longest common prefix, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to understand the properties of the XOR operation. Specifically, we should focus on finding the longest prefix of `n ⊕ x` that matches a prefix of `n ⊕ y`. This can be done more efficiently without converting the numbers to their binary representations.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        cnt = 0
        while x != 0 and y != 0:
            if x & 1 == y & 1:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                break
            x >>= 1
            y >>= 1
        print(2 ** cnt)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case.
2. **Binary Comparison**: For each test case, initialize a counter `cnt` to zero.
3. **Loop Until Both Numbers Are Non-Zero**: Use a loop to check the least significant bits of `x` and `y` until both numbers become zero.
4. **Check Bitwise Equality**: If the least significant bits of `x` and `y` are equal, increment the counter `cnt`.
5. **Right Shift**: Right shift both `x` and `y` to check the next bit in the next iteration.
6. **Output Result**: Once the loop breaks, the value of `cnt` represents the length of the longest common prefix in terms of the number of bits. Since the sequences are infinite, the result is `2 ** cnt`.

This approach directly compares the bits of `x` and `y` and finds the longest common prefix, which is the correct way to solve the problem.
