Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order, and the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. The current length of `l1` is now one more than before.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `l1`. Since `l1` was originally a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order, appending `0` to it increases its length by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
