Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the length of `l1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Postconditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `cnt` is either 1 or 0.
   - `n` is the length of `l1`.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended.
   - `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended.
   - The length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop condition is `i < n`, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - `n` remains the same because it is determined by the length of `l1` and does not change within the loop.

6. **Update the states**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `cnt` remains either 1 or 0.
   - `n` remains the length of `l1`.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `x` remains 0.
   - `y` remains 0.
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `l1` remains the same.
   - `l2` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 0, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.**
