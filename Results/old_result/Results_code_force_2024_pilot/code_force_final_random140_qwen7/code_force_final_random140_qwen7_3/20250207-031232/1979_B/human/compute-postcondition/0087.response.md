Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x`, the list `l2` now contains the binary representation of the original value of `y` with an additional `0` appended at the end, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and the length of `l2` is now one more than the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `0` to the list `l2`. Since `l2` was initially shorter than `l1`, appending `0` increases its length by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
