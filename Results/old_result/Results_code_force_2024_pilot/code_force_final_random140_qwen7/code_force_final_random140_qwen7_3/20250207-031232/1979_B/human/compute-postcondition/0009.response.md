Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is `x // 2`, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `x`. The value of `t` remains unchanged since it was only mentioned to be greater than 0. The value of `y` remains unchanged as it was defined as an integer from input. The list `l1` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned to contain `x % 2`. The list `l2` remains an empty list as no changes were made to it.
