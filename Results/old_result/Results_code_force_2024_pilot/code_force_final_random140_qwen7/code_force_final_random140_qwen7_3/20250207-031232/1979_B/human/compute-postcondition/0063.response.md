Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` is now an empty list, the list `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, and `t` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `l1` and `l2`. This operation does not affect the values of `total`, `cnt`, `t`, `x`, or `y`. It only changes the state of `l1` and `l2` to be empty lists. The precondition that `l2` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length is preserved.
