Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `n-3`, `l1` is `[x % 2, x % 2, x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `l1.append(x % 2)` appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x % 2` is either 0 or 1 (because `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2), `l1` now contains three elements, each being `x % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
