Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is a non-zero input integer, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `l1` is `[x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code appends `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` is a non-zero input integer, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
