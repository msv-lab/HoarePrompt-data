Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l1` now contains the value `x // 2 % 2`, `x % 2`, and `x % 2`, the list `l2` remains unchanged, `t` is 1, `x` must be non-zero**

Explanation: The code appends `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Initially, `l1` contained the value `x // 2 % 2` followed by `x % 2`. After appending `x % 2`, `l1` now contains `x // 2 % 2`, `x % 2`, and `x % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
