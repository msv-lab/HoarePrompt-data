Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `l1` and `l2` match from the start up to position `n-1`, the list `l2` now has an additional element which is `y % 2`, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is halved.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` was a non-zero integer, after the operation, `y` is now half of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
