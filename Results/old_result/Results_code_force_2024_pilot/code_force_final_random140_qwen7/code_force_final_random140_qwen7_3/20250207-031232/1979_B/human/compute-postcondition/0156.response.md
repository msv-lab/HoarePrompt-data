Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `l1`, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is -1, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the integer `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and `l2` is a list containing all the binary digits of `x` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(l1)` assigns the length of the list `l1` to the variable `n`. The length of `l1` is one more than the number of binary digits of `x` because it includes an additional 0 appended to the reversed binary representation of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
