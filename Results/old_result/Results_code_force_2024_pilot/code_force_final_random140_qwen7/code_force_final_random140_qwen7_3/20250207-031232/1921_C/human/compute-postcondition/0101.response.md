Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`
   - `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`
   - `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`
   - `possible` is `False`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1`, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `f` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are specified.
   - `time_diff` will now be `arr[2] - arr[1]`.
   - `energy_keep_on` will be `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`.
   - `energy_cost` will be `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`.
   - `energy_turn_off_on` remains `b`.
   - `possible` remains `False` because the loop body does not change its value.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`
   - `i` is `2`
   - `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`
   - `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`
   - `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`
   - `possible` is `False`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`, `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`**
