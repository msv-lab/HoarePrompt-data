Output State: **`f` is `f - energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`**

Explanation: The code updates `energy_cost` to be the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` (which is `a * time_diff`) and `energy_turn_off_on` (which is `b`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
