Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive), so the loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `f` is `f - energy_cost`
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`
   - `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`
   - `energy_cost` is `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is now `n + 1`, the loop will stop executing because `i` is no longer less than `n + 1`.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `f` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the loop itself.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`f` is `f - energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`**
