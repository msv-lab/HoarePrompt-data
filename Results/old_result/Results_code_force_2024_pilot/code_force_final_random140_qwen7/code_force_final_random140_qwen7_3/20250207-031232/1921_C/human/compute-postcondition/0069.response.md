Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, `possible` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional was specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
