Output State: **`possible` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`, the value of `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`**.

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `possible`, but does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, or `f`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
