Output State: **`t` is an input integer and greater than 0, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `m` is not yet defined, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` that starts with 0 followed by the integers split from the input. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.
