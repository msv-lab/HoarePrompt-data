Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, `possible` is `False`**.

Explanation: The variable `possible` is set to `False`, which means no changes were made to the other variables. All other variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
