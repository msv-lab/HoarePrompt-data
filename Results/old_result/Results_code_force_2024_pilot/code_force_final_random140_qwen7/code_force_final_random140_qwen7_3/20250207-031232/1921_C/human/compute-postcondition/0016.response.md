Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`
   - `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`
   - `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`
   - `f` is reduced by `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `f` are not part of the loop head and their values remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `f` is reduced by `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`**
