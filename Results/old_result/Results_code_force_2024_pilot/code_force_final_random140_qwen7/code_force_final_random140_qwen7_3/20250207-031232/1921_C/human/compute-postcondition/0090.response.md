Output State: **`f` is `f - energy_cost`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`**.

Explanation: The code `f -= energy_cost` subtracts the value of `energy_cost` from `f`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `energy_cost` is defined as `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`, and since no changes are made to `i`, `n`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost`, their states remain the same as the initial state, except for `f`, which is now `f - energy_cost`.
