Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their values:

1. `i` is `n`.
2. `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`.
3. `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`.
4. `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.
5. `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`.
6. `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`.
7. `possible` is `False`.

Given these values, the `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
```

Since `possible` is explicitly set to `False` after the loop completes, the condition `if possible` will evaluate to `False`. Therefore, the string `'NO'` will be printed.

Output: **NO**
