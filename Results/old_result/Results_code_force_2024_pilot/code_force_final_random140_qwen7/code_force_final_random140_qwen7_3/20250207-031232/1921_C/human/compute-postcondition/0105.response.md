Output State: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`, `i` is `2`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`, `energy_cost` is now `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `energy_cost` to be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Since `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, and `energy_cost` was previously defined as `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, the new value of `energy_cost` is simply the minimum of these two expressions. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
