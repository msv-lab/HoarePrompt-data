Output State: **`i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`, and the value of `f` is decreased by `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`**.

This means that the variable `f` has been updated by subtracting `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)` from its original value, while all other variables remain unchanged.
