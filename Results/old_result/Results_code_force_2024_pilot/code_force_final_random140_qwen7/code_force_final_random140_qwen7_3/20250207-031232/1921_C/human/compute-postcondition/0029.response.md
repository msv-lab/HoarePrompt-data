Output State: **`f` is reduced by `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`**.

Explanation: The line `energy_turn_off_on = b` assigns the value of `b` to the variable `energy_turn_off_on`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `f`, `possible`, `i`, `time_diff`, and `energy_keep_on` remain unchanged from their initial states.
