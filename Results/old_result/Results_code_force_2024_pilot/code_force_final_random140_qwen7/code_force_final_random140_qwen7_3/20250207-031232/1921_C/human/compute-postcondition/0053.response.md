Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`
- `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`
- `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`
- `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`
- `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`
- `possible` is `False`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` should be set to 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- **Other Variables**: The other variables (`time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `f`, and `possible`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2
- `time_diff` remains `arr[1] - arr[0]`
- `energy_keep_on` remains `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`
- `energy_turn_off_on` remains `b`
- `energy_cost` remains `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`
- `f` remains `f - min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`
- `possible` remains `False`

### Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, `possible` is `False`**
