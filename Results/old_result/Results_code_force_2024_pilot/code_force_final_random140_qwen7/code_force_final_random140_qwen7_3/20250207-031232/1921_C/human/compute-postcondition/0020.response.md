Output State: **`i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`, and `f` is reduced by `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates `energy_cost` to be the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Given that `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is now set to `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
