Output State: **`f` is `f - 2 * energy_cost`, `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`, and `possible` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `f -= energy_cost` subtracts `energy_cost` from `f`. Since `energy_cost` was defined as `min(a * time_diff, b)`, the new value of `f` becomes `f - energy_cost`. The other variables (`i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `possible`) remain unchanged.
