Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`, if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
