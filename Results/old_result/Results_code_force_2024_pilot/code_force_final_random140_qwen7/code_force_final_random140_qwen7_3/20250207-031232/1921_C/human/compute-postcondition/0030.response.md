Output State: **`f` is reduced by `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`**.

Explanation: The code updates `energy_cost` to be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Since `energy_keep_on` is defined as `a * time_diff` and `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is now `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`. The other variables (`f`, `possible`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, and `energy_turn_off_on`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
