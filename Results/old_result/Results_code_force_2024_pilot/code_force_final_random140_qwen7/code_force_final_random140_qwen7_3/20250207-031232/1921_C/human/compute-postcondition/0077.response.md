The code `n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. This changes the values of these variables, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
2. `f` is assigned the second integer from the input.
3. `a` is assigned the third integer from the input.
4. `b` is assigned the fourth integer from the input.

The initial values of `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `f`, `possible`, and `t` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`, `t` is `0`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the third integer from the input, `b` is the fourth integer from the input.**
