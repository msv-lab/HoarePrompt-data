Output State: **`i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`.**

The variable `possible` is set to `False`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
