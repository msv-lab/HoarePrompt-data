Output State: **`i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, `possible` is `False`**.

The variable `possible` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` remain unchanged from their initial states.
