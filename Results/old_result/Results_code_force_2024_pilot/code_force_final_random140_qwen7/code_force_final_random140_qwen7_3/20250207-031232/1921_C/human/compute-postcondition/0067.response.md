Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`**.

This means that the variable `energy_cost` is assigned the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Since `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` will be the smaller of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
