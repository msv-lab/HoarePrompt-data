Output State: **`i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`, `energy_cost` is recalculated as `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `energy_cost` to be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Since `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is now `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
