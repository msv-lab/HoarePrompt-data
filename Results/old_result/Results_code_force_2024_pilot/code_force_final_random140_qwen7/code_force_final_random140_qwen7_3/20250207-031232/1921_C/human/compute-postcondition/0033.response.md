Postcondition: `f` is reduced by `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `possible` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
