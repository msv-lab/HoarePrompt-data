Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate over the values from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 1 (the first value in the range), `i` must be initialized to 1 before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer, and it should be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `arr`, and `possible`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their initial states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
