Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.**

The code assigns the value of `b` to the variable `energy_turn_off_on`. Since `b` is a specific value, `energy_turn_off_on` is directly set to `b`. The other variables (`i`, `time_diff`, and `energy_keep_on`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
