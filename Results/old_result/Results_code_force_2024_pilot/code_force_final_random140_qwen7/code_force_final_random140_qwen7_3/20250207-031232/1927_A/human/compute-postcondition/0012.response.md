Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, `min_paint` is the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one.**

Explanation: The code `last_black = s.rfind('B')` updates the value of `last_black` to be the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
