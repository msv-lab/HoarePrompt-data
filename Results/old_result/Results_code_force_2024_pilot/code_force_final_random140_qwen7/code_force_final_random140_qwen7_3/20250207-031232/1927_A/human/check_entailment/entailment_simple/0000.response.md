Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white.
2. The annotated program correctly identifies the first and last positions of 'B' (black) in the string `s`.
3. The calculation `last_black - first_black + 1` gives the length of the segment needed to cover all black cells from the first to the last occurrence.
4. This approach ensures that the entire strip becomes white with the minimum segment painting, as it covers all black cells in the shortest possible span.
5. The program handles multiple test cases as required, iterating through each test case and performing the necessary calculations.

Given the logic and the steps taken in the program, it appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
