You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        first_black = s.find('B')
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        print(min_paint)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), followed by \( t \) pairs of integers \( n \) and strings \( s \). For each string \( s \), which consists of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B', it finds the indices of the first and last 'B' characters, calculates the minimum number of wall paints needed to cover all 'B' characters, and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s` representing the strip of cells. This is also handled correctly.

3. **Finding Black Cells**: 
   - `first_black = s.find('B')`: This finds the index of the first black cell ('B') in the string `s`.
   - `last_black = s.rfind('B')`: This finds the index of the last black cell ('B') in the string `s`.

4. **Calculating Minimum Paint Length**:
   - `min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1`: This calculates the length of the segment between the first and last black cells, inclusive. This logic is correct because it ensures that all black cells are covered in one segment.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum length for each test case. This is correct.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program correctly identifies the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.

### Conclusion:

- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- It accurately computes the minimum length required to paint all cells white.
- The logic for finding the first and last black cells and calculating the segment length is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
