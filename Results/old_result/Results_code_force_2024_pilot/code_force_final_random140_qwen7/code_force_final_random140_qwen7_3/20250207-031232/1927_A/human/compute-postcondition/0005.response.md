Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' does not exist in `s`, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' does not exist in `s`.**

The code `last_black = s.rfind('B')` finds the index of the last occurrence of the character 'B' in the string `s`. If 'B' does not exist in `s`, `last_black` will be set to -1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
