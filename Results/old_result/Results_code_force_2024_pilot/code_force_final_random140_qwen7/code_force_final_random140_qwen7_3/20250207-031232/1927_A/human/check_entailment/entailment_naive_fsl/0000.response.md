Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program calculates the distance between the first and last black cells but does not account for the possibility that there might be multiple segments of black cells that need to be painted. For instance, in the input "BWBBWW", the program would incorrectly output 4 instead of 3, as painting the segment from the 2nd to the 4th cell would suffice to make all cells white. Therefore, the program does not handle cases where there are multiple segments of black cells correctly.
