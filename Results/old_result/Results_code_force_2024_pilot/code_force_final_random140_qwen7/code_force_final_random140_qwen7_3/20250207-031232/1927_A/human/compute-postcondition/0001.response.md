State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is not yet defined, `s` and `n` are not yet defined**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so no adjustment is needed for `_`.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), the loop will execute `t` times if `t` is greater than 0.
- Variables `s` and `n` are not used in the loop head, so their initial states do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `t` must be greater than 0. However, since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it inherently ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Thus, no specific adjustment is needed beyond the given state.
