Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, `min_paint` is the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one, and `min_paint` is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`.**

The code updates the value of `min_paint` to be the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
