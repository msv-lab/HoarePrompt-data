Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, `t` is the input integer converted to an integer, `x` is a list of characters from the input string. If 'B' is in the list `x`, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B', and `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the reversed list `x`. If 'B' is not in the list `x`, no additional variables are introduced.**

This output state describes the final condition after the loop has executed all its iterations. Here's a breakdown:

- The loop runs for each iteration of `i` in the range of `n`.
- After 3 iterations, `i` will be 3.
- `n` remains an input integer between 1 and 10 inclusive.
- `t` is set to the integer value of the input provided during the current iteration of the loop.
- `x` is a list of characters from the input string provided during the current iteration of the loop.
- If the character 'B' is found in `x`, `start` and `end` are calculated as described (index of the first 'B' and the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list, respectively).
- If 'B' is not found in `x`, no new variables (`start` and `end`) are introduced, and `x` remains unchanged.
