Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strip \( n \) and the string \( s \) representing the strip's state.
3. The program uses `s.find('B')` to find the index of the first occurrence of 'B' and `s.rfind('B')` to find the index of the last occurrence of 'B'.
4. The difference between these two indices (`last_black - first_black + 1`) gives the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all black cells into white.
5. This approach works because painting a segment starting from the first 'B' to the last 'B' ensures that all black cells are covered, and no smaller segment can achieve this since there is at least one black cell in the strip.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program logic matches the requirements and correctly calculates the minimum segment length for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
