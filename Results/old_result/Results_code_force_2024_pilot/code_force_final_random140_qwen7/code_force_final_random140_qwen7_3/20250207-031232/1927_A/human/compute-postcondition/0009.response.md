Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' does not exist in `s`, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' does not exist in `s`, `min_paint` is the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
