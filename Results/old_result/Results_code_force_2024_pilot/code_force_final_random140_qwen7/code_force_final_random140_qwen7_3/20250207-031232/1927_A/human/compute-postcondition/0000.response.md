Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `s` and `n` are not yet defined**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input for `t` is not provided, we know that `t` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4]. However, the values of `n` and `s` remain undefined as they are not involved in the given code snippet.
