Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `last_black - first_black + 1` to the variable `min_paint`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `first_black`, and `last_black` remain unchanged from their initial states.
