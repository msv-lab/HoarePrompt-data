Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified.
- `s` is a new string input by the user, but its content is not specified.
- `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`.
- `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`.
- `min_paint` is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`.

The `print(min_paint)` statement will print the value of `min_paint`, which is the length of the substring between the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, inclusive.

Output: **last_black - first_black + 1 (where `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` and `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`)**
