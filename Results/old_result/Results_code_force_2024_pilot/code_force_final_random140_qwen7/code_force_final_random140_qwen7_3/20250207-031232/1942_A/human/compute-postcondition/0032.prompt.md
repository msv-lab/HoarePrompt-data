You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `n` and `k` will be the integers entered by the user for each test case, and these values will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `n` and `k` for each test case will be the same as the initial values provided for that test case.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop, the values of `n` and `k` will be the same as the values entered by the user for each test case, and these values will not be altered by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, where `n` and `k` are such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3, the function determines a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k` and returns it.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
