### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`n = 2`, `k = 2`):
     - The program checks if `n == k`. Since `n == k`, it prints `1 1`.
     - This solution is correct because both cyclic shifts `[1, 1]` are sorted.

   - For the second test case (`n = 3`, `k = 1`):
     - The program checks if `k == 1`. Since `k == 1`, it prints the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` (or any equivalent sequence where only one cyclic shift is sorted).
     - This solution is correct because the cyclic shift `[2, 3, 1]` is not sorted, but `[1, 2, 3]` is sorted.

   - For the third test case (`n = 3`, `k = 2`):
     - The program checks if `n == k`. Since `n != k`, and `k > 1`, it prints `-1`.
     - This solution is correct because it correctly identifies that no valid sequence exists for this case.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n == k` and `k == 1` correctly.
   - For other cases, it prints `-1`, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

3. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not provide a general solution for arbitrary values of `n` and `k` where `n != k` and `k > 1`. However, the problem statement guarantees that for these cases, no valid sequence exists, so printing `-1` is the correct approach.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the program does not actually generate a valid sequence for the case where `n != k` and `k > 1`. The program simply prints `-1` without attempting to find a valid sequence, which is not required by the problem statement. The problem statement asks for any valid array `a` that satisfies the conditions, and the program fails to do so for most cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles the edge cases and specific test cases mentioned, but it does not provide a general solution for the case where `n != k` and `k > 1`. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement for all cases.

**Final: False**
