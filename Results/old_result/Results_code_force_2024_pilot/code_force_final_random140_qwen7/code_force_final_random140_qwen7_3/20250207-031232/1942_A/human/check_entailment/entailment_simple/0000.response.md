Reasoning:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The program correctly iterates over each test case using a loop. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input, ensuring that the constraints are respected (i.e., `1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^3`).

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1 (`n == k`)**: The program prints `1 1 ... 1` (with `n` ones), which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted. This is correct.
   - **Case 2 (`k == 1`)**: The program prints a strictly increasing sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, which ensures only one cyclic shift is sorted. This is also correct.
   - **Case 3 (`k > 1 and k < n`)**: The program prints `-1`, indicating that no valid array exists for this scenario. This is correct based on the problem statement.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the required format for each test case, either printing the valid array or `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all specified cases and adheres to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
