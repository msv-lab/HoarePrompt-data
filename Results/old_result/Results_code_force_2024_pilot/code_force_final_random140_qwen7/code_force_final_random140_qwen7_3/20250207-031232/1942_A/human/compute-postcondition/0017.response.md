Given the initial state where `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) and `k` is an integer, both updated to the values entered by the user, the code snippet provided is:

```python
print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
```

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Range Generation**: The expression `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Incrementing Elements**: For each number `x` in this sequence, `x + 1` is computed. This means the sequence becomes 1, 2, 3, ..., n.

3. **String Conversion**: Each number in the sequence is converted to a string using `str(x + 1)`.

4. **Joining with Spaces**: The `join` method concatenates these strings into a single string, with each number separated by a space.

5. **Printing**: Finally, the resulting string is printed.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) and is updated to the value entered by the user, let's denote the value of `n` as `N` (where \(1 \leq N \leq 1000\)).

Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of numbers starting from 1 up to `N`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... N**
