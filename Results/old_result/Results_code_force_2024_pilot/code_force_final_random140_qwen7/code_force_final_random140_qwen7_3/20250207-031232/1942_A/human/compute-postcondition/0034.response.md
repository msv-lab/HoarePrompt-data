Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing integers n and k. It prints a sequence of numbers or -1 for each test case based on the values of n and k. Specifically, if k is 2 or greater and n equals k, it prints a sequence of k numbers, each being k. Otherwise, if k is less than 2 or n does not equal k, it prints a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1. The function reads and processes one line at a time until all lines have been processed.**
