You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `n` and `k` will be the integers entered by the user for each test case, and these values will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `n` and `k` for each test case will be the same as the initial values provided for that test case.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop, the values of `n` and `k` will be the same as the values entered by the user for each test case, and these values will not be altered by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \) and prints one of three possible outputs: a sequence of \( n \) ones separated by spaces, a sequence of integers starting from 2 up to \( n+1 \), or -1 if no valid output can be determined. After processing all test cases, the function does not alter the values of \( n \) and \( k \) from their initial inputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`n = 2`, `k = 2`):
     - The program checks if `n == k`. Since `n == k`, it prints `1 1`.
     - This solution is correct because both cyclic shifts `[1, 1]` are sorted.
   
   - For the second test case (`n = 3`, `k = 1`):
     - The program checks if `k == 1`. Since `k == 1`, it prints the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` (or any equivalent sequence where only one cyclic shift is sorted).
     - This solution is correct because the cyclic shift `[2, 3, 1]` is not sorted, but `[1, 2, 3]` is sorted.
   
   - For the third test case (`n = 3`, `k = 2`):
     - The program checks if `n == k`. Since `n != k`, and `k > 1`, it prints `-1`.
     - This solution is correct because it correctly identifies that no valid sequence exists for this case.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n == k` and `k == 1` correctly.
   - For other cases, it prints `-1`, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

3. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not provide a general solution for arbitrary values of `n` and `k` where `n != k` and `k > 1`. However, the problem statement guarantees that for these cases, no valid sequence exists, so printing `-1` is the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles all specified test cases and edge cases as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
