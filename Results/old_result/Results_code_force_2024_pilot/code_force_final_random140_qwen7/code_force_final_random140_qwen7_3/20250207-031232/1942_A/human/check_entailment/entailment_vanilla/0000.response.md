### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`n = 2`, `k = 2`):
     - The program checks if `n == k`. Since `n == k`, it prints `1 1`.
     - This solution is correct because both cyclic shifts `[1, 1]` are sorted.
   
   - For the second test case (`n = 3`, `k = 1`):
     - The program checks if `k == 1`. Since `k == 1`, it prints the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` (or any equivalent sequence where only one cyclic shift is sorted).
     - This solution is correct because the cyclic shift `[2, 3, 1]` is not sorted, but `[1, 2, 3]` is sorted.
   
   - For the third test case (`n = 3`, `k = 2`):
     - The program checks if `n == k`. Since `n != k`, and `k > 1`, it prints `-1`.
     - This solution is correct because it correctly identifies that no valid sequence exists for this case.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n == k` and `k == 1` correctly.
   - For other cases, it prints `-1`, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

3. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not provide a general solution for arbitrary values of `n` and `k` where `n != k` and `k > 1`. However, the problem statement guarantees that for these cases, no valid sequence exists, so printing `-1` is the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles all specified test cases and edge cases as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
