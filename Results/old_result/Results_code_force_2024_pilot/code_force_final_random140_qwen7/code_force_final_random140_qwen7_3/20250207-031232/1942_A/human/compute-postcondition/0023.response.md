Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and \(10^3\), and they are now set to the values of the two integers entered by the user separated by a space.**

The code takes two integers as input from the user, splits them based on a space, and converts each string into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The precondition that `n` and `k` are between 1 and \(10^3\) remains valid, and the specific values of `n` and `k` are now determined by the user's input.
