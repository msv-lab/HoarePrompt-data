Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \) and prints one of three possible outputs: a sequence of \( n \) ones separated by spaces, a sequence of integers starting from 2 up to \( n+1 \), or -1 if no valid output can be determined. After processing all test cases, the function does not alter the values of \( n \) and \( k \) from their initial inputs.**
