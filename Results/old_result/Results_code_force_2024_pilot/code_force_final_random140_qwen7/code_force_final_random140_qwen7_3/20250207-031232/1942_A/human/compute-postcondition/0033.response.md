Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, t represents the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of n and k.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for t, n, and k, and for each test case, it performs some operation (not specified here) using n and k, and returns the results accordingly.
