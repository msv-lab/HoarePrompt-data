Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be non-zero. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` is an input integer. Its value is not specified, but it is not needed for the code snippet execution.
   - `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. Since the input string is not provided, let's denote the elements of `A` as `A[0], A[1], A[2], ...`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum(A[::2]))
   ```
   - `A[::2]` means taking every second element from the list `A` starting from the first element (index 0).
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

Given the initial state, the code will print the sum of every second element in the list `A`.

Since the exact elements of `A` are not provided, we can represent the output in a general form.

Output: **sum of every second element in the list A (where A is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer)**
