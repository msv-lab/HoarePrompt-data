You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be reduced by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. Since the loop runs 3 times initially and each run decreases `t` by 1, after all iterations, `t` will be 0. The values of `n` and the list `A` will be as they were set during the last iteration of the loop, but since no further iterations occur, these values remain unchanged from their last state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that we add \(\min(x, y)\) to the score.
- The goal is to find the maximum score achievable by optimally selecting pairs.

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is read as the number of integers divided by 2.
   - `A` is read as a list of `2n` integers.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program prints `sum(A[::2])`, which means it sums every second element in the list `A`.

3. **Optimality Check**:
   - The program does not implement any strategy to choose the optimal pairs \((x, y)\).
   - Instead, it simply sums every second element in the list, which is not necessarily the optimal solution.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (`n = 1`, `A = [2, 3]`), the sum of every second element is `2 + 3[1] = 2`.
   - For the second test case (`n = 2`, `A = [1, 1, 2, 1]`), the sum of every second element is `1 + 2 = 2`.
   - For the third test case (`n = 3`, `A = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`), the sum of every second element is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not consider the optimal way to pair elements to maximize the score.
- The approach of summing every second element is not guaranteed to give the maximum score for all possible inputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
