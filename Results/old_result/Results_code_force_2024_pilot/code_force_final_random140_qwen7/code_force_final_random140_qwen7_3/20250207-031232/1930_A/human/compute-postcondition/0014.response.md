Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a non-zero value. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.
   - `n` is an input integer. This variable is also not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.
   - `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers. Since the actual input string is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values in the list `A`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum(A[::2]))
   ```

   - `A[::2]` means slicing the list `A` with a step of 2, starting from the first element. So, it takes every second element from the list `A`.
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

Given the above breakdown, since the exact values in the list `A` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements in `A`.

**Output:** **sum of every second element in the list A**
