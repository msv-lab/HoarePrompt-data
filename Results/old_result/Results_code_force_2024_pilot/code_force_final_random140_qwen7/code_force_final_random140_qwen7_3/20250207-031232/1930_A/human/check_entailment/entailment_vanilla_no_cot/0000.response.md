Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The logic in the function `func()` sums every other element in the list starting from the first element (`A[::2]`), which is not equivalent to the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.

To maximize the score, you should always choose the smallest pair of numbers available at each step. This means sorting the list and then summing up every second element after pairing them optimally. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()  # Sort the array to always pick the smallest pairs
        score = sum(A[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))  # Sum every second element after sorting
        print(score)
        t = t - 1

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the numbers are paired optimally to maximize the score.
