Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum(A[::2]))
   ```

   This line of code prints the sum of every second element in the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).

3. **Explanation**:
   - `A[::2]` means we take every second element from the list `A`, starting from the first element.
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

Given the initial state, we know that `A` is a list of integers derived from an input string. However, the specific values of `A` are not provided. Therefore, we need to express the output in terms of the elements of `A`.

The output will be the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list `A`.

Output: **sum of elements at even indices of list A**
