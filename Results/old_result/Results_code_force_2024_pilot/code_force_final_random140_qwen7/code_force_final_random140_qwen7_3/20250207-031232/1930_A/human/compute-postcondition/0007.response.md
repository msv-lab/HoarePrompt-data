Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` and `A` remains unchanged, and the new state of `n` is the integer input provided by the user.
