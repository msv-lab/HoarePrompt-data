Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, splits the string into individual elements, converts each element back to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `A`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
