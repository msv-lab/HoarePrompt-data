Output State: **`t` must be a non-zero value, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be a non-zero value, and `A` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
