Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `t` remains 0**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `i`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
