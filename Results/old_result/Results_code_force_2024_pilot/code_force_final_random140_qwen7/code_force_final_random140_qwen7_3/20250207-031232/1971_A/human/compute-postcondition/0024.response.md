Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` remains greater than 0 (though its exact value is not specified)
- `a` is an integer entered by the user
- `b` is an integer entered by the user
- `t` remains 0 (though it is not used in the print statement)

The print statement `print(a, ' ', b)` will print the values of `a` and `b` with a space in between.
