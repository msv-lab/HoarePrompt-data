Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are set to the integers entered by the user.
