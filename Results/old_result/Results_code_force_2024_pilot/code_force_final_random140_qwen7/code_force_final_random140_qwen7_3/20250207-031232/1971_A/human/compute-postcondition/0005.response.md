Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

This means that the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers entered by the user, while the precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
