Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `t` remains 0.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `t`. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `n` remains greater than 0, `a` and `b` are now the integers entered by the user, and `t` remains 0.
