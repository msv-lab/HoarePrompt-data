Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables (`x` and `y`) remain unchanged and are still within their specified ranges (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).
