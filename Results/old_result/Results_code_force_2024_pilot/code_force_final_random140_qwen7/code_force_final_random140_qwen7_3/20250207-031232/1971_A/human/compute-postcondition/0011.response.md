Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and this process is repeated for each iteration up to the value of `t`. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the maximum and minimum values from all the pairs of integers input during the loop executions, respectively.
