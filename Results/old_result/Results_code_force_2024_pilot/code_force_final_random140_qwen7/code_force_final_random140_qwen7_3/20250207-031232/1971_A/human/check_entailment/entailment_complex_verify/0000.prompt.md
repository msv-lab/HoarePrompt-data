You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and this process is repeated for each iteration up to the value of `t`. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the maximum and minimum values from all the pairs of integers input during the loop executions, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of integer pairs from the user, prints the maximum and minimum values of each pair, and repeats this process for a number of times specified by the user (t). After all iterations, the final printed values are the maximum and minimum values from all the pairs of integers input during the loop executions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. According to the problem description, for each test case, the program should output the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. However, the current implementation prints the maximum followed by the minimum, which is the opposite of what is required. For example, for the input `1 9`, the program outputs `9 1` instead of `1 9`.
