### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`, ensuring that `t` is an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: It then iterates `t` times using `for _ in range(t)` to handle each test case.
3. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` separated by a space using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the input is correctly parsed into two integers.
4. **Output Calculation**: Inside the loop, it calculates the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b` using `max(a, b)` and `min(a, b)` respectively.
5. **Output Formatting**: It prints the maximum value followed by the minimum value, which matches the required format.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code, there is a subtle issue with the final state description. The annotated code states that after all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the maximum and minimum values from all the pairs of integers input during the loop executions. This is not accurate because `a` and `b` are local variables within the loop and are redefined for each test case. Therefore, the final values of `a` and `b` after the loop will be the values from the last test case, not the overall maximum and minimum values from all test cases.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program correctly handles the input and output for each individual test case but does not compute the overall maximum and minimum values across all test cases as the annotation suggests.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
