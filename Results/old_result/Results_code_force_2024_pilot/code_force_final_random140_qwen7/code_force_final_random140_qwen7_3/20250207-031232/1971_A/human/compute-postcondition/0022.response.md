Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` remains greater than 0
   - `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user (their values do not change within the loop)
   - `t` remains 0 (its value does not change within the loop)

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` remains greater than 0, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to check if it is still less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now 2
   - `n` remains greater than 0
   - `a` and `b` remain as entered by the user
   - `t` remains 0

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `t` remains 0**.
