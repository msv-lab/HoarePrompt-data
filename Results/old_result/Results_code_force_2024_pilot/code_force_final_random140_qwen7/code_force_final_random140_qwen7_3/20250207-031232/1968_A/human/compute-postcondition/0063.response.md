Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + num - 1`, and `res` is a list with `num` elements. Each element in `res` is calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` if `L1[i] % j == 0`, otherwise it is `None`. Since the loop runs from `j = 2` to `j = L1[i] + 1`, the final value of `j` will be `L1[i] + num - 1`. Therefore, the last element of `res` will be `(L1[i] // (L1[i] + num - 1)) * ((L1[i] + num - 1) - 1)`. All previous elements in `res` will follow the same pattern based on the value of `j` during each iteration.
