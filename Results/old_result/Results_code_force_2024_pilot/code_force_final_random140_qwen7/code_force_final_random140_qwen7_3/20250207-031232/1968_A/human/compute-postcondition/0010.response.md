Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and all the elements in `L1` are the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user, and `i` will be set to `num + 1`. The variables `t`, `x`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
