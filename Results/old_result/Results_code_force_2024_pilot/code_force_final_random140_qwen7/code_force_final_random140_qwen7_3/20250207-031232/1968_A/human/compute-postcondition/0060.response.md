The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or if statement mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + 2`, and `res` is a list with three elements where the second element is equal to `(L1[i] // (L1[i] + 2)) * ((L1[i] + 2) - 1)` and the third element is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
