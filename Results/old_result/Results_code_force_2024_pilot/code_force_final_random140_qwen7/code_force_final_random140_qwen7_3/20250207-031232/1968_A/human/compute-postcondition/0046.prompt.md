Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing multiple elements, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and all the elements in `L1` are the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
    if L1[i] % j == 0:
        res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one additional element, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 1. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` remains 0.5, `i` remains 1, `j` remains 2, `t` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and `L1` remains unchanged. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` remains 0.5, `i` remains 1, `j` is 3, `t` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and `L1` remains unchanged. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
