Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `num`, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1` has been completely filled with `num` entries from the user.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be equal to `num` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `num`. The variables `t`, `x`, and `res` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
