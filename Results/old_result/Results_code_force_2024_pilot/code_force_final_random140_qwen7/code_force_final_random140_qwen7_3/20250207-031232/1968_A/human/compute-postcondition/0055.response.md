Output State: **`L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + 1`, and `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is equal to `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `res`. The new element is calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)`, where `j` is `L1[i] + 1`. This means the list `res` now has one more element than before, and the second element of `res` is updated to this new value. The values of `L1`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
