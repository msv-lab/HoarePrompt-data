Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one additional element which is `L1[1] // (j + 1) * j`, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[1]` is at least 1 and divisible by `j + 1`. `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `res` the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` where `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, the expression becomes `L1[1] // j * (j - 1)`. The value of `j` is updated to `j + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
