The code `break` is executed, which does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the current loop or conditional block. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one additional element which is `L1[1] // (j + 1) * j`, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[1]` is at least 1 and divisible by `j + 1`. `j` is `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
