Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the nested loops is flawed for finding the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) where \(1 \leq y < x\).

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD**: The program attempts to find a divisor `j` of `L1[i]` and then calculates `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` as a potential candidate for `y`. This approach does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Maximizing \(\gcd(x, y) + y\)**: The goal is to find the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \leq y < x\). The current logic does not ensure that the calculated `y` maximizes this expression.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of `y` from 1 to `x-1` and calculate \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for each `y`. We should keep track of the maximum value and the corresponding `y`.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    res = []
    for _ in range(num):
        x = int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(_ + 1) + '- '))
        max_val = 0
        best_y = 0
        for y in range(1, x):
            current_val = gcd(x, y) + y
            if current_val > max_val:
                max_val = current_val
                best_y = y
        res.append(best_y)
    print(*res, sep='\n')

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible values of `y` and finds the one that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
