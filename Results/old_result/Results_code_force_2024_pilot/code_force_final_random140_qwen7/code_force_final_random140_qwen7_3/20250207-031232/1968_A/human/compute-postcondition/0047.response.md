Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user.
   - `res` is a list containing multiple elements.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `L1[2]` is at least 4.
   - There exists some `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[2]` such that `L1[2] % j == 0`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `L1` starting from index `i = 0`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < num`.

3. **Current Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop has executed 3 times, meaning `i` is currently 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `num`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - `num` remains unchanged.
   - `L1[2]` must still be at least 4.
   - There must still exist some `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[2]` such that `L1[2] % j == 0`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `L1[2]` must still be at least 4.
   - The conditions for `res` and `t` and `x` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing multiple elements, `i` is 3, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[2]` is at least 4.**
