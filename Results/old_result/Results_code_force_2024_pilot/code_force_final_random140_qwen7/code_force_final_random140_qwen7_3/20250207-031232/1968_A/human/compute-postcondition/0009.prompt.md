Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer, `L1` is an empty list, `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(num):
    L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing one element which is an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `num` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `L1` is a list containing two elements which are integers entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `num` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing three elements (the original two plus one new element entered by the user), `res` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `num` is an input integer greater than 4, a new element is appended to `L1` which is the integer input by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
