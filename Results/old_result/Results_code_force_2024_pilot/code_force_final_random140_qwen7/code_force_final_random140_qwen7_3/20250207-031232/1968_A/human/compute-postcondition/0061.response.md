Postcondition: **`L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + 2`, and `res` is a list with three elements where the second element is equal to `(L1[i] // (L1[i] + 2)) * ((L1[i] + 2) - 1)`. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, the third element of `res` is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Otherwise, the third element of `res` remains as `None`.**
