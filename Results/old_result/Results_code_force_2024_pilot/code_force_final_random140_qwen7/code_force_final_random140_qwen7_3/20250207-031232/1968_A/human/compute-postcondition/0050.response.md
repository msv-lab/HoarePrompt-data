Output State: **`L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer, `res` is a list with one additional element which is equal to `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)`**.

The value of `L1[i]` is divided by `j`, then the result is multiplied by `(j - 1)`, and the outcome is appended to the list `res`. The values of `L1`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
