Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one additional element, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `L1[i]` is at least 1, and the current value of `L1[i] % j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `res`. The element appended is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Since `i` was initially 0 and the code increments `i` by 1, now `i` is 1. The value of `res` has changed by adding one more element, which is the result of the calculation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
