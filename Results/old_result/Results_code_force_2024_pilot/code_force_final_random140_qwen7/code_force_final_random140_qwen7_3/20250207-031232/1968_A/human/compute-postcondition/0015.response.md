The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, the only thing we can infer is that the execution is broken out of the most internal loop or structure it was in. However, since no loop or conditional block is specified, we assume the `break` statement is outside any such structure, meaning the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 1 and divisible by `j`.**
