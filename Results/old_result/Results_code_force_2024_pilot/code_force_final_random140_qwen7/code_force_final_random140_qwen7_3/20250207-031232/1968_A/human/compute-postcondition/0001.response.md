Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer, `L1` is an empty list.**

The code creates an empty list `L1`, which does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, or `num`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
