Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing multiple elements, each calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` where `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` and `j` ranges from 2 to `L1[i]`, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations minus 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and all elements in `L1` are the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` and `x` remain unchanged within their specified ranges. The list `L1` remains the same as initially provided. The list `res` will contain multiple elements, each computed based on the rule inside the loop for every `L1[i]` where `i` starts from 0 up to `num-1` (the total number of iterations). Each element in `res` is derived from dividing `L1[i]` by some divisor `j` (ranging from 2 to `L1[i]`), multiplying the result by `(j - 1)`, and adding it to `res` only if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. The variable `i` will be set to `num - 1` after all iterations, and `num` remains unchanged.
