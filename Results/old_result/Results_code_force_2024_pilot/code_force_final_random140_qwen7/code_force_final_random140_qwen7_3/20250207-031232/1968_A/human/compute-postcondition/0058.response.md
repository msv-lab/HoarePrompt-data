Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `L1[i]`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i] + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `L1` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the list `L1`.
   - `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + 1`.
   - `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is equal to `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is `j <= L1[i] + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `L1[i] + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `L1[i]` remains the same because it is an index into the list `L1`.
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value, which is `L1[i] + 1`.

So, the new state for the next iteration should be:
- `L1` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` becomes `L1[i] + 2`.
- `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`L1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `L1`, `j` is an integer equal to `L1[i] + 2`, and `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is equal to `(L1[i] // (L1[i] + 2)) * ((L1[i] + 2) - 1)`**.
