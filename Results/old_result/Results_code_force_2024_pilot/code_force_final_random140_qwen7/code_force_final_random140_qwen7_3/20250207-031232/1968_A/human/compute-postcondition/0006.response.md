Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `L1` is a list containing two elements which are integers entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `num` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code appends an integer entered by the user to the list `L1`. Initially, `L1` contains one element. After appending, `L1` now contains two elements. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
