Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `L1` is a list containing as many elements as the value of `num`, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, and `L1[i]` is at least 1 and divisible by `j`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `res` the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. This means that the value of `L1[i]` is divided by `j`, then multiplied by `(j - 1)`, and the result is added to `res`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
