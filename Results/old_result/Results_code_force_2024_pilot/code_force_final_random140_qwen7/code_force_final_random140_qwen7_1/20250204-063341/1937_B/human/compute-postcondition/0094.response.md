Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1 if `a[len(a) - 1]` is '0' and `b[len(a) - 2]` is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is `True`.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is assigned the value `True`, which means it is set to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `j`, `counter`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
