Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by alternating characters from the two input strings based on specific conditions. After constructing `ans`, it counts the maximum consecutive occurrences of matching characters between the two input strings and prints both `ans` and the count. The function iterates through all test cases, processing each one independently.**
