Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is `a[0]`, `work` is True**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes `a[0]`. The values of `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `work` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is updated to 1 (since we've already used the first character), `ans` now contains the first character of `a`, and `work` remains True.
