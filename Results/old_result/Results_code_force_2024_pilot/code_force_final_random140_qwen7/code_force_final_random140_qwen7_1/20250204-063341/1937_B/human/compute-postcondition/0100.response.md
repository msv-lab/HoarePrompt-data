Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1 if `a[len(a) - 1]` is '0' and `b[len(a) - 2]` is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the string `a[i-1]` appended to the original `ans`, `work` is `False`, and the length of `a` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
