Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is constructed by alternating characters from strings `a` and `b` based on the given conditions, `work` is `False`, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, counter is 1.**

Explanation: The code `counter = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `counter`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `i`, `ans`, `work`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `counter` is now set to 1.
