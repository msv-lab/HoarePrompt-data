Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `b[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `ans` is being updated by adding `b[i]`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the loop or conditional block is exited.
