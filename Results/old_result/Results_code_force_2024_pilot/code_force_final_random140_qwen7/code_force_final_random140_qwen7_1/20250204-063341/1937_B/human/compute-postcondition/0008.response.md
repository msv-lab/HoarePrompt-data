Output State: **`i` is 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True.**

The variable `work` is assigned the boolean value `True`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
