Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, and `work` remains `False`.**

The code initializes `ans` as an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
