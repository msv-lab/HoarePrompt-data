Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is 2, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
