Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `a[i]`, `work` is False**

Explanation: The variable `work` is set to `False`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition that `i` is less than `len(a)` and `ans` is `ans` plus `a[i]` still holds true.
