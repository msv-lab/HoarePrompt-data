Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` must be less than `len(a)` in the initial state, this condition remains true after the operation. The value of `ans` is updated to its original value plus `a[i]`.
