Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, `work` is False, and the current value of `a[j + 1]` is equal to the current value of `b[j]`**.
