Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns the result to `b`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
