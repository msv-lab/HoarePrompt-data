Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1 if `a[len(a) - 1]` is '0' and `b[len(a) - 2]` is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i`, `j`, `counter`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` retain their values as described in the precondition. If `work` is `True` and `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `i` becomes 2, `ans` is updated to append `a[i-1]` to the original `ans`, and `work` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `i` remains either `len(a)` or 2, `ans` is updated to append `a[i]` or `b[i]` to the original `ans`, and `work` remains `True`. If `work` is `False`, then `i` is 1, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1 if `a[len(a) - 1]` is '0' and `b[len(a) - 2]` is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is equal to `b[0]`, and `work` is `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is incremented by either `b[i]` if `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, or by `a[i]` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` or the condition `b[i] < a[i + 1]` is not met, or `ans` is incremented by `b[i - 1]` if `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is increased by either `a[i] + b[i]` if `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, or `a[i-1]` if `i` is incremented by 1, or `b[i]` if `i` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
