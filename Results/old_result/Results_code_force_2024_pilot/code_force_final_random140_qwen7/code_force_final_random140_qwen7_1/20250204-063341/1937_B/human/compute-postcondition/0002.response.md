State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is mentioned as being an integer input from `sys.stdin.readline` and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that for the loop to execute, `t` must satisfy this condition.
- The loop variable `_` is a common placeholder used when the loop variable itself is not needed within the loop body. It is automatically incremented with each iteration of the loop. At the start of the loop, `_` is effectively set to 1 because the loop runs `t` times.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is within the specified range, and `_` is initialized to 1.
