Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + b[1]` depending on whether `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True if `i + 1` equals the length of `a` and we break out of the loop, otherwise `work` remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `ans` is `b[0]` if `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
