Output State: **`j` is 0; `counter` is 1; the length of `a` is greater than 1, and the current value of `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`**

Explanation: The code increments the `counter` variable by 1. Initially, `counter` is 0, so after executing `counter += 1`, `counter` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
