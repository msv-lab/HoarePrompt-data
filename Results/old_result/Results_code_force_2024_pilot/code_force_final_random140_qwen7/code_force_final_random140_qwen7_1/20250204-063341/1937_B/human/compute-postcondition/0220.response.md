Output State: **`ans` is increased by `b[i]`, `i` must be less than `len(a)`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `b[i]`. The condition that `i` must be less than `len(a)` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `i` or `a`. Therefore, the updated state includes that `ans` has been increased by `b[i]` and `i` must still be less than `len(a)`.
