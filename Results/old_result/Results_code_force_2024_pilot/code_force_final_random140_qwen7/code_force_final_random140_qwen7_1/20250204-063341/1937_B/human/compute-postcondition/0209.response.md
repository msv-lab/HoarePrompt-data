Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is either `i + 1` or equals `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the concatenation of `ans` and either `b[i]` or `a[i]`, and `work` is `False` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` remains `True` or `False` depending on the condition in the if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes after executing the if-else block. It covers both the if and else parts, ensuring that the final state of the variables (`j`, `counter`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work`) is accurately described based on the conditions provided.
