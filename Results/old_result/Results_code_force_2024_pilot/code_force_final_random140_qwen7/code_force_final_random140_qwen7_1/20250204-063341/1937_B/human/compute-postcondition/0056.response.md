Postcondition: `ans` is updated based on the value of `i` and the elements of arrays `a` and `b`. If `work` is True and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is False or other conditions are met, `ans` is updated to its current value plus the value of `b[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1.
