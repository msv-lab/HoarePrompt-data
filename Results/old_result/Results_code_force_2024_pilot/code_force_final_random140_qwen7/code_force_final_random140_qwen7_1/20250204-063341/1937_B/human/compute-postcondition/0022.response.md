Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is `a[0]`, `work` is `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. The values of `ans` and `work` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. Therefore, `ans` is still `a[0]`, and `work` remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`.
