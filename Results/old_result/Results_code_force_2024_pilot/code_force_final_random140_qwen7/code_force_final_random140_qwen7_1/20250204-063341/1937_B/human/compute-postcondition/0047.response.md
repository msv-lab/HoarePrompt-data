Output State: **`ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the current value of `b[i]` to it. The variable `i` is also incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. After executing the code, `ans` will now be the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]` (since `a[i]` was replaced by `b[i]`), and `i` will be increased by 1.
