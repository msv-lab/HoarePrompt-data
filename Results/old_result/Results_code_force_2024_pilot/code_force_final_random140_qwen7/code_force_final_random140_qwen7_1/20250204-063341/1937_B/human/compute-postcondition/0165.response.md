Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is either 2 or 3, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, and `work` is `False`.**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `counter` is either 1 or 2, after adding 1, `counter` will be either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
