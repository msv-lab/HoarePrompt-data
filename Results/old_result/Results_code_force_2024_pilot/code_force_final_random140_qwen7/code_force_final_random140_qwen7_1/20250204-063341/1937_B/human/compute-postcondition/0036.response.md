Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `ans` is `ans + b[i]`; `work` is either `True` or remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`; `_` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be at least 3; `b` is the stripped input string from user; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement it is within. All other variables retain their initial states.
