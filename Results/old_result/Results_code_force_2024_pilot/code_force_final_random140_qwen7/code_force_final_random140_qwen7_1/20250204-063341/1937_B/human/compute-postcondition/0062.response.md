Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: According to the given state, `i` is equal to `len(a)`. Since `j` starts from 0 (as implied by the typical behavior of `range` in Python), we need to ensure that `j` is within the range `0` to `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < len(a) - 1`. Therefore, `j` must be less than `len(a) - 1` for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial value of `j`**: Given that `i` is equal to `len(a)`, and `j` starts from 0, `j` is initially 0. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.

5. **Other variables**: The other variables (`ans`, `work`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `counter`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `len(a)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 1**
