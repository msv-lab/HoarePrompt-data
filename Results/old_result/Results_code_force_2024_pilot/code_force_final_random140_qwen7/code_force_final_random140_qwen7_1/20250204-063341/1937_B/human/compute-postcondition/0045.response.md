Output State: **`ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `a[i]`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `ans` and `a[i]`, we only know that `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`. Additionally, the code does not explicitly show an increment for `i`, but typically such an operation would be part of a loop context (e.g., `for i in range(len(a))`), so we assume `i` is also being incremented by 1.
