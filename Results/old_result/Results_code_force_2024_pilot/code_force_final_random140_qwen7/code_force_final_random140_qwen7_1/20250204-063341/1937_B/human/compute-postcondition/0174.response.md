Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, and `work` remains `False`, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result back to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
