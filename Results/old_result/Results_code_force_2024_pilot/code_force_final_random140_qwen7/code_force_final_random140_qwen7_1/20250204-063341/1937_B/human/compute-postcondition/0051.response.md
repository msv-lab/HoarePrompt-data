Postcondition: `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is updated accordingly and `i` is incremented.
