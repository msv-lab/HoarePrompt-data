Output State: **`j` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 1, `counter` is 1, and `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1' condition remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `counter = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `counter`. This changes the value of `counter` from its previous value (which was 2 if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', otherwise unchanged) to 1. All other variables (`j`, `len(a)`, `a[j + 1]`, and `b[j]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
