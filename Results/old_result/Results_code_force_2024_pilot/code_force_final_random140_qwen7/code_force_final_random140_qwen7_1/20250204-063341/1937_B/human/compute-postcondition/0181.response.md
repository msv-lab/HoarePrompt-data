Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is 1, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, and `work` is `True`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` concatenates the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so the first character of `a` is added to `ans`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code, it is implied by the nature of the operation in a loop context), making `i` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
