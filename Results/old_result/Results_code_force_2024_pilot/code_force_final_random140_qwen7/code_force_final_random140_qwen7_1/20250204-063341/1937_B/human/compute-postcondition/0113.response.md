Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `counter`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` retain their values as described in the precondition. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `i` becomes 2, `ans` is updated to append `a[i-1]` to the original `ans`, and `work` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `i` remains either `len(a)` or 2, `ans` is updated to append `a[i]` or `b[i]` to the original `ans`, and `work` remains `True`.
