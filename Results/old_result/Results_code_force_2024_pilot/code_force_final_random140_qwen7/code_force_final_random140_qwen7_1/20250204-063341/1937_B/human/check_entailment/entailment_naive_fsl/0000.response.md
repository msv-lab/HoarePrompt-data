Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the logic for constructing the smallest string is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Construction of Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program attempts to construct the smallest string by alternating between `a` and `b`, but it fails to handle cases where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are '1'. In such cases, the program should choose `a[i]` to ensure the lexicographically smallest string, but it incorrectly chooses `b[i]`.

2. **Example Counterexample:**
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     2
     11
     10
     11
     01
     ```
   - The expected output should be:
     ```
     10
     2
     ```
   - However, the program outputs:
     ```
     11
     1
     ```
   - This happens because the program incorrectly chooses `b[1]` as '1' instead of '0', leading to the wrong smallest string and path count.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the condition where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are '1' by always choosing `a[i]` to ensure the lexicographically smallest string.
