Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus the value of `b[i]`, and `i` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `b[i]` to it. The index `i` is used to access an element in the list `b`. Since no other variables are mentioned, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is updated, and `i` remains the same.
