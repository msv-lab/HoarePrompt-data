Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, and `work` is `False`. If `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'` is true, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
