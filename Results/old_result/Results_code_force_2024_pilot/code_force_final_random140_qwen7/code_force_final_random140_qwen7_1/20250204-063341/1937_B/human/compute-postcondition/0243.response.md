Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is 3, `i` is `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the final concatenated result based on the conditions inside the loop, and `work` is `True`. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is true, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
