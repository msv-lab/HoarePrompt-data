You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by alternating characters from the two input strings based on specific conditions. After constructing `ans`, it counts the maximum consecutive occurrences of matching characters between the two input strings and prints both `ans` and the count. The function iterates through all test cases, processing each one independently.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the binary string for the first row (`a`), and the binary string for the second row (`b`).

2. **Finding Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest path.
   - It uses a flag `work` to determine whether to take a path from the current cell in the first row or the second row.
   - The loop iterates through the cells of the grid:
     - If `work` is true, it appends the current cell value from the first row to `ans`.
     - It checks if moving to the next cell in the first row would result in a lexicographically smaller path. If so, it continues with the first row. Otherwise, it switches to the second row.
     - If `work` is false, it appends the current cell value from the second row to `ans`.

3. **Counting Paths:**
   - After constructing the lexicographically smallest path, the program counts the number of paths that yield this string.
   - It initializes a counter `counter` to 1.
   - It iterates through the cells of the grid (excluding the last cell) and increments the counter if the current cell in the first row matches the current cell in the second row.
   - If the current cell in the first row is '0' and the current cell in the second row is '1', it resets the counter to 1.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Work Flag:**
   - The logic for determining whether to switch rows is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:` should be `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] <= a[i + 1]:`. This ensures that if the next cell in the second row is less than or equal to the next cell in the first row, we switch to the second row.

2. **Path Counting Logic:**
   - The counting logic is incorrect. The counter should only be incremented when the current cell in the first row matches the current cell in the second row, and it should reset to 1 only when the current cell in the first row is '0' and the current cell in the second row is '1'. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        ans = ''
        i = 0
        work = True
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] <= a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        print(ans)
        counter = 1
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
        print(counter)


func()
```
