Output State: **`i` is 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `ans` is `b[0]`, `work` is False**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` is updated to be the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
