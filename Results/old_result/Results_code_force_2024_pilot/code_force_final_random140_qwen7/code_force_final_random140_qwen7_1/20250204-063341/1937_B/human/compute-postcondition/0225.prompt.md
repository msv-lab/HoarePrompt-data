Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is 0, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, and `work` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is either 1, 2, or `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is either the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[i]` (if `i + 1 != len(a)`) or the previous value of `ans` (if `i + 1 == len(a)`), and `work` is `True` or `False` depending on the condition in the if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is either `i + 1` or equals `len(a)`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the concatenation of `ans` and either `b[i]` or `a[i]`, and `work` is `False` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` remains `True` or `False` depending on the condition in the if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(a)`, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[i]` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, or `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `b[i]` if `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, or `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[i-1]` if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, or `ans` is increased by `b[i]` and `i` is increased by 1 if the condition `work` is false.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
