Output State: **`ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state mentions that `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. After executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` is updated, but the relationship between `ans` and `a[i]` remains the same as described in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is as stated above.
