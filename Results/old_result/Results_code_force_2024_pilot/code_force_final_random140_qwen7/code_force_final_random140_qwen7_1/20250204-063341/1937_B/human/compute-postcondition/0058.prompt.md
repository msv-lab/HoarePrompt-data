Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + b[1]` depending on whether `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True if `i + 1` equals the length of `a` and we break out of the loop, otherwise `work` remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `ans` is `b[0]` if `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is either 1, 2, or 3; `ans` is either `a[0] + a[1]`, `a[0] + b[1] + a[1]`, `ans + b[i]`, `a[0] + b[2]`, or `a[0] + b[1] + b[2]`; `work` is either `False` or remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`; `_` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be at least 3; `b` is the stripped input string from user.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `ans` is the sum of elements from arrays `a` and `b` based on the value of `i`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False, and `i` is incremented. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is updated to include the value of `b[i]` and `i` is incremented, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the if condition is not met, `ans` is updated to include the value of `b[i]` and `i` is incremented.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
