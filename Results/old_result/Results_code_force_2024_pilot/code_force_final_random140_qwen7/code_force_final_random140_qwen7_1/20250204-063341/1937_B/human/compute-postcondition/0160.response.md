Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, and `work` is `False`**.

The value of `counter` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
