Reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func()` correctly processes each test case by alternating characters from the two binary strings (`a` and `b`) based on specific conditions to form the lexicographically smallest string (`ans`). It also correctly counts the number of paths that yield this string.

2. **Conditions for Alternation**:
   - When `work` is `True`, the function prefers characters from the first row (`a`).
   - If the next character in the first row (`a[i+1]`) is greater than the current character in the second row (`b[i]`), it switches to the second row (`b`).
   - This ensures that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.

3. **Path Count Calculation**:
   - The function counts the maximum consecutive occurrences of matching characters between `a` and `b`.
   - This count represents the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates through each character in the strings, updating `ans` and `counter` accordingly.
   - The loop terminates when all characters are processed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when the entire path is taken from one row or the other, ensuring the lexicographically smallest string is formed.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
