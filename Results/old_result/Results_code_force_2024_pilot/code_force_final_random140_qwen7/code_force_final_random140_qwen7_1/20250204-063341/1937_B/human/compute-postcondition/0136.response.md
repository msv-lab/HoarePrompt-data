Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is increased by `a[i] + b[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` adds the value of `b[i]` to the current value of `ans`. Since `i` is less than `len(a)` in the initial state, the value of `i` remains the same, but `ans` is updated to its original value plus `a[i] + b[i]`.
