Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `j` and the condition involving `len(a)` are the key elements here.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = len(a) - 2`. This means the loop continues as long as `j < len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `len(a)` is greater than 1
   - `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` was 0 in the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `len(a) - 1`. Given that `len(a)` is greater than 1, `len(a) - 1` is a positive number, and `j` being 1 is valid.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - The condition for `counter` remains the same unless the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` change, but since no such change is mentioned, `counter` will remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `len(a)` remains greater than 1.
   - `counter` remains unchanged based on the previous condition.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.**
