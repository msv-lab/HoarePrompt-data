Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the loop's conditions, and `work` remains `False`, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads a new input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
