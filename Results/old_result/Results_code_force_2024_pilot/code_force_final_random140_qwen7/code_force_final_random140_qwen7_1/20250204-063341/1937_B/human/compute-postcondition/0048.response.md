Output State: **`ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `ans` remains the same as it was before the `break` statement, which is the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]`. Similarly, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in.
