Postcondition: `i` is 2, `ans` is `a[0]` or `a[0] + b[1]` depending on whether `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True if `i + 1` equals the length of `a` and we break out of the loop or if the condition `i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]` is false, otherwise `work` is `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`.
