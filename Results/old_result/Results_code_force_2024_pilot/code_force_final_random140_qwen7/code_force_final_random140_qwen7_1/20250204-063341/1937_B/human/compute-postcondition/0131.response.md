Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(a)`, and `ans` is incremented by either `b[i]` if `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, or by `a[i]` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` or the condition `b[i] < a[i + 1]` is not met. Alternatively, `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by `b[i - 1]`.
