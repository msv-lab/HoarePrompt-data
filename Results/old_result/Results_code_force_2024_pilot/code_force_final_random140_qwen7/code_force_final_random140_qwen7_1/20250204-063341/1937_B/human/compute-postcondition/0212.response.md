Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[i]`, `work` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is set to `False`, which does not affect the values of `i` or `ans`. The value of `i` remains less than `len(a)`, and `ans` is still the original value of `ans` plus `a[i]`.
