Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is between 2 and 3 inclusive, `i` is 0, `t` is 3, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is `b[0]`, and `work` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is 0, `ans` is updated to be the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
