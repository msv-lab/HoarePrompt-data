Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `b[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `b[i]`. Since `i` is already less than `len(a)`, the index `i` is valid for accessing the list `b`. The state of `i` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to its current value plus `b[i]`.
