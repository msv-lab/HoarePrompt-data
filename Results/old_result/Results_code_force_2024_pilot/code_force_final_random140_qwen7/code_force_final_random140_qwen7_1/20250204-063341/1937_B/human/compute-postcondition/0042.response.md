Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is either `a[0] + b[i]` or `a[0] + b[1] + b[i]`, `work` is either `True` or remains as `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])`, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user and its length must be at least 3, `b` is the stripped input string from user**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 1 or 2, now `i` is either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.
