You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations with `j` being equal to `len(a) - 1`, `counter` holding the maximum value it reached during the loop execution, `i` being `len(a)`, `t` is 3 (since we only consider up to the third iteration in the given states), `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `ans` is the final concatenated result based on the conditions inside the loop, and `work` is `False` if the loop terminated because `i + 1` was equal to `len(a)`, or it follows the last condition checked before the loop terminated.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop will have processed all inputs `t` times, with each iteration updating the variables according to the specified logic. The final values of `j`, `counter`, `i`, `ans`, and `work` will reflect the outcome of the last iteration or the highest value `counter` reached during any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by alternating characters from the two input strings based on specific conditions. After constructing `ans`, it counts the maximum consecutive occurrences of matching characters between the two input strings and prints both `ans` and the count. The function iterates through all test cases, processing each one independently.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the logic for constructing the smallest string is flawed. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Construction of Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program attempts to construct the smallest string by alternating between `a` and `b`, but it fails to handle cases where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are '1'. In such cases, the program should choose `a[i]` to ensure the lexicographically smallest string, but it incorrectly chooses `b[i]`.

2. **Example Counterexample:**
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     2
     11
     10
     11
     01
     ```
   - The expected output should be:
     ```
     10
     2
     ```
   - However, the program outputs:
     ```
     11
     1
     ```
   - This happens because the program incorrectly chooses `b[1]` as '1' instead of '0', leading to the wrong smallest string and path count.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the condition where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are '1' by always choosing `a[i]` to ensure the lexicographically smallest string.
