Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user**.

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` reads an input from the user and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, and `n` remains an input integer. The new variable `a` is assigned the stripped input string.
