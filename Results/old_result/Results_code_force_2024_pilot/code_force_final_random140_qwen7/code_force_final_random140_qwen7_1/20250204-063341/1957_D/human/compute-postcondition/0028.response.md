Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 32, `suf[0][0]` is 1, and `(cur >> j & 1)` is False**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0 initially, `suf[0][0]` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `j`, `n`, and the condition `(cur >> j & 1)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
