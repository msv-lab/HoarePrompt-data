Output State: **`j` is 1, `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1, and `suf[1][1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, this means `suf[1][1]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1, which means `suf[0][1]` was 0 before the increment, and now it is 1. Since `j` is 1, `suf[1][1]` starts at 0 and is incremented to 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
