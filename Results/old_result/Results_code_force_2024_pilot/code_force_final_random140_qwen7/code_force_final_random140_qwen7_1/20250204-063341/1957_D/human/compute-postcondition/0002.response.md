Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `prefix` is a list containing a single integer 0.**

The code initializes the list `prefix` with a single element, which is 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
