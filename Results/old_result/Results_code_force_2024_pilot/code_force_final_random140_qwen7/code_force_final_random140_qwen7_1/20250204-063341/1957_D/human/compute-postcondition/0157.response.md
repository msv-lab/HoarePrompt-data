Output State: **`j` is 31; `c` is `prefix[i]`; `pre[31][1]` remains unchanged; `suf[31][1]` remains unchanged; `pre[j][0]` is 32; `suf[j][0]` is 30; `i` is `n + 1`; `y` is `arr[i - 1]`; `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1; `ans` is increased by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 31 to 30.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
