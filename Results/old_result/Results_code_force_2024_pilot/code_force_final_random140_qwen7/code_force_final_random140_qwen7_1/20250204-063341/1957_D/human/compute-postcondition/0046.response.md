Output State: **`j` is 0; `cur` is an integer; `suf[0][1]` is 1; the value of `(cur >> j & 1)` is true**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0 initially, `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `(cur >> j & 1)` is true, and given `j` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(cur & 1)`, which is true. This means `cur` must be an odd number. All other variables remain unchanged.
