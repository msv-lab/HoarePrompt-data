Output State: **After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31. For each `j` from 0 to 31, if `cur >> j & 1` is true, `suf[j][1]` will be incremented by 1; otherwise, `suf[j][0]` will be incremented by 1.**

This means that `suf[j]` will contain a list where the first element (`suf[j][0]`) represents the count of positions in `cur` where the bit at position `j` is 0, and the second element (`suf[j][1]`) represents the count of positions where the bit at position `j` is 1. Since `cur` is initially the value of `prefix[30]`, and `j` ranges from 0 to 31, the final state of `suf` will reflect the bit counts of `cur` for each bit position.
