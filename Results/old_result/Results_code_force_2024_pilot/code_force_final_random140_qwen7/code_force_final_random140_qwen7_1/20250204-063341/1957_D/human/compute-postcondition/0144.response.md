Postcondition: `j` is 2, `suf[1][1]` and `suf[1][0]` are either decremented by 1 or remain unchanged. If `c >> 2 & 1` is true, then `suf[1][1]` is decremented by 1 and `suf[1][0]` remains unchanged, while `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1. If `c >> 2 & 1` is false, then `suf[1][0]` is decremented by 1 and `suf[1][1]` remains unchanged, and `pre[2][0]` is set to 1.
