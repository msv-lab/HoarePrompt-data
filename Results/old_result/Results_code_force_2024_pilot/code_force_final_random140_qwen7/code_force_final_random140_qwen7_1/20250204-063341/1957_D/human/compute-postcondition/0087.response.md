Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is 1; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates the bit length of `y` using the `bit_length()` method and subtracts 1 from it. Since `y` is initially set to `arr[0]`, and without knowing the exact value of `arr[0]`, we assume it is a non-zero integer (as `bit_length()` is not defined for zero). For any non-zero integer, `bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent the number in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Subtracting 1 from this value gives `k`. If `arr[0]` is 1 (the smallest positive integer), its binary representation is '1', which has a bit length of 1. Thus, `k` would be `1 - 1 = 0`. Therefore, `k` is 0.
