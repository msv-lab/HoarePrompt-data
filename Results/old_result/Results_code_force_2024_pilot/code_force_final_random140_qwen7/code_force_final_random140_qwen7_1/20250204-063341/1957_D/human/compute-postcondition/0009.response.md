Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `v` is the last element of `arr`, and `prefix` is a list where the second element is `v ^ prefix[0]` and now contains `len(arr)` elements, with each element being the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `arr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` and `n` will remain as they were initially. The `arr` list will be the same as it was before the loop started. However, the `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting from the first element up to each subsequent element. The length of the `prefix` list will be equal to the length of `arr`.
