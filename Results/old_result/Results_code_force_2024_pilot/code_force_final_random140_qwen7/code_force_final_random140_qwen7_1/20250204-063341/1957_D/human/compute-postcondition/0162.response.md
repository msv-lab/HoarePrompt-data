Output State: **`j` is 32; `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1**

Explanation: The initial state had `j` set to 32 and `pre[j][1]` increased by 1. The code snippet decreases `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since no other variables are affected, the only change is to `suf[j][1]`. Therefore, `suf[j][1]` is now decreased by 1 from its previous value.
