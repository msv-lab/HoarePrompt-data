Postcondition: `j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `suf[0][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `pre[1][0]` is either 1 or 2, and `suf[1][0]` is 0; `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1 if `c >> j & 1` is true, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.
