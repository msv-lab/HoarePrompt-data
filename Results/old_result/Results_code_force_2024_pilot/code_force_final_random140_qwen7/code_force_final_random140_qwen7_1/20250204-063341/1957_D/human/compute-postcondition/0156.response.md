Output State: **`j` is 31; `c` is `prefix[i]`; `pre[31][1]` remains unchanged; `suf[31][1]` remains unchanged; `pre[j][0]` is 32 (since `pre[j][0]` was 31 and it was incremented by 1); `suf[j][0]` ranges from 0 to 31; `i` is `n + 1`; `y` is `arr[i - 1]`; `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1; `ans` is increased by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0]`**
