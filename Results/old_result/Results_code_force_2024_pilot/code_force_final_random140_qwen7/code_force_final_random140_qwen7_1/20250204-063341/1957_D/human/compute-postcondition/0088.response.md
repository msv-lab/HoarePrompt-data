Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is 1; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 0; `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` to its current value. Since `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
