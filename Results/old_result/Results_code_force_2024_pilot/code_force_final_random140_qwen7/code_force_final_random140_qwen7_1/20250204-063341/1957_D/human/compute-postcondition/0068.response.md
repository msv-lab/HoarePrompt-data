Output State: **`j` is 0; `suf[0][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 0 and `(cur >> j & 1)` is False (which means `suf[0][0]` is initially 0), after executing `suf[j][0] += 1`, `suf[0][0]` becomes 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
