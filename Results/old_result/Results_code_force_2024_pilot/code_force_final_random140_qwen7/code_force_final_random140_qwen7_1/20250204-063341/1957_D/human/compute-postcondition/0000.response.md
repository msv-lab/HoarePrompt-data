Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is still valid. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user, constrained to be between 1 and \(10^5\).
