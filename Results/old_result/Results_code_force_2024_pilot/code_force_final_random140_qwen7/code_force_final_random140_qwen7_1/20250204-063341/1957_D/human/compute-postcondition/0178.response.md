Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns nothing explicitly but processes the data according to the given constraints and relationships.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by a value `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs without returning any explicit value, focusing on the internal logic defined by the constraints and relationships provided.
