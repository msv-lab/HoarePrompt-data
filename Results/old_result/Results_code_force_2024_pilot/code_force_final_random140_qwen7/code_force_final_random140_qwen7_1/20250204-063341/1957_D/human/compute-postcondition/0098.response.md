Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 0, `suf[0][0]` is `-1`**.

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, the value of `suf[0][0]` is decreased by 1. Since `pre[0][0]` is initially 1, `ans` remains unchanged as it does not depend on `suf[0][0]` directly in its current form. All other variables remain unaffected.
