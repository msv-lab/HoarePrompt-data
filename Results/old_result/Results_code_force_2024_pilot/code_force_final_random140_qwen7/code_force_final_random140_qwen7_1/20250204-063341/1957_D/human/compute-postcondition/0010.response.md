Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `v` is the last element of `arr`, and `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `arr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` contains the original list of integers, and `prefix` is a list where each element is the result of XORing all the elements in `arr` up to that point in the list. The final element in `prefix` will be the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`.
