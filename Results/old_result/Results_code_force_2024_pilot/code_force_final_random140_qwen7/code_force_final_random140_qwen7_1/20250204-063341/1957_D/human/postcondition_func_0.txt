The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It constructs a prefix XOR array and then uses this array to compute a value based on bit counts. Finally, it prints the computed value, which turns out to be 0 for all test cases.
