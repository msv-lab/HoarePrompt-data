Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1.**

The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` is not specified, we assume it refers to the current index, which is 0 based on the context. Therefore, `suf[0][1]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
