Output State: **`j` is 2; `suf[1][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged; `suf[1][0]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged; `pre[j][0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `pre[2][0]` is incremented by 1. The states of `j`, `suf[1][1]`, and `suf[1][0]` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
