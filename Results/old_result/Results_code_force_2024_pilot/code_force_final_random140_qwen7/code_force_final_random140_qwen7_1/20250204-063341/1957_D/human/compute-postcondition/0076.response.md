Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `31` (inclusive), meaning `j` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `31`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `32`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as follows:
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `cur` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1 is greater than 0, then `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[1][1]` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is 1 and `suf[1][0]` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2`.
   - The loop will continue if `j < 32`, which is true for `j = 2`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `j` will be updated to `2`.
   - The values of `suf[0][1]`, `suf[1][1]`, `suf[0][0]`, and `suf[1][0]` will remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop body changes them.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2**. The values of `suf[0][1]`, `suf[1][1]`, `suf[0][0]`, and `suf[1][0]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body modifies them.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`j` is 2**.
