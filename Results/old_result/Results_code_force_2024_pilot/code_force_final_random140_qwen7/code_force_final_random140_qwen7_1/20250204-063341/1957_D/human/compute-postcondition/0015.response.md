Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(32)` statement. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `i` is 0 and `pre[0][0]` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 32.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The state of `pre[0][0]` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `pre[0][0]` is 1**
