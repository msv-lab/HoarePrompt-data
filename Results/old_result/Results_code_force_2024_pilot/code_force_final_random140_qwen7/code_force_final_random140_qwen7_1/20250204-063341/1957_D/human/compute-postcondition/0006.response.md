Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element replaced by the second element, `v` is the second element of `arr`, `prefix` is a list where the second element is `v ^ prefix[0]`, and `prefix` has an additional element which is `v ^ prefix[-1]`**.

In more detail:
- `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains unchanged as an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `arr` remains a non-empty list where the first element is replaced by the second element.
- `v` remains the second element of `arr`.
- `prefix` is updated to include an additional element, which is the bitwise XOR of `v` and the last element of `prefix`.
