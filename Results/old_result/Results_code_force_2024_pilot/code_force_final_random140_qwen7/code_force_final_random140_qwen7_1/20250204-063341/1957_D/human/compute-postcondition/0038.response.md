Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` is 32; `suf[0][0]` is 1 or `suf[0][1]` is 2 depending on the condition `(cur >> 1 & 1)`; `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `j` is updated to 2.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged at 32.
- The value of `suf[0][0]` remains unchanged unless the condition `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is True, in which case it is set to 2. Otherwise, it remains 1.
- The value of `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1, regardless of the condition.
