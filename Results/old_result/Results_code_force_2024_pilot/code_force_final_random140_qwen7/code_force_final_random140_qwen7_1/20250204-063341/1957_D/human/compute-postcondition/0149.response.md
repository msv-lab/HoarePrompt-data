Output State: **`j` is 31, `c` is an integer, `pre[31][1]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `suf[31][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `pre[j][0]` ranges from 1 to 32, and `suf[j][0]` ranges from 0 to 31, `i` is `n + 1`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `ans` is increased by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding the product of `pre[k][0]` and `suf[k][0]` plus the product of `pre[k][1]` and `suf[k][1]`. The values of `j`, `c`, `pre[31][1]`, `suf[31][1]`, `pre[j][0]`, `suf[j][0]`, `i`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
