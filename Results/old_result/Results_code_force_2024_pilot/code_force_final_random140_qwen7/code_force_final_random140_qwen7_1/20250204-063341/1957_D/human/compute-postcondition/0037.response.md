Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` is 32; `suf[0][1]` is 2 if `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is True, otherwise `suf[0][0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[0][1]` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, `n` is 32, and `suf[0][1]` is 2 if `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is True, otherwise `suf[0][0]` is 1. After executing the code, `suf[0][1]` will be incremented by 1, making it 2 if `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is True, or 1 if `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is False. The values of `j`, `n`, and the other elements of `suf` remain unchanged except for `suf[0][1]`.
