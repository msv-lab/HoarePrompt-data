Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `v` is the last element of `arr`, and `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `arr`. `pre` is a list of lists where each sublist has two elements both initialized to 0; `suf` is a list of lists where each sublist has two elements both initialized to 0.**

The code initializes a new list `suf` with 32 sublists, and each sublist contains two elements, both set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `v`, `prefix`, and `pre` remain unchanged from their initial state.
