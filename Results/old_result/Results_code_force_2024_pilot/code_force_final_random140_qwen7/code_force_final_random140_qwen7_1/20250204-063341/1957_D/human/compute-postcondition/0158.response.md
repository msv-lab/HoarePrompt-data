Postcondition: `j` is 31, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `pre[31][1]` is incremented by 1 if `c` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise AND with 1 results in 1, otherwise `pre[31][1]` remains unchanged; `suf[31][1]` is decremented by 1 if `c` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise AND with 1 results in 1, otherwise `suf[31][1]` remains unchanged; `pre[j][0]` ranges from 1 to 32; `suf[j][0]` ranges from 0 to 31; `i` is `n + 1`; `y` is `arr[i - 1]`; `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1; `ans` is increased by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` if `c` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise AND with 1 results in 1, otherwise `ans` is increased by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0]`.
