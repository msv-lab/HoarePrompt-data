Output State: **`j` is 2; `suf[1][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged; `suf[1][0]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged; `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 2, the value of `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1. The values of `suf[1][1]` and `suf[1][0]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
