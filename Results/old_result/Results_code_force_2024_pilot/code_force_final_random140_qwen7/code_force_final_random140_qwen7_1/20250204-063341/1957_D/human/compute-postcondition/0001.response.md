Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input using `input()`, splitting the string into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but now `arr` holds the list of integers from the input.
