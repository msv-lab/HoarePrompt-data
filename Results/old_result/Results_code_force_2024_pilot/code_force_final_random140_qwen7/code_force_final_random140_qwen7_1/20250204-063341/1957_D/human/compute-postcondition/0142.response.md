Output State: **`j` is 2; `suf[1][0]` is decremented by 1; `suf[1][1]` remains unchanged; `pre[j][0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, this means `suf[2][0]` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`suf[1][0]`, `suf[1][1]`, and `pre[j][0]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
