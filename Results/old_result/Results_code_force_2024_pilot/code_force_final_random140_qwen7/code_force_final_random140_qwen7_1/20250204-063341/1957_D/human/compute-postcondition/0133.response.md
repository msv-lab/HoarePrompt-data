Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `suf[0][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `pre[1][0]` is 1, and `suf[1][0]` is 0; `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, this means `suf[1][1]` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
