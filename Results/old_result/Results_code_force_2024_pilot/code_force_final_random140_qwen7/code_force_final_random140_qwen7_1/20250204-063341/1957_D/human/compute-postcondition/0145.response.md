Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is 31, `c` is an integer, `pre[31][1]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `suf[31][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `pre[j][0]` ranges from 1 to 32, and `suf[j][0]` ranges from 0 to 31.**

In this final state, after the loop has executed 32 times (from `j = 0` to `j = 31`), the variable `j` will be 31. The variable `c` remains an integer. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the corresponding bit in `c` is set (`c >> j & 1` evaluates to True), `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1. This means that by the end of the loop, `pre[31][1]` will either be incremented by 1 or remain unchanged, and `suf[31][1]` will either be decremented by 1 or remain unchanged. Similarly, `pre[j][0]` for any `j` from 0 to 31 will range from 1 to 32, and `suf[j][0]` will range from 0 to 31 based on the bits set in `c`.
