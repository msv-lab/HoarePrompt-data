Output State: **`j` is 0; `suf[0][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value at `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0 and the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0 (though this bit information is not directly used in the operation), the value of `suf[0][0]` is incremented by 1. Since `suf[0][0]` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
