Output State: **`j` is 0; `c` is an integer where the result of (c >> j & 1) is 0; `pre[j][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0 and the result of `(c >> j & 1)` is 0, `c` is an integer such that when right-shifted by 0 and then bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0. This means `c` is even. Since `pre[j][0]` was initially 0 (as `j` is 0), it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
