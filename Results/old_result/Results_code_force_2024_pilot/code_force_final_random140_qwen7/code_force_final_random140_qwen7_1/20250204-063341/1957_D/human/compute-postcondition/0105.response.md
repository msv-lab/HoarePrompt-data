Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 3, `suf[3][0]` is `suf[3][0] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, the value of `suf[3][0]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
