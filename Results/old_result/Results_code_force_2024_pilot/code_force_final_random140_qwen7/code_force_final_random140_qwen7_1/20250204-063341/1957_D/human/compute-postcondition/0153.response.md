Output State: **`j` is 31; `c` is `prefix[i]`; `pre[31][1]` is incremented by 1; `suf[31][1]` remains unchanged; `pre[j][0]` ranges from 1 to 32; `suf[j][0]` ranges from 0 to 31; `i` is `n + 1`; `y` is `arr[i - 1]`; `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1; `ans` is increased by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`; and the value of `c` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise AND with 1 results in 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `pre[j][1]` by 1, where `j` is 31. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
