Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element replaced by the second element, `v` is the next element in `arr`, and `prefix` is a list where the second element is `v ^ prefix[0]` and now has an additional element which is `v ^ prefix[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])` appends a new element to the `prefix` list. This new element is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list (`prefix[-1]`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
