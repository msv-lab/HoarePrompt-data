State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer, `L1` is an empty list, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. The loop condition `i < num` must be true for the loop to execute.
3. Therefore, `num` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.
4. The initial values of `t`, `x`, `L1`, and `res` do not affect the loop's ability to start, so they remain as given.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` starts at 0 and `num` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
