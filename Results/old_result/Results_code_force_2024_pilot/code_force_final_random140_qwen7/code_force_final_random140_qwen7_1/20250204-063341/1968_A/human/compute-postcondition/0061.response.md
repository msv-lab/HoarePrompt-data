Output State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, `j` is `L1[i] + 2`, and `res` contains two additional elements which are `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Since `L1[i]` is already known to be greater than or equal to 1 and divisible by `j`, and `j` is `L1[i] + 2`, the new value added to `res` is calculated as `L1[i] // (L1[i] + 2) * (L1[i] + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
