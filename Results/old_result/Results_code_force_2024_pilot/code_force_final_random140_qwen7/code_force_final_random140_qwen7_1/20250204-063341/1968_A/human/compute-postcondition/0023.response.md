Output State: **`res` now contains the new element `L1[i] // (j + 1) * ((j + 1) - 1)` and the element `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` retains its previous value, `j` is incremented by 1, and `L1[i]` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `res`. The new element is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Before appending, `res` already contained the element `L1[i] // (j + 1) * ((j + 1) - 1)`. The variable `i` retains its previous value, `j` is incremented by 1, and `L1[i]` remains unchanged.
