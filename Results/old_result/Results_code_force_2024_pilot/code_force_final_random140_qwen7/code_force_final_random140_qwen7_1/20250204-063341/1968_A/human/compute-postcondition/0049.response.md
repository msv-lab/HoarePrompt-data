Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `L1[i]`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 2` to `j <= L1[i] + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `num`.
- `L1[i]` is `L1[num]`.
- `res` will be recalculated based on `L1[num]`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition, which are `j` and `L1[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `j`**: The variable `j` starts at 2 and increments until it reaches `L1[i] + 1`. Therefore, `j` must be able to start at 2 and increment up to `L1[i] + 1`.
2. **Variable `L1[i]`**: This variable determines the upper bound of the loop. For the loop to execute, `L1[i]` must be at least 1 (since `j` starts at 2 and goes up to `L1[i] + 1`, `L1[i]` must be non-negative).

### Adjusting the State:

- We need to ensure that `L1[i]` is at least 1, because if `L1[i]` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.
- The value of `i` (which is `num`) does not directly affect the loop execution but is used to determine `L1[i]`.

### Final State:

- `i` is `num` (this does not need adjustment as it is part of the initialization).
- `L1[i]` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` will start at 2 and increment accordingly, but its starting point and range depend on `L1[i]`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
