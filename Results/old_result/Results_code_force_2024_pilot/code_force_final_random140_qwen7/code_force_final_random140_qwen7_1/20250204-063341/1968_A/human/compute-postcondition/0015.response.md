Output State: **`res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[num]` is a positive integer such that `L1[num] + 1 >= 2`, and the current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. The values of `t`, `x`, `num`, `i`, and `L1[num]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `j` is used in the calculation but does not change. Therefore, the only updated variable is `res`, which now includes the calculated value.
