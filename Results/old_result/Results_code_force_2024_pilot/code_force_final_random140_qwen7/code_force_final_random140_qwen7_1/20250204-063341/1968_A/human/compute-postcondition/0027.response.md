Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[num]` is a positive integer, and `res` is a list containing multiple elements. Each element in `res` is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for each `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i] + 1` where `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. After the loop completes, `res` will contain all such calculated values for each `j` that satisfies the condition for every `i` in the loop. The values of `t`, `x`, `num`, `i`, and `L1[num]` remain unchanged, but `res` is updated with all valid results from the loop iterations.

In simpler terms, after running the loop through all its iterations, `res` will contain a list of numbers generated by the formula `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for each `j` from 2 to `L1[i] + 1` where `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. The values of `t`, `x`, `num`, and `i` stay the same, while `res` gets updated with all the computed values.
