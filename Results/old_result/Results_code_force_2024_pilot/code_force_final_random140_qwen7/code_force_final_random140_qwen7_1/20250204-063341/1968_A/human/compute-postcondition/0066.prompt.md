Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `num`, and `num` must be greater than 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each of which is an integer input by the user. The variable `i` will be equal to `num` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `num`. The variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop. The list `res` remains empty since no operations were performed on it within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(num):
    for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
        if L1[i] % j == 0:
            res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[num]` is a positive integer, and `res` contains multiple elements. Specifically, `res` will contain the results of the operations performed within the loop for each iteration. The loop iterates from `j = 2` up to `L1[i] + 1`, and for each `j` where `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, it appends the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to `res` and breaks out of the loop. Since the loop continues until `j` reaches `L1[i] + 1`, `res` will include all such values for each `j` that divides `L1[i]` without a remainder.

The final state of `res` will be a list containing all the computed values for each valid `j` from the first iteration to the last, where `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. The values of `t`, `x`, `num`, `i`, and `L1[num]` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` remains as `num - 1`, `L1[i]` is a positive integer, and `res` contains multiple elements which are the results of the operation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for each `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i] + 1` where `L1[i] % j == 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `i` is still `num`, `L1[i]` is reduced to its smallest prime factor (or remains as 1 if it was 1 initially), and `res` contains all values calculated from `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for each valid `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i]` until the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` is met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
