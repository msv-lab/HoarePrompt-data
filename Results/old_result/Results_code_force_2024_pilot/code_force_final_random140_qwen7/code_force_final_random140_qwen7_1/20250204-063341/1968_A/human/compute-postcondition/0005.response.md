Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `num`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\)
   - `num` is an input integer
   - `L1` is a list containing one element which is an integer entered by the user
   - `res` is an empty list
   - `i` is 1
   - `num` must be greater than 0

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < num`.

4. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `num` must remain the same since it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `num` remains unchanged.
   - `L1` remains unchanged.
   - `res` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `num` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing one element which is an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `num` must be greater than 0**
