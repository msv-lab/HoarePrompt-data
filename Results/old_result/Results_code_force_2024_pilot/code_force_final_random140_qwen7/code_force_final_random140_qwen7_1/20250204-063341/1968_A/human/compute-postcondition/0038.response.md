Output State: **`i` is `num - 1`; `res` contains the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `j` is `current_j + 1`**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Here, `i` is `num - 1`, and `j` is `current_j + 1`.
- The value of `i` remains `num - 1` because the code does not change its value.
- The value of `res` is updated by appending the calculated value to it.
- The value of `j` is updated to `current_j + 1`, but since `current_j` is not explicitly defined, we refer to it as `j` being `current_j + 1`.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `i`, the updated `res` list with the new value, and the updated `j` which is `current_j + 1`.
