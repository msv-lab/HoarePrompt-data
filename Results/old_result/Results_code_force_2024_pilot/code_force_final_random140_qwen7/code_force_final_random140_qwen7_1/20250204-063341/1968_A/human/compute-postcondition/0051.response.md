Output State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, `res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Since `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` is calculated and added to `res`. The values of `i`, `L1[i]`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the updated state of `res` is included in the output state.
