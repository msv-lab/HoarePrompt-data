Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[num]` is a positive integer, and `res` contains multiple elements. Specifically, `res` will contain the results of the operations performed within the loop for each iteration. The loop iterates from `j = 2` up to `L1[i] + 1`, and for each `j` where `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, it appends the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to `res` and breaks out of the loop. Since the loop continues until `j` reaches `L1[i] + 1`, `res` will include all such values for each `j` that divides `L1[i]` without a remainder.

The final state of `res` will be a list containing all the computed values for each valid `j` from the first iteration to the last, where `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. The values of `t`, `x`, `num`, `i`, and `L1[num]` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states after the loop completes.
