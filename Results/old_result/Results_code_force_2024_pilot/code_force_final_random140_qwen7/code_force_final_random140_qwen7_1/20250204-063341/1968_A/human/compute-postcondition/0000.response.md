Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads an input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The initial conditions for `t` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` is still an integer within the range 2 to 1000. The variable `num` now holds the value of the input provided by the user.
