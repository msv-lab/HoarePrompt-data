Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `2` to `L1[i]`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i]`.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is `num - 1`.
   - `L1[i]` is a positive integer.
   - `res` contains one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and `L1[i] % j` equals 0.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, it seems that for each value of `j` within the specified range, some operation is performed on `L1[i]` and the result is added to `res` if certain conditions are met.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is already determined (`i = num - 1`), it does not change within the loop.
   - `L1[i]` remains the same unless the loop body modifies it, but since no modification is mentioned, `L1[i]` stays the same.
   - `res` will contain the result of the operation for the current value of `j` if the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` is met. However, the exact value of `res` is not specified in the postcondition for the next iteration, so we cannot assume any specific value for `res` other than it being updated according to the loop body.

6. **Update the loop variable `j`**: For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` remains `num - 1`.
- `L1[i]` remains the same.
- `res` will be updated according to the loop body, but we cannot specify its exact value without the loop body details.
- `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `num - 1`, `L1[i]` is a positive integer, `res` will be updated according to the loop body, and `j` is `current_j + 1` where `current_j` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.**
