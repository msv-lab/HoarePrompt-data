Output State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, `j` is `L1[i] + 1`, `res` contains one additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`**.

This means that the list `res` has been appended with a new element calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The values of `i`, `L1[i]`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states, with the only new information being the addition to the `res` list.
