Output State: **`i` is `num - 1`, `res` contains one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `L1[i] % j` equals 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `i`, `res`, `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and `L1[i] % j`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged, and the only effect is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
