Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and it ranges from `2` to `L1[i] + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `num`.
   - `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`.
   - `j` is `L1[i] + 1`.
   - `res` contains one additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `2` to `L1[i] + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `L1[i] + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `L1[i] + 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i] + 1`.
   - Since `j` is now `L1[i] + 2`, the loop will stop executing.

6. **Update the states**:
   - `i` remains `num`.
   - `L1[i]` remains the same.
   - `j` becomes `L1[i] + 2`.
   - `res` remains unchanged because the loop has stopped.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the end of the loop in this case) is:

**State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, `j` is `L1[i] + 2`, and `res` contains one additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`**.
