Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` remains as `num - 1`, `L1[i]` is a positive integer, and `res` contains multiple elements which are the results of the operation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for each `j` in the range from 2 to `L1[i] + 1` where `L1[i] % j == 0`.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will still be `num - 1` because the loop does not change the value of `i`. The list `L1` remains unchanged since the loop only accesses `L1[i]` and does not modify it. The variable `res` will contain a series of values resulting from the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for each divisor `j` of `L1[i]` within the specified range. Each time the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` is met, the corresponding value is appended to `res`. The loop iterates over all integers from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`, checking divisibility and appending the result to `res` whenever the condition is satisfied.
