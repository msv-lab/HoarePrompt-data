Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `j`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `num`.
   - `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`.
   - In this case, `res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
   - If `L1[i]` is not divisible by `j`, no change occurs to `res`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is the only variable changing within the loop, we need to determine its new value.
   - The loop starts with `j = 2` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration until `j` reaches `L1[i] + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was one less than its current limit, which is `L1[i] + 1`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` remains `num` because it is not modified in the loop.
- `L1[i]` remains the same because it is not modified in the loop.
- `j` increases by 1 from its previous value, so if it was `L1[i]`, it now becomes `L1[i] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, `j` is `L1[i] + 1`**
