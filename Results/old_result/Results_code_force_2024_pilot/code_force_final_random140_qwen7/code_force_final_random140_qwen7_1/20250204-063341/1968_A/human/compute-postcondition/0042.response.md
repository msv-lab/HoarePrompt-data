Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is `num - 1`.
   - `res` is updated to `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i] % j == 0`, otherwise it retains its previous value.
   - `j` is `current_j + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `2` to `L1[i] + 1`.

4. **Determine the next state of `j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `current_j + 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `2` to `L1[i] + 1`. Therefore, the next value of `j` should still be within this range.

6. **Adjust the states**: We need to update the state of `j` to `current_j + 2`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**State: **`i` is `num - 1`, `res` retains its previous value, `j` is `current_j + 2`**.
