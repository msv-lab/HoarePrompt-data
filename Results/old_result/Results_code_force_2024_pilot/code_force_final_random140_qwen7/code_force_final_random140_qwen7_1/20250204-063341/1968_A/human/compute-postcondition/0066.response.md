Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` contains exactly `num` elements, each of which is an integer input by the user, and `res` is a list containing the results of the operations performed within the loop for each iteration.**

After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following will be true:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the loop.
- The variable `x` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the loop.
- The variable `num` remains unchanged, as it was set as the initial length of `L1` and `i` is reset to `num` at the end of the loop.
- The variable `i` is reset to `num` at the end of the loop.
- The list `L1` remains unchanged, as it was not modified within the loop.
- The list `res` contains the results of the operations performed within the loop for each element of `L1`. For each element `L1[i]`, the loop iterates from `j = 2` up to `L1[i] + 1`, and for each `j` where `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, it appends the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to `res` and breaks out of the inner loop. This process is repeated for each element in `L1`.
