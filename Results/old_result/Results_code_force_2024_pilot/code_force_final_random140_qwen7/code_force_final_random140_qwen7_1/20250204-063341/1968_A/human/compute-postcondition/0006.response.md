Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing two elements (the first element is an integer entered by the user, the second element is an integer entered by the user), `res` is an empty list, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code appends an integer entered by the user to the list `L1`. Since `i` was initially 2, after appending the integer, `i` is incremented to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
