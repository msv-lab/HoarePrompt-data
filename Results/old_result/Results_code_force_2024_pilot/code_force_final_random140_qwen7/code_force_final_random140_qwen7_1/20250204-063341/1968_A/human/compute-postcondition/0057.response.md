Output State: **`i` is `num`, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is divisible by `j`, `j` is `L1[i] + 1`, `res` contains one additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned, the `break` statement implies that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional structure. The values of `i`, `L1[i]`, `j`, and `res` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
