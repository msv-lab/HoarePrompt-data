Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), `num` is an input integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each being an integer entered by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `num`, and `num` must be greater than 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each representing an integer input by the user during the respective iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `num` because it increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `num`. The variables `t`, `x`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
