Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `t` (the number of test cases), `t` (num_test_cases) is exactly `t`, and it is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the integers obtained from the last input before the loop ended. The output of the loop for each test case is calculated as `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from their final values during the last iteration of the loop.
