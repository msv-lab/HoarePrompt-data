Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `i` and the value generated by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers obtained from input

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each integer value generated by `int(input())`. This means that `i` will increment by 1 for each iteration, and the loop will continue as long as the input value is within the specified range.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, after the next iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - The input value for the next iteration will be read using `int(input())`. Let's denote this new input value as `new_t`.
   - For the loop to continue, `new_t` must still be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but now it is the new input value `new_t`
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` remain the same as they were obtained from input at the beginning of the program

Given that the exact value of `new_t` is not known, we can represent it symbolically. However, we know it must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers obtained from input**
