Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2.
- `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 1 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers entered by the user.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:
```python
a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)
```

Let's break it down:

1. **Floor Division (`//`)**:
   - `a // 2`: This divides `a` by 2 and takes the floor value.
   - `b // 2`: This divides `b` by 2 and takes the floor value.
   - `c // 2`: This divides `c` by 2 and takes the floor value.
   - `d // 2`: This divides `d` by 2 and takes the floor value.

2. **Modulo Operation (`%`)**:
   - `a % 2`: This gives the remainder when `a` is divided by 2.
   - `b % 2`: This gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 2.
   - `c % 3`: This gives the remainder when `c` is divided by 3.

3. **Boolean Expression**:
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3`: This checks if the sum of the remainders is equal to 3.
   - `int(...)`: Converts the boolean result to an integer (1 if true, 0 if false).

Since `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are user-entered integers, their exact values are unknown. However, we can analyze the expression in general terms.

### Analysis:
- The floor division operations (`a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, `d // 2`) will give integer results.
- The modulo operations (`a % 2`, `b % 2`, `c % 3`) will give values between 0 and 1 for `a % 2` and `b % 2`, and between 0 and 2 for `c % 3`.

For the boolean expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` to be true:
- `a % 2` must be 1 (since `a % 2` can only be 0 or 1).
- `b % 2` must be 1 (since `b % 2` can only be 0 or 1).
- `c % 3` must be 1 (since `c % 3` can only be 0 or 1, and the only way to get a sum of 3 from three numbers each between 0 and 2 is if they are 1, 1, and 1).

If these conditions are met, the expression evaluates to 1, otherwise, it evaluates to 0.

### Conclusion:
The expression will evaluate to the sum of the floor divisions plus either 1 or 0 depending on the modulo conditions.

Output: **(a // 2) + (b // 2) + (c // 2) + (d // 2) + (1 if (a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3) else 0)**
