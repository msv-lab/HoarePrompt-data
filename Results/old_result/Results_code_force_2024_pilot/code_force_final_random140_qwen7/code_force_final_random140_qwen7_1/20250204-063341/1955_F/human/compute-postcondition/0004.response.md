Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The variable `i` retains its initial value of 1, and the condition for `t` remains unchanged.
