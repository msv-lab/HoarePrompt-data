Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each represented by four non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which denote the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts using the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value.**
