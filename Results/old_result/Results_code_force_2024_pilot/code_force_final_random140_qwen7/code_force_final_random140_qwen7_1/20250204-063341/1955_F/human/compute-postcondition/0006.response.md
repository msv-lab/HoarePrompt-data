Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
   - `a` is the first integer input
   - `b` is the second integer input
   - `c` is the third integer input
   - `d` is the fourth integer input

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

5. **Determine the new value of `int(input())`**: This value is determined by the user input during the current iteration. Since we don't know the exact input yet, let's denote it as `new_t`. For the loop to execute again, `new_t` must be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 2).

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state such that the loop can potentially execute again. The only variable that changes in the loop head is `int(input())`, and it must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state should reflect that `i` is now 2 and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `t` (num_test_cases) must be greater than 1 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input**
