Output State: The value of `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases (`t`), `t` must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After all iterations, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will hold the last set of integers entered by the user for the final test case.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will reflect the total count of test cases processed, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will correspond to the inputs provided for the last test case, as the loop processes each test case one by one.
