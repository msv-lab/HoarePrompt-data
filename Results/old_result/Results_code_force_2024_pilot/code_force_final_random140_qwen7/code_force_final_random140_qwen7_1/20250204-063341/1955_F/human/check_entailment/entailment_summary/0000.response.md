Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided formula correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the initial counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.

### Analysis:
1. **Formula Breakdown**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This part of the formula calculates the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed, ensuring the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero. Since 2s, 3s, and 4s do not affect the parity (odd/even count) of the sequence, they contribute nothing to this part.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`: This part checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by their respective values equals 3. If so, it means there are enough odd numbers to ensure the XOR of the remaining sequence is non-zero, allowing Alice to win. Otherwise, Bob wins.

2. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Alice Wins Condition**: The XOR of the sequence is non-zero if there is an odd number of 1s, 3s, or a combination of 1s and 3s that ensures the XOR is non-zero after removing some numbers.
   - **Bob Wins Condition**: The XOR of the sequence is zero if the number of 1s, 3s, and the combination of 1s and 3s does not allow for a non-zero XOR after removing some numbers.

Given the problem statement and the formula used, the logic appears to correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring the sequence remains such that Alice cannot force a non-zero XOR.

### Conclusion:
The provided formula and logic match the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
