Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of an even number of the same number (e.g., 0, 0, 0, 0) is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of the same number (e.g., 1, 1, 1) is that number itself.

2. **Strategy for Bob's Wins**:
   - Bob wins if the final XOR of the sequence is 0.
   - To achieve this, Eve should remove numbers such that the remaining sequence's XOR is 0.

3. **Counting Strategy**:
   - If there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, or 3s, they contribute to making the final XOR non-zero.
   - Removing these numbers strategically can help ensure the final XOR is 0.

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed without changing the parity of the count of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
   - The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of 1s, 2s, and 3s is exactly 3, which indicates that the final XOR could be 0.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic of counting pairs and checking the remainder conditions is correct for determining the maximum number of Bob's wins.
- However, the formula used might not fully capture the optimal strategy for removing numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

### Example Verification:
- For the input `(1, 1, 1, 0)`, the output is `1`. This is correct because Bob can win by removing one 1, making the sequence `[1, 0, 0]` with XOR `1`.
- For the input `(1, 0, 1, 2)`, the output is `1`. This is correct because Bob can win by removing one 1 and one 3, making the sequence `[0, 2, 2]` with XOR `0`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
