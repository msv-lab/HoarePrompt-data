Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` respectively).

2. **XOR Calculation**: The key logic of the program is to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win. According to the problem, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The formula used in the program is:
   ```python
   a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)
   ```
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This part calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed, which is the floor division of each count by 2. Each pair ensures that the XOR of the two numbers in the pair is zero.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`: This part checks if there is a combination of the remaining counts (1, 2, 3) that can ensure the XOR remains zero. Specifically, it checks if the sum of the modulo 2 of 1s and 2s plus the modulo 3 of 3s equals 3, which would mean there is a way to pair them up to make the XOR zero.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case as required.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
