Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program calculates the sum of half the counts of all numbers (divided by 2) and adds 1 if the sum of the remainders (after division by 2) equals 3. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for Bob to maximize his wins based on the bitwise XOR condition.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the counts of the numbers and how removing certain numbers affects the overall bitwise XOR result. Specifically, you should focus on maintaining the count of numbers that contribute to making the XOR result zero.
