Output State: **`highestIndex` is 1, `loop_counter` must be less than 100, `length` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `highestNumber` is equal to `inputarray[elementIndex]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to the variable `highestNumber`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
