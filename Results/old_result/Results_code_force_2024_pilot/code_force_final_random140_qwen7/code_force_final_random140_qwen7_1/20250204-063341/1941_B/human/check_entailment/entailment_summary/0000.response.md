Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and decrementing the elements at positions \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly performs the operation described in the problem statement. It modifies the array in place but also returns the modified array. However, since the original array is not directly modified outside this function, we can consider the return value for analysis.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly checks if all elements in the array are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function attempts to solve the problem by repeatedly applying the operation described. It uses a loop to find the highest non-zero element between the second and second-to-last elements, applies the operation, and checks if the resulting array is all zeros. If it finds a way to make the array all zeros within 100 iterations, it returns 'YES'. If not, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The core logic in `func_3` is sound. It correctly identifies the highest non-zero element in the middle of the array and applies the operation to reduce the array towards all zeros.
   - The loop in `func_3` ensures that the operation is applied up to 100 times, which is a reasonable upper limit to prevent infinite loops.
   - The function `func_2` is correctly implemented to check if the array is all zeros.
   - The overall structure of the code matches the problem requirements and the execution summaries provided.

Given the above analysis, the implementation appears to correctly address the problem statement and the provided execution summaries.

Correctness: **True**
