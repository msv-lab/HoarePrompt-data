Postcondition: `loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is 1, and `highestIndex` is either 1 (if `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`) or `highestIndex` remains unchanged (if `inputarray[elementIndex]` is less than `highestNumber`).
