Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 1, and `length` is greater than 1.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `elementIndex` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `elementIndex` would be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `elementIndex` must still be less than `length - 1`. Given that `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` being 2 is valid as long as `length` is at least 3.

4. **Consider the postcondition**:
   - The postcondition states that `highestIndex` is either 1 (if `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`) or remains unchanged (if `inputarray[elementIndex]` is less than `highestNumber`).
   - Since the exact value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is not specified, we cannot determine if `highestIndex` changes. Therefore, we assume it remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `elementIndex` should be 2.
- `length` must remain greater than 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is 2, and `highestIndex` remains unchanged**.
