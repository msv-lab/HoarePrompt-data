Output State: **`loop_counter` must be less than 100; `length` is the length of the input array provided by input(); `highestNumber` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `highestNumber` to -1. This does not affect the values of `loop_counter` or `length`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
