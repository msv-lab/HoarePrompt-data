Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the current `highestNumber` and `inputarray[elementIndex]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `answers` is ['YES']**.

Explanation: The line `answers.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `answers`. Since `answers` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `answers` contains only one element, which is `'YES'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
