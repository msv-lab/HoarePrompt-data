Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains three variables: `elementIndex`, `1`, and `length - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `elementIndex` is initialized to 1.
   - `length - 1` is a constant expression based on the value of `length`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.

4. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `loop_counter` must be less than 100 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head).
   - `length` is the length of the input array provided by input().
   - `highestIndex` is -1 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `elementIndex` must be initialized to 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`. Therefore, `elementIndex` must be less than `length - 1` initially.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `elementIndex` should be set to 1.
- `length` must be such that `1 < length - 1`, which simplifies to `length > 2`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**`loop_counter` must be less than 100, `elementIndex` is 1, `length` must be greater than 2, `highestIndex` is -1**.
