The loop condition is `loop_counter != 100`. For the loop to execute one more time, `loop_counter` must be less than 100 at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `loop_counter` is less than 100 and equals `loop_counter` + 1.
- This means `loop_counter` is currently 99 (since it was less than 100 and then incremented).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `loop_counter` needs to be set to a value that is still less than 100 but will increment to 100 during the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `loop_counter` is set to 99.

State: **`loop_counter` is 99, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array within this range, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**
