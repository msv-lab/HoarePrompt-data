Output State: `loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, and `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`. The variable `highestNumber` holds the highest value found during these iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `highestIndex` will be the index of the highest value in the sub-array `inputarray[1:length-1]`, and `highestNumber` will be the highest value itself. The loop counter `loop_counter` will still be less than 100, as no condition in the loop increments it, and the length of the array and the initial state of `elementIndex` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
