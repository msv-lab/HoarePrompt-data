Output State: **`loop_counter` is 99, `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array within this range, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `length` to be the length of the list `inputarray`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
