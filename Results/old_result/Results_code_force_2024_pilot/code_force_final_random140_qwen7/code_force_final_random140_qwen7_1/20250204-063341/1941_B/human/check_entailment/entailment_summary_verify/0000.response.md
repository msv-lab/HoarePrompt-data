### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summaries step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs the specified operation on the array at a given index `i`.
   - It decreases `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - This function is correctly implemented and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
   - This function is also correctly implemented.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
   - It first checks if the array is already zero using `func_2`.
   - If not, it enters a loop where it finds the highest non-zero value in the array (excluding the first and last elements).
   - It then applies the operation defined in `func_1` to this highest value.
   - It repeats this process up to 100 times.
   - If at any point, the array becomes all zeros, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns.
   - If the loop completes without making the array all zeros, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns.

The key points to consider are:
- The function `func_3` correctly identifies the highest non-zero value and applies the operation to reduce it.
- The operation ensures that the total sum of the array decreases by 3 each time it is applied.
- The loop continues until either the array is all zeros or the maximum number of iterations (100) is reached.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the operations, the function `func_3` should be able to reduce the array to all zeros if it is possible according to the problem statement. The provided counterexample `[2, 2, 2]` is not a valid scenario because it does not violate the operation rules properly. After applying the operation once, the array becomes `[1, 0, 1]`, and subsequent operations can continue to reduce the array further.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate. The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The function `func_3` handles all valid cases correctly and does not miss any scenarios as per the problem description.

**Final: True**
