Output State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100 and equals `loop_counter` + 1, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array within this range, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**

Explanation: The `loop_counter` is incremented by 1, making it one more than its previous value while still being less than 100. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
