The loop condition is `while loop_counter != 100:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `loop_counter` is not equal to 100. At the end of the previous iteration, `loop_counter` has been increased by 1.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `loop_counter` needs to be adjusted such that it is still not equal to 100. Since `loop_counter` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it should now be set to a value that is less than 100.

Given that `loop_counter` was incremented by 1, the new value of `loop_counter` should be less than 100 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to set `loop_counter` to a value that is less than 100.

State: **`elementIndex` is `length`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the current `highestNumber` and `inputarray[elementIndex]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is less than 100**
