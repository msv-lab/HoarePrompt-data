You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    #
    #Explanation: Given the conditions provided, the loop will continue to iterate through each element in `arrayForSuccess` as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Since the loop executed up to the third iteration, it means that the first two elements were equal to 0 (otherwise, the function would have returned False earlier). However, the third element was not equal to 0, which caused the function to return False immediately. Therefore, the final state of the function is that it has returned False due to finding a non-zero element in the list.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `loop_counter` reaches 100), the loop condition (`loop_counter != 100`) becomes false, terminating the loop. At this point, `loop_counter` will be 100. The loop processes each possible `elementIndex` from 1 to `length - 2` during its iterations, ensuring that `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` are updated appropriately. The final state of `elementIndex` will be `length - 1`, as it checks up to the second last element in the array. The value of `highestNumber` will be the maximum value found in the array from index 1 to `length - 1`, and `highestIndex` will be the index of this maximum value. `newArray` will be the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` after the last iteration, and `func_2(newArray)` has been evaluated but did not return 'YES', otherwise the loop would have terminated earlier.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs the operation described in the problem statement.
   - It takes an array and an index `i`, and modifies the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
   - The function returns the modified array.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the input array zero by repeatedly applying the operation described in `func_1`.
   - If the initial array already satisfies the condition (all elements are zero), it immediately returns 'YES'.
   - If the array does not satisfy the condition initially, it enters a loop where it finds the highest non-zero element, applies the operation, and checks again.
   - The loop runs up to 100 iterations to avoid infinite loops.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The function should correctly identify if the array is already all zeros.

2. **Operation Application**:
   - The function should correctly apply the operation and update the array.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The function should terminate correctly when it either makes all elements zero or determines that it cannot do so within 100 iterations.

### Testing the Functionality

Given the problem constraints and the logic in `func_3`, we need to ensure that:
- The function correctly identifies arrays that can be made zero.
- The function correctly handles arrays that cannot be made zero.
- The function does not enter an infinite loop.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - `func_2` correctly checks if all elements are zero.
   - If the array is already all zeros, `func_3` returns 'YES' immediately, which is correct.

2. **Operation Application**:
   - `func_1` correctly applies the operation as specified.
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to modify the array and checks the result.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - `func_3` uses a loop counter to prevent infinite loops.
   - If the loop runs 100 times without making all elements zero, it correctly returns 'NO'.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It checks the initial condition, applies the operation, and handles the termination condition appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
