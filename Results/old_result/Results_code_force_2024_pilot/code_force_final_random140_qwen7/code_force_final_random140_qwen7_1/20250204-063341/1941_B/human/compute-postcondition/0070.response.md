Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the current `highestNumber` and `inputarray[elementIndex]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments. The function call returns a new array, which is stored in the variable `newArray`. The values of `elementIndex`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` remain unchanged from their initial states.
