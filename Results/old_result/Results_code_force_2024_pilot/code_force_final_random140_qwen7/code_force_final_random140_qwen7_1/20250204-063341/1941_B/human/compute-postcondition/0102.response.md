Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, and `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

Explanation: The code creates a new array `newArray` by calling the function `func_1` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments. The values of `elementIndex`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new array `newArray` is the result of the function call, but since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact contents. However, we know that `newArray` exists and is the output of the function call.
