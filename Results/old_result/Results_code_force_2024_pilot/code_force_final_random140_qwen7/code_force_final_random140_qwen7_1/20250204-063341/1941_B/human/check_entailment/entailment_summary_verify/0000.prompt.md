You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2
    array[index + 1] = array[index + 1] - 1
    return array

#Function 2:
def func_2(arrayForSuccess):
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 3:
def func_3(inputarray):

        answers.append('YES')
        return
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        highestNumber = -1
        highestIndex = -1
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        loop_counter += 1
    answers.append('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `inputarray` with at least 3 elements, where each element is in the range [0, 10^9]. It first checks if `func_2(inputarray)` returns `True`. If so, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If not, it iterates up to 100 times, finding the highest number in the array excluding the first and last elements, creating a new array based on this highest number, and checking if `func_2(newArray)` returns `True`. If `func_2(newArray)` returns `True` at any point, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If the loop completes without finding such a case, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. The function can return 'YES', 'NO', or `None` based on the conditions met during its execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_3` does not guarantee that all elements can be reduced to zero. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the array `[2, 2, 2]`. According to the problem description, we can apply the operation to reduce the middle element by 2, but this operation also reduces the adjacent elements by 1. This means that after applying the operation once, the array becomes `[1, 0, 1]`. From this point, no further operations can reduce the array to all zeros because the middle element is zero, and the adjacent elements cannot be reduced without violating the operation rules.

The current implementation of `func_3` does not account for such scenarios, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
