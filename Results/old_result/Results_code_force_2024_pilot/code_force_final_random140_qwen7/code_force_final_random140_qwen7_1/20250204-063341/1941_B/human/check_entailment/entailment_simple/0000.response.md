### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and decrementing \(a_{i-1}\) by 1, \(a_i\) by 2, and \(a_{i+1}\) by 1.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The operation always decreases the sum of the array by 3.
   - To make all elements zero, the initial sum of the array must be divisible by 3.
   - If the sum is not divisible by 3, it's impossible to make all elements zero because each operation reduces the sum by 3.

3. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly performs the specified operation.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It returns `False` if any element is non-zero and `True` otherwise.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the operation. It uses a loop to find the highest value in the array and applies the operation to it. If after 100 iterations, the array still contains non-zero elements, it concludes that it's not possible to make all elements zero.

4. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The code does not handle the case where the sum of the array is not divisible by 3. This is a critical check that should be performed before attempting to use the operations.
   - The function `func_3` should first check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3. If not, it should immediately return 'NO'.
   - The loop in `func_3` is unnecessary if the sum is already checked. The loop could be removed if the sum check is done first.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code provided does not include the necessary sum check. Without this check, the code may incorrectly return 'YES' for some inputs where the sum is not divisible by 3.
   - The loop in `func_3` is designed to handle the case where the sum is divisible by 3, but it is not the most efficient way to solve the problem. A simpler approach would be to directly check the sum before proceeding with the operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is **incorrect** because it does not perform the necessary check to ensure the sum of the array is divisible by 3. This check is crucial to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero.

**Correctness: **False**
