Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is increased by 1.**

The code `loop_counter += 1` increments the value of `loop_counter` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
