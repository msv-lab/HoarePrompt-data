Postcondition: `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `length` must be greater than 2, and if `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` remains unchanged. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is less than `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` remains unchanged as well.
