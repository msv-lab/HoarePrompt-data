Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the current `highestNumber` and `inputarray[elementIndex]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is increased by 1.**

The code `loop_counter += 1` increments the value of `loop_counter` by 1. Since the initial state of `loop_counter` is not specified, we only know that it has been incremented. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations affecting them are performed in the given code snippet.
