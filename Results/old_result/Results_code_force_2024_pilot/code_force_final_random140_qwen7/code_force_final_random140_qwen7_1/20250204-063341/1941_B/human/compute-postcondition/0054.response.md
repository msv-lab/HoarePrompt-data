Postcondition: `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `length` must be greater than 2, and if `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` remains unchanged. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is less than `highestNumber`, then the postcondition does not provide specific information about the values of `highestNumber`, but maintains the condition that `highestNumber` has not been updated by this if-else block.
