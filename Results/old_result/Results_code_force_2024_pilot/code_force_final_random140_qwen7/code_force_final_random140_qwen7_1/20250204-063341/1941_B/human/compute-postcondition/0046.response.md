Output State: **`loop_counter` is 99, `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**

Explanation: The line `highestNumber = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `highestNumber`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
