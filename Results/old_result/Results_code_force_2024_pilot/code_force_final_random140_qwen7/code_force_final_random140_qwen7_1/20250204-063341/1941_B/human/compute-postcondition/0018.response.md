Output State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` is 2**

Explanation: The code sets `highestIndex` to the value of `elementIndex`, which was initially 2. All other variables (`loop_counter`, `length`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
