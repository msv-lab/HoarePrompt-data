Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `inputarray` with at least 3 elements, where each element is in the range [0, 10^9]. It first checks if `func_2(inputarray)` returns `True`. If so, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If not, it iterates up to 100 times, finding the highest number in the array excluding the first and last elements, creating a new array based on this highest number, and checking if `func_2(newArray)` returns `True`. If `func_2(newArray)` returns `True` at any point, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If the loop completes without finding such a case, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. The function can return 'YES', 'NO', or `None` based on the conditions met during its execution.**
