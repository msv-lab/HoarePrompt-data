Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_3` does not guarantee that all elements can be reduced to zero. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the array `[2, 2, 2]`. According to the problem description, we can apply the operation to reduce the middle element by 2, but this operation also reduces the adjacent elements by 1. This means that after applying the operation once, the array becomes `[1, 0, 1]`. From this point, no further operations can reduce the array to all zeros because the middle element is zero, and the adjacent elements cannot be reduced without violating the operation rules.

The current implementation of `func_3` does not account for such scenarios, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
