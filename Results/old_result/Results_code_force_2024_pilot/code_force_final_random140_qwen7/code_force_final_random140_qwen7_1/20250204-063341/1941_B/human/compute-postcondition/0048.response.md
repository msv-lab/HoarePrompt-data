Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `elementIndex` and `length`. Therefore, these are the only variables that need to be considered for adjustment.

2. **Determine the initial values required for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `elementIndex` set to `length - 2`.
   - The loop condition is `elementIndex` in the range `1` to `length - 1`.

3. **Check if the initial state satisfies the loop condition**:
   - Given `elementIndex` is initially set to `length - 2`, we need to ensure that this value falls within the range `1` to `length - 1`.
   - Since `length` is the length of `inputarray`, and `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, we need to ensure that `length - 2` is at least `1` and less than `length - 1`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `elementIndex` should be `length - 2` to start the loop.
   - Ensure that `length` is such that `length - 2` is within the valid range.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `elementIndex` and `length`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `length` must be greater than 2**
