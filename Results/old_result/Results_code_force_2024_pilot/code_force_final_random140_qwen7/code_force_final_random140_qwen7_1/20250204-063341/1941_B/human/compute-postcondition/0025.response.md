Output State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[3]`, `highestIndex` is 3**

Explanation: The code sets `highestNumber` to the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. Given that `elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` is now set to `inputarray[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
