Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the current `highestNumber` and `inputarray[elementIndex]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, and `loop_counter` is less than 100.**

Explanation: The code `length = len(inputarray)` calculates the length of the `inputarray` and assigns it to the variable `length`. This changes the value of `length` to the actual length of `inputarray`, but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the other variables remain in their initial states as described in the initial state.
