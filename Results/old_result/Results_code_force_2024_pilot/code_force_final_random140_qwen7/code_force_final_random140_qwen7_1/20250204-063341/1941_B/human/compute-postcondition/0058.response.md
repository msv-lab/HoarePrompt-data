Postcondition: `elementIndex` is decremented from `length - 1`, and `highestIndex` is either equal to `elementIndex` (if `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`) or unchanged (if `inputarray[elementIndex]` is less than `highestNumber`). `highestNumber` remains the same unless `inputarray[elementIndex]` is found to be less than `highestNumber`, in which case `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[elementIndex]`.
