Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where each element is in the range [0, 10^9]; `answers` is a list with the element 'YES' appended.**

The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `answers`. Since the initial state of `inputarray` and the condition for `func_2` returning `True` are unchanged, these remain as part of the output state.
