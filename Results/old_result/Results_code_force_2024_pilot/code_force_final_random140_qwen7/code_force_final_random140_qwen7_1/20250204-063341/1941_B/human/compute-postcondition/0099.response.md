Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, and `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array; `answers` list now contains 'NO'**.

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the `answers` list. Since the initial state of `elementIndex`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` remains unchanged, these values are preserved. The only new information is that the `answers` list now includes the element `'NO'`.
