### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the program and their roles. Let's break down the analysis further to ensure the program meets all requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the operation as described in the problem statement. It decreases the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly checks if all elements in the array are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`. This part is also correct.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the input array zero by repeatedly applying the operation described in `func_1`.
     - If the initial array is already all zeros, it immediately returns 'YES'. This is correct.
     - If the array is not all zeros, it enters a loop where it finds the highest non-zero element, applies the operation, and checks again.
     - The loop runs up to 100 iterations to avoid infinite loops. This is a reasonable safeguard against infinite loops.

4. **Key Points to Check**:
   - **Initial Condition Check**: `func_2` correctly checks if all elements are zero.
   - **Operation Application**: `func_1` correctly applies the operation and updates the array.
   - **Termination Condition**: The loop in `func_3` runs up to 100 iterations, which is a reasonable limit to prevent infinite loops. If the loop completes without making all elements zero, it correctly returns 'NO'.

### Testing the Functionality

Given the problem constraints and the logic in `func_3`, we need to ensure that:
- The function correctly identifies arrays that can be made zero.
- The function correctly handles arrays that cannot be made zero.
- The function does not enter an infinite loop.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - `func_2` correctly checks if all elements are zero.
   - If the array is already all zeros, `func_3` returns 'YES' immediately, which is correct.

2. **Operation Application**:
   - `func_1` correctly applies the operation as specified.
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to modify the array and checks the result.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - `func_3` uses a loop counter to prevent infinite loops.
   - If the loop runs 100 times without making all elements zero, it correctly returns 'NO'.

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the program and ensures that the logic is sound. The program correctly handles the initial condition check, the operation application, and the termination condition.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
