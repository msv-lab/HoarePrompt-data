Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length`, `highestIndex` is `elementIndex`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the current `highestNumber` and `inputarray[elementIndex]`**

Explanation: The line `highestIndex = elementIndex` assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`. Since `elementIndex` is equal to `length`, `highestIndex` also becomes `length`. The value of `highestNumber` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it in this line of code.
