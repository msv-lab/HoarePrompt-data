Postcondition: `loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is 3, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value between `inputarray[3]` and `highestNumber`. If `inputarray[3]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[3]` and `highestIndex` is 3.
