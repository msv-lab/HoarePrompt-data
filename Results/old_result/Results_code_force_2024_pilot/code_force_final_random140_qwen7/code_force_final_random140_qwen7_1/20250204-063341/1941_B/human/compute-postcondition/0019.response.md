Output State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` is inputarray[2]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to the variable `highestNumber`. Given that `elementIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[2]`. The values of `loop_counter`, `length`, and `elementIndex` remain unchanged.
