Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length - 1`; `highestIndex` is equal to `elementIndex`; `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`**.

This means that `elementIndex` remains `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is set to `elementIndex`, and `highestNumber` is assigned the value of the element at index `elementIndex` in the `inputarray`.
