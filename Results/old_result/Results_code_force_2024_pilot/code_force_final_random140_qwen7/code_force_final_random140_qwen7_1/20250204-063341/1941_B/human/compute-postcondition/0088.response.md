Output State: **`elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` is 2**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 2) to `highestIndex`. The length of `inputarray` is not used in this code snippet, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, `elementIndex` and `highestIndex` both hold the value 2.
