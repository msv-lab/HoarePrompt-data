Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` is 1.
   - `length` is the length of `inputarray`.
   - If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `elementIndex = 1` to `elementIndex = length - 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `elementIndex` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `elementIndex = 1` and increments by 1 each time, the next value of `elementIndex` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` will be 2.
   - `length` remains the same (the length of `inputarray`).
   - `highestNumber` remains unchanged unless `inputarray[2]` is greater than `highestNumber`, but this condition is not specified in the given postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`elementIndex` is 2, `length` is the length of `inputarray`**
