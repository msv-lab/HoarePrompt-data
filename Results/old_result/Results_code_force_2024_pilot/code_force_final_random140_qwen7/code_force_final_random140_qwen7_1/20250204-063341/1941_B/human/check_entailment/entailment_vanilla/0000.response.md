Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs the operation described in the problem statement.
   - It takes an array and an index `i`, and modifies the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
   - The function returns the modified array.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the input array zero by repeatedly applying the operation described in `func_1`.
   - If the initial array already satisfies the condition (all elements are zero), it immediately returns 'YES'.
   - If the array does not satisfy the condition initially, it enters a loop where it finds the highest non-zero element, applies the operation, and checks again.
   - The loop runs up to 100 iterations to avoid infinite loops.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The function should correctly identify if the array is already all zeros.

2. **Operation Application**:
   - The function should correctly apply the operation and update the array.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The function should terminate correctly when it either makes all elements zero or determines that it cannot do so within 100 iterations.

### Testing the Functionality

Given the problem constraints and the logic in `func_3`, we need to ensure that:
- The function correctly identifies arrays that can be made zero.
- The function correctly handles arrays that cannot be made zero.
- The function does not enter an infinite loop.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - `func_2` correctly checks if all elements are zero.
   - If the array is already all zeros, `func_3` returns 'YES' immediately, which is correct.

2. **Operation Application**:
   - `func_1` correctly applies the operation as specified.
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to modify the array and checks the result.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - `func_3` uses a loop counter to prevent infinite loops.
   - If the loop runs 100 times without making all elements zero, it correctly returns 'NO'.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It checks the initial condition, applies the operation, and handles the termination condition appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
