Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `elementIndex`.
   - The loop range is `range(1, length - 1)`, which means `elementIndex` starts from 1 and goes up to `length - 2`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `elementIndex` is `length - 2`.
   - `length` must be greater than 2.
   - If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` remains unchanged.
   - If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is less than `highestNumber`, then the postcondition does not provide specific information about the values of `highestNumber`, but maintains the condition that `highestNumber` has not been updated by this if-else block.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `elementIndex`:**
   - Since the loop increments `elementIndex` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `elementIndex` would be `length - 1`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `elementIndex` will be incremented to `length - 1`.
   - `length` remains the same and must still be greater than 2.
   - The condition for `highestNumber` is not specified for the next iteration, so it remains as per the current state unless `inputarray[elementIndex]` is checked and found to be less than `highestNumber`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `length` must be greater than 2, and `highestNumber` has not been updated by this if-else block.**
