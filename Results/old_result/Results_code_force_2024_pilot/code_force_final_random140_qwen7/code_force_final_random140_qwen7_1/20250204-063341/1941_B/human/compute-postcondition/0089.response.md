Output State: **`elementIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` is inputarray[2]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to the variable `highestNumber`. Given that `elementIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[2]`. The value of `highestIndex` remains unchanged at 2.
