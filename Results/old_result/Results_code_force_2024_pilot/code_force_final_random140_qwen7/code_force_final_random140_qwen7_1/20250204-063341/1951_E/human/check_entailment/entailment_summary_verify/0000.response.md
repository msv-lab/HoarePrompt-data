### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It splits the string into two halves and compares them.
   - If the halves are equal when reversed, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses `func_1` to determine the nature of the input string `ch`.
   - If the length of `ch` is even:
     - If the first half of `ch` is a palindrome (`func_1` returns `True`), it returns `3`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `4`.
   - If the length of `ch` is odd:
     - If the first half of `ch` (excluding the middle character) is a palindrome (`func_1` returns `True`), it returns `1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `2`.

Given these functions, the program does not attempt to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. Instead, it only checks if the entire string or its halves are palindromic. Here's why the original assessment is correct:

- **Test Case Analysis**:
  - Consider the test case `test_case = "aba"`:
    - `func_1("aba")` returns `True` because "aba" is a palindrome.
    - `func_2("aba")` returns `3` because the length of "aba" is even and the first half is a palindrome.
    - The program outputs "YES" with `1` as the number of parts and "aba" as the single part, which is incorrect.

- **Partitioning Requirement**:
  - The problem requires partitioning the string into substrings that are not palindromes.
  - The provided functions do not provide any mechanism to achieve this partitioning.

- **Function Summaries**:
  - The summaries confirm that `func_2` only checks if the input string or its halves are palindromic, without attempting to partition the string.

Since the program does not implement the required functionality to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.
