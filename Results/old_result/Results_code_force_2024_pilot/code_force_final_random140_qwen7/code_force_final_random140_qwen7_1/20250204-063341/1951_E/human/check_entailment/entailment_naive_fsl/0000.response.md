Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main requirement of partitioning the string into substrings that are not palindromes. Instead, they seem to be checking if a given string is a palindrome or not.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
test_case = "aba"
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the program will output:
```
YES
1
aba
```

This is incorrect because the string "aba" is a palindrome, and the program should output "NO" since it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

Additionally, the program does not provide a mechanism to actually partition the string into non-palindromic substrings, which is required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
