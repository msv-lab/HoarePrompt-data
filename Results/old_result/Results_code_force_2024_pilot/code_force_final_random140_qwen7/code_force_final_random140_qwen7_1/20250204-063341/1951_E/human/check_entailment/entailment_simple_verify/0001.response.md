### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to confirm the reasoning provided in the original assessment.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome by comparing the first half with the reversed second half.
   - The logic is sound and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to determine how many parts a string can be split into such that none of the parts are palindromes.
   - The logic in `func_2` is fundamentally flawed and does not address the problem correctly. Here are the issues:
     - It does not check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
     - It categorizes the string based on whether the first half is a palindrome or not, which is irrelevant to the partitioning problem.
     - The conditions inside `func_2` do not reflect the actual requirement of partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initial State Check**:
   - The program first checks if the entire string `s` is a single character repeated (`s == s[0] * len(s)`). If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because a single repeated character is a palindrome.
   - It also checks if the string can be split into two identical halves (`s == s[:2] * (len(s) // 2) + s[0]`). If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because the string would still be a palindrome.

2. **Partitioning Logic**:
   - If `T1` is `True` and `func_1(s)` returns `True`, it means the string is a palindrome.
   - The program then calls `func_2(s)` to determine how many parts the string can be split into.
   - `func_2(s)` returns values `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` based on certain conditions, but these conditions are not relevant to the partitioning problem.
   - Based on the value returned by `func_2(s)`, the program attempts to split the string accordingly:
     - If `a == 0`, it sets `s` to a list containing the string itself.
     - If `a == 1`, it splits the string into two parts.
     - If `a == 2`, it attempts to split the string into three parts.
     - If `a == 3`, it splits the string into two parts.
     - If `a == 4`, it splits the string into two parts.

3. **Partition Validation**:
   - The program then checks if the resulting parts are non-palindromic.
   - If any part is a palindrome, it sets `T1` to `False`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `T1` is `True`, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If `T1` is `False`, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for determining the number of parts using `func_2` is incorrect and does not solve the problem of partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
