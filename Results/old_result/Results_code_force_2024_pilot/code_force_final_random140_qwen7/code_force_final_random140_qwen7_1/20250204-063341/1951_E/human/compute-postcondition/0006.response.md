Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is half the length of `ch`, rounded down, and the length of `ch` is even; if the first `b` characters of `ch` satisfy the condition returned by `func_1`, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, `func_1(ch[:b])` returns False, and `a` is 4.
