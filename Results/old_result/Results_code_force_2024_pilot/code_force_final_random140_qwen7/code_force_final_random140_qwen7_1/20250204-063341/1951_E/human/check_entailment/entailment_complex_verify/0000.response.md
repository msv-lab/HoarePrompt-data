### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if the first half of the string `ch` is a reverse of the second half.
- It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
- This function is used to check if a string is a palindrome, but it doesn't help in partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function determines how many parts the string `ch` can be divided into based on the result of `func_1`.
- It returns:
  - `1` if the string is a palindrome and has an even length.
  - `2` if the string is a palindrome and has an odd length.
  - `3` if the string is not a palindrome and has an even length.
  - `4` if the string is not a palindrome and has an odd length.
- This function also doesn't help in partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.

#### Main Program Logic:
- The main logic of the program checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome or can be split into smaller palindromic substrings.
- It uses the results from `func_1` and `func_2` to decide how to partition the string.
- However, the program does not actually perform the partitioning into non-palindromic substrings. Instead, it only checks if the string can be split in certain ways based on the results of `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `"aba"`
- Expected Output: `"NO"` because "aba" is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- Actual Output: `"YES"` with `1` part, which is incorrect.

The program incorrectly outputs `"YES"` and `1` part for the string `"aba"`. This is because the program does not properly handle the case where the string is a single non-palindromic substring or cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not partition the string into non-palindromic substrings when necessary. It only checks if the string is a palindrome or can be split in certain ways, but it does not ensure that the resulting substrings are non-palindromic.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
