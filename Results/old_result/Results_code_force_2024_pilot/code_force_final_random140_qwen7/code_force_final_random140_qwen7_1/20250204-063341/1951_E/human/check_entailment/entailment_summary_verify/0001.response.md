### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that `func_2` does not solve the problem of partitioning a string into non-palindromic substrings. Let's break down the issues and verify the function summaries and the overall logic.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It works correctly by splitting the string into two halves and comparing them, considering both even and odd lengths.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to determine the minimum number of non-palindromic substrings needed to partition the input string `ch`.
   - The provided function summary states that `func_2` returns 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on certain conditions related to the first half of the string being a palindrome.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is indeed flawed and does not correctly solve the problem. It does not check for the possibility of partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.

Given the problem requirements, `func_2` should:
- Check if the entire string is a palindrome.
- If the string is not a palindrome, return 1.
- If the string is a palindrome, try to find the smallest partition that ensures no substring is a palindrome.

The function `func_2` does not implement this logic. Instead, it checks the first half of the string for palindromic properties, which is irrelevant to the partitioning problem.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1**: `sinktheyacht`
  - The entire string is not a palindrome, so the correct answer is `1`.
  - `func_2` should return 1, but it does not correctly handle this case.

- **Example 2**: `lllllllll`
  - Every substring is a palindrome, so the correct answer is `0`.
  - `func_2` does not correctly handle this case and returns an incorrect value.

- **Example 3**: `uwuowouwu`
  - The string can be partitioned into `["uw", "uow", "ouwu"]`, so the correct answer is `3`.
  - `func_2` does not correctly handle this case and returns an incorrect value.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified that `func_2` is flawed and does not solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
