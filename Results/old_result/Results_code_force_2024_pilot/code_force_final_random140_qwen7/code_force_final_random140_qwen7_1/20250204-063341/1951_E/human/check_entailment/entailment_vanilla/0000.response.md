Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It works correctly for both even-length and odd-length strings by splitting the string into two halves and comparing them.
   - If the first half is equal to the reverse of the second half, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to determine how many parts a string can be split into such that none of the parts are palindromes.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly solve the problem.

#### Issues with `func_2`:
- **Incorrect Logic**:
  - The function `func_2` does not actually check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
  - Instead, it tries to categorize the string based on whether the first half is a palindrome or not, which is not relevant to the partitioning problem.
  - The conditions inside `func_2` do not reflect the actual requirement of partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the examples from the problem statement to see why `func_2` is incorrect:

- **Example 1**: `sinktheyacht`
  - The function should return `1` because the entire string is not a palindrome.
  - However, `func_2` will not correctly handle this case.

- **Example 2**: `lllllllll`
  - The function should return `0` because every possible substring is a palindrome.
  - However, `func_2` will incorrectly return a value based on the length and palindromic properties of the first half, which is not relevant.

- **Example 3**: `uwuowouwu`
  - The function should return `3` and provide a valid partition like `["uw", "uow", "ouwu"]`.
  - However, `func_2` will not correctly handle this case either.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem of partitioning a string into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
