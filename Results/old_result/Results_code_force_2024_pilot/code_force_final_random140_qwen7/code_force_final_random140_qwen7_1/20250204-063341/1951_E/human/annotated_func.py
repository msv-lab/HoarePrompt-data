#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Specifically, if the length of `ch` is even, it returns 3 if the first half of `ch` satisfies the condition checked by `func_1`, otherwise it returns 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, it returns 1 if the first half of `ch` (excluding the middle character) satisfies the condition checked by `func_1`, otherwise it returns 2.
