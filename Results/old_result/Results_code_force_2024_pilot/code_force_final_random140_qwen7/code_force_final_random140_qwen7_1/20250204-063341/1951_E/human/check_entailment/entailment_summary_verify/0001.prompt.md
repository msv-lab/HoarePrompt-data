You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(ch):
    if len(ch) % 2 == 0:
        x = len(ch) // 2
    else:
        x = len(ch) // 2 + 1
    if ch[:len(ch) // 2] == ch[x:][::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False

#Function 2:
def func_2(ch):
    b = len(ch) // 2
    if len(ch) % 2 == 0:
        if func_1(ch[:b]):
            a = 3
        else:
            a = 4
    elif func_1(ch[:b]):
        a = 1
    else:
        a = 2
    return a



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Specifically, if the length of `ch` is even, it returns 3 if the first half of `ch` satisfies the condition checked by `func_1`, otherwise it returns 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, it returns 1 if the first half of `ch` (excluding the middle character) satisfies the condition checked by `func_1`, otherwise it returns 2.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It works correctly for both even-length and odd-length strings by splitting the string into two halves and comparing them.
   - If the first half is equal to the reverse of the second half, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to determine how many parts a string can be split into such that none of the parts are palindromes.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly solve the problem.

#### Issues with `func_2`:
- **Incorrect Logic**:
  - The function `func_2` does not actually check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
  - Instead, it tries to categorize the string based on whether the first half is a palindrome or not, which is not relevant to the partitioning problem.
  - The conditions inside `func_2` do not reflect the actual requirement of partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the examples from the problem statement to see why `func_2` is incorrect:

- **Example 1**: `sinktheyacht`
  - The function should return `1` because the entire string is not a palindrome.
  - However, `func_2` will not correctly handle this case.

- **Example 2**: `lllllllll`
  - The function should return `0` because every possible substring is a palindrome.
  - However, `func_2` will incorrectly return a value based on the length and palindromic properties of the first half, which is not relevant.

- **Example 3**: `uwuowouwu`
  - The function should return `3` and provide a valid partition like `["uw", "uow", "ouwu"]`.
  - However, `func_2` will not correctly handle this case either.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem of partitioning a string into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
