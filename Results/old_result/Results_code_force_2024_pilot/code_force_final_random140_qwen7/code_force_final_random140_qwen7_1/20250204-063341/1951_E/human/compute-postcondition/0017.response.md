Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is half the length of `ch`, rounded down. If the length of `ch` is even, `a` is 3 if the first `b` characters of `ch` satisfy the condition returned by `func_1`; otherwise, `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, `a` is 1 if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`; otherwise, `a` is 2.
