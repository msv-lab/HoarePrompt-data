### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
- It splits the string into two halves and checks if the first half is equal to the reverse of the second half.
- The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function determines the number of partitions needed for a string `ch` to ensure no substring is a palindrome.
- Based on the length of `ch` and the result of `func_1`, it returns:
  - `1` if the first half is a palindrome.
  - `2` if the entire string is a palindrome.
  - `3` if the first half is not a palindrome.
  - `4` if the first half is a palindrome and the entire string is a palindrome.

#### Main Program Logic:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the string `s`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - Check if `s` is a single character repeated (`s == s[0] * len(s)`).
   - Check if `s` can be split into two identical halves (`s == s[:2] * (len(s) // 2) + s[0]`).

3. **Partition Logic**:
   - If `s` is a palindrome, set `T1` to `False`.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, use `func_2` to determine the number of partitions needed.
   - Based on the value of `a` from `func_2`, attempt to partition `s` accordingly:
     - If `a == 0`, the string is already non-palindromic.
     - If `a == 1`, split the string at the midpoint.
     - If `a == 2`, check if the string can be split into two non-palindromic parts.
     - If `a == 3`, split the string after the first half.
     - If `a == 4`, split the string before the second half.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid partition is found, print "YES" followed by the number of partitions and the partitioned substrings.
   - If no valid partition is found, print "NO".

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**:
   - The logic in the main program does not correctly handle the partitioning of strings into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The program attempts to split the string based on the results of `func_2`, but these results do not guarantee a valid partition.
   - For example, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for a palindrome string like "aba" and fails to provide a valid partition.

2. **Lack of Proper Partitioning**:
   - The program does not have a robust mechanism to ensure that each partitioned substring is non-palindromic.
   - The logic for splitting the string into non-palindromic parts is flawed and does not always produce a valid partition.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as strings with lengths that are powers of 2 or other specific patterns that require more complex partitioning.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly partition the string into non-palindromic substrings and fails to handle various edge cases properly.
