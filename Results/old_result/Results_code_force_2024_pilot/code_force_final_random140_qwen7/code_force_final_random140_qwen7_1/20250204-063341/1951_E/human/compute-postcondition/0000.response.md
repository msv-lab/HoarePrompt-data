Output State: **`ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters; `b` is half the length of `ch`, rounded down.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of the length of `ch` divided by 2, using integer division (`//`), which means `b` will be the floor of the length of `ch` divided by 2. The state of `ch` remains unchanged.
