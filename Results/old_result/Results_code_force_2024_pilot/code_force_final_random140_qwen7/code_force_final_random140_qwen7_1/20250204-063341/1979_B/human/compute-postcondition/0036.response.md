Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `1`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop, and `l2` will have 4 elements (with the last element being `0`). In the case where the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` will have 4 elements with the last element being `0`. Otherwise, `l1` will have an additional `0` appended, and `l2` will have 3 elements all of which are `1`.
