Output State: **`n` is 4, `x` is `t // 8`, `y` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop, and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(l2)` assigns the length of `l2` to `n`. Given that `l2` has 4 elements (with the last element being `0`), `n` is set to `4`. The values of `x`, `y`, `l1`, and `l2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
