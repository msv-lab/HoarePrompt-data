Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `1`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop with an additional `0` appended, `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop with 3 elements all of which are `1`, and the length of `l2` is greater than the length of `l1`.**

This means that the list `l1` now contains one more element, which is `0`, appended to its previous contents. The list `l2` remains unchanged with three elements all being `1`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
