Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l2` is a list with one element which is `y % 2`, `y` is halved.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y % 2` was the only element in `l2`, `l2` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `x`, and `l2` remain as they were in the initial state, except that `y` is now half of its original value.
