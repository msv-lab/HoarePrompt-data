Output State: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2` raised to the power of 3 (i.e., `x // 8` if `x` was originally a positive integer), `y` is an integer obtained from input split, and `l1` contains the values of `x % 2` appended to the list three times.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will have been halved three times, resulting in `x` being reduced to `x // 8` if it was originally a positive integer. The list `l1` will contain the result of `x % 2` appended three times, which represents the binary digits of the original `x` value, starting from the least significant bit.
