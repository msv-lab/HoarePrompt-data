Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2 ** n-1` (since the loop runs `n-1` times), `y` is an integer obtained from input split, and `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x` as a list of integers.

Explanation: The loop continues to divide `x` by 2 and append the remainder (`x % 2`) to `l1` until `x` becomes 0. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `x` will be reduced to `x // 2 ** (n-1)`. The list `l1` will contain the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, which can be read correctly by reversing the list if needed.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l2` is a list with one element which is `y % 2`, `y` is halved.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l2` is a list with two elements where the first element is `y % 2` and the second element is also `y % 2`, `y` is halved.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l2` is a list with three elements where the first element is `y % 2` and the second and third elements are also `y % 2`, `y` is halved.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
