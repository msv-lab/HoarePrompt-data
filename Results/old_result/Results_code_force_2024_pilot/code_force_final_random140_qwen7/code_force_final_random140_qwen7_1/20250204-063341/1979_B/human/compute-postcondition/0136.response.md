Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `y`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is non-zero (`y != 0`).

2. **Identify the relevant states**: The only variable in the loop head is `y`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `y` to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: Right before the loop, `y` is an input integer. For the loop to execute at least once, `y` must be non-zero. If `y` is zero, the loop will not start.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is now `0`
- `y` is an input integer
- `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`
- `i` will be equal to `n`
- `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order
- `l2` is an empty list

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `y` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is now `0`, `y` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is an empty list**
