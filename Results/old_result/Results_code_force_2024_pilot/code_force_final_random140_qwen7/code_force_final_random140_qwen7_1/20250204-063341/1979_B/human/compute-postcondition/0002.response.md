Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
