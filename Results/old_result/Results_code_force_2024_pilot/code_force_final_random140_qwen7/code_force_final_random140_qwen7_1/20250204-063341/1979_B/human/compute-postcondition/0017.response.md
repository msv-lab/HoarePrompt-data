Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `y // 2`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the integer result back to `y`. Since `y` was originally a non-zero integer from the input split, after this operation, `y` is now half of its original value (integer division). All other variables remain unchanged.
