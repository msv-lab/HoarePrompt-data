Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is an input integer divided by 2 and must be non-zero, `cnt` is the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, `l2` now contains another element which is `y % 2` and `y` is now `y // 2**.

The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` was initially an input integer divided by 2 and must be non-zero, after executing the code, `y` is now `y // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
