The loop condition is `x`, meaning the loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` has been updated to `x // 2`.

To determine the necessary adjustments, let's break down the loop head:

- The only variable in the loop head is `x`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be non-zero.

Given that `x` has been updated to `x // 2` at the end of the previous iteration, `x` will be zero if it was even, and non-zero if it was odd. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be non-zero.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is non-zero at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`x` must be non-zero**
