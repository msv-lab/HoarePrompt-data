Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from input split.**

Explanation: 
- The loop condition is `range(t)`, and since `i` is 2, the loop has already completed one iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 3.
- The line `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. These values are not specified in the initial state, so they are simply described as integers obtained from input split.
- The values of `n` and `i` are updated based on the loop condition and the fact that `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `t` remains at least 3 for the loop to continue.
