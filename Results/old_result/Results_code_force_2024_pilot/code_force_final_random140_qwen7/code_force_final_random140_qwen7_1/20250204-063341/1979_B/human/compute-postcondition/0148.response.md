Postcondition: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list of binary digits representing the value of `y` in reverse order. The length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`**.
