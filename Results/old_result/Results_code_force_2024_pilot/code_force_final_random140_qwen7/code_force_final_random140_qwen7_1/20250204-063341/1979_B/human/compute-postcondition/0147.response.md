Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`, `l2` ends with a 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value `0` to the list `l2`. This changes the value of `l2` such that it now ends with a `0`. The values of `x`, `y`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
