Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `cnt` is either 1 or 2
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`

The `print(2 ** cnt)` statement will compute \(2\) raised to the power of `cnt`.

Since `cnt` is either 1 or 2, we have two possible outcomes:

1. If `cnt` is 1, then \(2^1 = 2\).
2. If `cnt` is 2, then \(2^2 = 4\).

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `cnt`.

Output: **2 or 4 (depending on the value of cnt, which is either 1 or 2)**
