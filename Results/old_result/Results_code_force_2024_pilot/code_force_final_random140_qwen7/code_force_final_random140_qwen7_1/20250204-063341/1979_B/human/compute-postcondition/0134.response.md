Output State: `x` is now `0`, `y` is an input integer, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero. Each iteration of the loop appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (which gives either 0 or 1) to the list `l1`. Then, `x` is updated to its integer division by 2, effectively removing the last binary digit. This process repeats until `x` becomes 0. At that point, `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x`, but in reverse order. The variables `y`, `cnt`, `i`, `l1`, and `l2` retain their states from the last iteration of the loop since they are not modified within the loop.
