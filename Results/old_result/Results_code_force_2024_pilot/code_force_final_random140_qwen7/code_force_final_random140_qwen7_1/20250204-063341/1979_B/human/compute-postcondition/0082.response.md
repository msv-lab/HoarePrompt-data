Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l2` is a list with two elements where the first element is `y % 2` and the second element is also `y % 2`, `y` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code appends `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `l2` initially had one element which was `y % 2`, after appending, `l2` will have two elements, both of which are `y % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
