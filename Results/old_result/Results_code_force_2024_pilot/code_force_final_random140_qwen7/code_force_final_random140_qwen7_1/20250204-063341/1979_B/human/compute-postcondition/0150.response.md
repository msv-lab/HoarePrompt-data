Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list of binary digits representing the value of `y` in reverse order, the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`, the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, and `l1` has been appended with the value 0.**

Explanation: The code `l1.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `l1`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
