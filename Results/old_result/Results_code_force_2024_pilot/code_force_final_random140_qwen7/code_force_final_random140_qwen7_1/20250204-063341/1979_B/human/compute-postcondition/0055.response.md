The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be at least 2.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2**
