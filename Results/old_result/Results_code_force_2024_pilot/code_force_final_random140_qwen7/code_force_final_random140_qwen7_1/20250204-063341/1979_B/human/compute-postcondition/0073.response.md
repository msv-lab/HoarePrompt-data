Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is half of its original value (non-zero), `y` is an integer obtained from input split, `l1` contains the value of `x % 2` appended to the list.**

Explanation: The code appends `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` is half of its original value and non-zero, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd. However, the exact value of `x % 2` is not specified, so we keep it in terms of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
