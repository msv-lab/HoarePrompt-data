The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.

To determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The variable `n` must still satisfy the condition that it is at least 1.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1. However, without knowing the exact previous value of `i`, we can only say that `i` is now `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
