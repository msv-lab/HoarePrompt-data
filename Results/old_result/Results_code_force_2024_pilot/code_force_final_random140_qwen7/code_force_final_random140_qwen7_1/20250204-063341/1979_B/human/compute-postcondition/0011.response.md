Output State: **`x` must be non-zero; `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (`x % 2`) to the list `l1`. Since `x` is non-zero, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `x` is even or odd. The initial state of `x` being non-zero is preserved, and `l1` is updated to include this new value.
