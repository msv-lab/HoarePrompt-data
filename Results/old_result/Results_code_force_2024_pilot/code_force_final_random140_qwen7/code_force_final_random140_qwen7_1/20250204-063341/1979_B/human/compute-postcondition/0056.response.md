Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After executing the code, `cnt` is now 1. The conditions and values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
