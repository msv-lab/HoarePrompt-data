Postcondition: `n` is the length of `l1`, `x` is `t // 8`, `y` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop, and if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `n` remains 4. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
