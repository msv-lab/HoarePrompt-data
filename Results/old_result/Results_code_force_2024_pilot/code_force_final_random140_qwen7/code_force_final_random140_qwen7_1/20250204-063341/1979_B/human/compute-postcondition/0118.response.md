Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it implies that the `break` statement is part of a larger context that is not shown. However, based on the given initial state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged except for the fact that we have broken out of the implied loop or conditional block.
