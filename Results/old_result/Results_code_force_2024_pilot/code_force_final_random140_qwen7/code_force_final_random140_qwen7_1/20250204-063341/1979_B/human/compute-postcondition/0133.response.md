Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2`, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is divided by 2 using floor division (`//`), making it half of its original value (and rounded down if it was not an integer). The list `l1` remains unchanged as it only contains the value of `x % 2` from the initial state, which does not get updated by the given code.
