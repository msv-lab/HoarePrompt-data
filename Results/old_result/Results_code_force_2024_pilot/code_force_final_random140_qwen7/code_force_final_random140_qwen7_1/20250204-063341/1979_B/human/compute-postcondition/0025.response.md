Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `1` (since `y` must be halved until it becomes 1 or less, and given the constraints, it will eventually become 1), `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop, and `l2` will have 3 elements, all of which are `1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the original value of `t` divided by \(8\) (since the loop runs 3 times, and \(2^3 = 8\)). The variable `y` will be reduced to `1` because it starts as an integer from the input and is halved in each iteration until it reaches `1`. The list `l1` will contain the results of `x % 2` for each of the 3 iterations, and `l2` will contain the results of `y % 2` for each of the 3 iterations, which will all be `1` since `y` is initially an odd number and gets halved to `1`.
