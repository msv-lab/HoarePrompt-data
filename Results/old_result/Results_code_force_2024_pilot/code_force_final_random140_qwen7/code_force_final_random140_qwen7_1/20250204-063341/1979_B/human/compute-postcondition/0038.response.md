Postcondition: `n` is the length of `l1`, `x` is `t // 8`, `y` is `1`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop, and `l2` will have 4 elements (with the last element being `0`). The length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.
