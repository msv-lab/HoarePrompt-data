Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l2` is a list with one element which is `y % 2`**

The code appends the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. However, the value of `y` is not specified in the initial state, so we can only say that `l2` will contain one element, which is the remainder of `y` divided by 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
