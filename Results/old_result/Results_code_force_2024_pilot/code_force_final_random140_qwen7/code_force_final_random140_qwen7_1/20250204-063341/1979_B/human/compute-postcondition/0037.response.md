Output State: **`n` is the length of `l1`, `x` is `t // 8`, `y` is `1`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop, and `l2` will have 4 elements (with the last element being `0`).**

Explanation: The code `n = len(l1)` assigns the length of the list `l1` to the variable `n`. The values of `x`, `y`, `l1`, and `l2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
