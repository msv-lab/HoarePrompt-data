Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` must be a non-zero integer from the input split, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends `y % 2` to the list `l2`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `l1` remain unchanged. The list `l2` now includes the value of `y % 2`.
