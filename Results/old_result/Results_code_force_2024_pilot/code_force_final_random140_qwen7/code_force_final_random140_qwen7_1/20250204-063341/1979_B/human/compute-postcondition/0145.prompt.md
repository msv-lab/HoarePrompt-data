Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `x` is now `0`, `y` is an input integer, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is non-zero. Each iteration appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (which gives the least significant bit of `x`) to the list `l1`. Then, `x` is updated to its integer division by 2 (effectively shifting it right by one bit). This process repeats until `x` becomes 0. At that point, `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x` in reverse order, since each bit was added from the least significant to the most significant.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer divided by 2 and must be non-zero, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit of `y`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer divided by 2 and must be non-zero, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` now contains the least significant bit of `y`. `y` is an input integer divided by 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer divided by 2 and must be non-zero, `cnt` is the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, `l2` now contains another element which is `y % 2` and `y` is now `y // 2


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
