Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial conditions for `cnt` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `cnt` will still be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will still be equal to `n`.
