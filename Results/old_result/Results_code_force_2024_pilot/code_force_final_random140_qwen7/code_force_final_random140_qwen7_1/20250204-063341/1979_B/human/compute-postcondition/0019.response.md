Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` must be at least 2, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2`, and `l2` has one additional element which is `y % 2`.**

This means that the list `l2` has appended the value of `y % 2` to its end, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
