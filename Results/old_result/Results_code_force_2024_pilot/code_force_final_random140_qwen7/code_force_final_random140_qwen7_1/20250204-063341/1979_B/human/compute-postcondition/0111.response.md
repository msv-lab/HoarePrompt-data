Postcondition: `n` must be at least 1. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements at the same index in `l2`, then `cnt` is increased by 1, and the elements at each index of `l1` remain equal to the corresponding elements at the same index in `l2`. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` are not equal to the corresponding elements at the same index in `l2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
