Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is now `t // (2 ** 3)`, `y` is an integer from the input split, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the original value of `t` divided by \(2^3\) (since the loop runs 3 times), which simplifies to `t // 8`. The list `l1` will contain the results of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, meaning it will have 3 elements corresponding to the binary representation of `t` starting from the least significant bit.
