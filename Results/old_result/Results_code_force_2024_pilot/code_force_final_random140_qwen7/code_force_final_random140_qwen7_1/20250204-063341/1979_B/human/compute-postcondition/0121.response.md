Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.
- After all iterations, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`.
- `i` will be equal to `n`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1` (inclusive).
2. For each iteration, it checks if `l1[i] == l2[i]`.
3. If they are equal, `cnt` is incremented.
4. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop condition `i < n` will no longer be true.

The value of `cnt` is the number of indices where `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`.

The expression `2 ** cnt` calculates 2 raised to the power of `cnt`.

Therefore, the output will be \(2\) raised to the power of the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`.

Output: **2 ** cnt** (where cnt is the count of indices where l1[i] equals l2[i])**
