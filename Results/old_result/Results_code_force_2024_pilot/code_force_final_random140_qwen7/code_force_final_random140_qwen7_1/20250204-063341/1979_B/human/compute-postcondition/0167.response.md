Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 0
   - `y` is 0
   - `cnt` is either 1 or 0
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`
   - If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` is set to 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the lengths of `l1` and `l2` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `x` remains 0.
   - `y` remains 0.
   - `cnt` remains either 1 or 0, depending on the comparison of `l1[i]` and `l2[i]` from the previous iteration.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given this reasoning, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 0, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, and if `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` is set to 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
