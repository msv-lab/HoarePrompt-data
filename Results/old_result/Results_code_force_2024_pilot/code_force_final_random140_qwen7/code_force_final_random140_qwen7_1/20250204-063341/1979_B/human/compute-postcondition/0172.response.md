Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is 0
   - `y` is 0
   - `cnt` is either 1 or 2
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (so if it was 0 before, now it is 1)
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` was 0 before, now `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `x` remains 0
   - `y` remains 0
   - `cnt` remains either 1 or 2
   - `i` is now 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
