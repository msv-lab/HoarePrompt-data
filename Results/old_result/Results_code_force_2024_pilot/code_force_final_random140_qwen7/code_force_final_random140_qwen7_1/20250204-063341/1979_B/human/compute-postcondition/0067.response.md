Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an integer obtained from input split, and `x` must be non-zero; `l1` contains the value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` performs an integer division of `x` by 2 and assigns the result back to `x`. Since `x` is an integer obtained from input split and must be non-zero, after the operation, `x` becomes `x // 2`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `y`, and `l1`) remain unchanged.
