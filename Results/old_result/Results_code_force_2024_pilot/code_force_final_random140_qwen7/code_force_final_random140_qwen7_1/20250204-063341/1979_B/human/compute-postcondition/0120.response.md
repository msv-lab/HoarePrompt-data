Output State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`. After all iterations, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will hold the total number of positions where the elements of `l1` and `l2` are the same up to the last index checked. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of `l1` (and `l2`). The other variables (`t` and `x`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
