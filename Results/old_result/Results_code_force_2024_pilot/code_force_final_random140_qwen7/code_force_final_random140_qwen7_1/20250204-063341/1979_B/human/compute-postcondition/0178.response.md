Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `i` is n, and `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it finds a mismatch between `l1[i]` and `l2[i]` or reaches the end of the shorter list (whichever comes first). The variable `cnt` will hold the count of consecutive matching elements found before the first mismatch. Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds a non-matching pair, `cnt` will not exceed 1 if there is any mismatch. Therefore, `cnt` will be either 1 (if there was one matching pair followed by a mismatch) or 0 (if all elements up to `i-1` matched but `i` is the first mismatch, meaning `cnt` was never incremented). The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged at 0 because they were not involved in the loop operations.
