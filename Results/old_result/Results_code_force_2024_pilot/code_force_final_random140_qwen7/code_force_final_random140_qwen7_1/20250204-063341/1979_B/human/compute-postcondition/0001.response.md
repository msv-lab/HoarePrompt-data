State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, _ is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable used to iterate over the range of `t`. It does not hold any specific value that affects the loop's execution; hence, it does not need to be adjusted.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will execute. Since `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), this condition must be maintained for the loop to execute correctly.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is within the specified range.
