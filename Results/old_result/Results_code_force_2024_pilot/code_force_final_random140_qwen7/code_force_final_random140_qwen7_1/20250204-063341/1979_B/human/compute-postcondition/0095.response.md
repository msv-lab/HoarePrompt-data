Postcondition: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, then `l1` has a length of one more than its original length and contains the element 0. Otherwise, the lengths of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged and `x` is still `x // 2`.
