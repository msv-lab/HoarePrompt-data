Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an integer from the input split, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2` appended, `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is divided by 2 using integer division (`//`), which means `x` is now `x // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
