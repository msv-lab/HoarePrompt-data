Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `x` and `y` are still 0, `i` is still equal to `n`, and `n` is still the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`.
