Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2`, `l1` is a list containing the value of `(x % 2)`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is divided by 2 using floor division (`//`), which means `x` is now `x // 2`. The list `l1` contains the value of `x % 2`, which remains unchanged because the operation only affects `x`.
