Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now half of its original value, `y` is an integer obtained from input split, `l1` contains the value of `x % 2` appended to the list.**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the result back to `x`. Since `x` was originally a non-zero value, it is now half of its original value. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `y`, and `l1`) remain unchanged.
