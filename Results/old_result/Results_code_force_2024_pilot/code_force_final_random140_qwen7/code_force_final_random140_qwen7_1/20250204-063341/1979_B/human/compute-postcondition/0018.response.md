The loop condition is `while y:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `y` is non-zero.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `x` is now `t // 8`
- `y` is now `y // 2`
- `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop
- `l2` is a list containing `y % 2`

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be non-zero. Since `y` was updated to `y // 2` in the previous iteration, `y` must have been even (otherwise, it would have become zero).

Therefore, we need to ensure that `y` is still non-zero for the next iteration. Given that `y` was halved in the previous iteration, `y` must have been at least 2 in the previous state to ensure it can be halved again and remain non-zero.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` must be at least 2, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2`**
