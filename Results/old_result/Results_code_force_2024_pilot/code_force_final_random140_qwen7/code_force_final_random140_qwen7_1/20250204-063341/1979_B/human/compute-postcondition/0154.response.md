Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(l1)` assigns the length of list `l1` to the variable `n`. The values of `x`, `y`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` ends with a 0, and if the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`, `l1` has been appended with a 0 to match the length of `l2`, remains valid.
