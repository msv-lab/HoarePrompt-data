Output State: **`x` must be non-zero; `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` must be non-zero, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd. The initial condition that `x` must be non-zero remains unchanged.
