Postcondition: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` is equal to `n`. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` ends with a 0. If the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`, `l1` has been appended with a 0 to match the length of `l2`.**
