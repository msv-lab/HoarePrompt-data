Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l2` is a list with two elements where the first element is `y % 2` and the second element is also `y % 2`, `y` is halved.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` was initially greater than 0, it is now halved. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
