Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l2` is a list with three elements where the first element is `y % 2` and the second and third elements are also `y % 2`, `y` is halved.**

The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` must be at least 2, after the operation, `y` is halved. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
