You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    if cntl[j] == 0:
                        print(j)
                        break
                    else:
                        c -= 1
                        if not c:
                            print(j)
                            break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. It calculates the frequency of each number in the list \( a \) and determines the smallest index \( j \) (from 1 to \( n \)) that appears fewer than twice in the list. If no such index exists, it prints 0. If the number 0 does not appear in the list, it directly prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the smallest index of 0 if it appears fewer than twice, or the smallest index of any other number that appears fewer than twice.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the calculation of the MEX value. Specifically, the program does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob, and it incorrectly calculates the MEX value based on the counts of elements in the array.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Turns Not Accounted For**: The program does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. It simply counts the occurrences of each element in the array `a` and then tries to deduce the MEX value based on these counts without considering whose turn it is.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to find the minimum non-negative integer that is not present in the array `cntl`, but it does not properly handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob. This means the program cannot accurately determine the optimal MEX value based on the game's rules.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

- For the first test case `[0, 0, 1, 1]`:
  - Alice can pick `0`, then Bob picks `0`, then Alice picks `1`, and finally Bob picks `1`.
  - The resulting array `c` would be `[0, 1]`.
  - The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`.

- For the second test case `[0, 1, 2, 3]`:
  - Alice can pick `0`, then Bob picks `1`, then Alice picks `2`, and finally Bob picks `3`.
  - The resulting array `c` would be `[0, 2]`.
  - The MEX of `[0, 2]` is `1`.

- For the third test case `[1, 1]`:
  - Alice picks `1`, and Bob has no valid move since the array is now empty.
  - The resulting array `c` would be `[1]`.
  - The MEX of `[1]` is `0`.

The provided program does not simulate these turns and thus cannot correctly determine the MEX value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
