Output State: **All elements in `cntl` are set to 0, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is 0, and `cntl[1]` and `cntl[2]` are both greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cntl` as a list of `n + 1` zeros. Since all elements in `cntl` are initially incremented by 3 (from the initial state), they are now set to 0. The values of `j`, `n`, `c`, `cntl[1]`, and `cntl[2]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
