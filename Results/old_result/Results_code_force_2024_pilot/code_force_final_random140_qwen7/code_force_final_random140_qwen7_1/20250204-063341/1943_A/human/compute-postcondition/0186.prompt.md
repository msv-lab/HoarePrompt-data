Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list a contains n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                if cntl[j] == 0:
                    print(j)
                    break
                else:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c:
                        print(j)
                        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cntl[i]` for each index `i` in the list will be equal to the frequency of occurrence of `i` in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `j` is 4, `n` is at least 4, and `cntl[j]` is at least 2 for all `j` from 1 to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in `cntl` are incremented by 3. If `cntl[0]` equals 0, then `cntl[0]` remains 0. Otherwise, the value of `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is 0, and `cntl[1]` and `cntl[2]` are both greater than or equal to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `cntl` are incremented by the number of times each corresponding index appears in the list `a`, and `a` must contain at least three distinct elements. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `a` is processed normally. Otherwise, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and either `cntl[3]` is 0 indicating the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or `cntl[3]` is greater than or equal to 2 with `c` being decremented by 1. If `c` is not zero, the condition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
