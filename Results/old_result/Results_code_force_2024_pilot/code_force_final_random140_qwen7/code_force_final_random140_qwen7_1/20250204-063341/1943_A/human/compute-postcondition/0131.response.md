Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies that `i` is an element of `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is an element of `a`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `a`.
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be another element `i` in `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `a` must have at least one element, and `i` is an element of `a`, for the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least two elements (so that there is another element `i` to iterate over).
   - `cntl[i]` will be incremented by 1 for the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` must have at least two elements, and `cntl[i]` will be incremented by 1 for the new value of `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` must have at least two elements, and `i` is an element of `a`**
