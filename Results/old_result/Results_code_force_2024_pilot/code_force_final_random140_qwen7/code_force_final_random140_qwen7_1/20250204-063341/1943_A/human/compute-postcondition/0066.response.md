Output State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1**.

In this case, the code increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `cntl[i]` before the increment, we only know that its value has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
