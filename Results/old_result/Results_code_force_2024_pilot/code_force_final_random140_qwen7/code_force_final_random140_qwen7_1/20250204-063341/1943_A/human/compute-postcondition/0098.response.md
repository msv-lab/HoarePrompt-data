Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `cntl[2]` is not less than 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is not broken.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 1. The conditions involving `n` and `cntl[2]` remain unchanged as no code affects these variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `j` and retains the original conditions for `n` and `cntl[2]`.
