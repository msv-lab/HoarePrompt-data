Output State: All elements in `cntl` are increased by 3.

Explanation: Given that the loop runs for each element in `a`, and since `a` has at least `n` elements (as `n` is at least 4), each element in `cntl` will be incremented once for each corresponding index in `a`. Since the loop runs for all iterations, each `cntl[i]` will be incremented by 3 (1 increment per iteration, and the loop runs 3 times as per the given states). This pattern would continue until all iterations are completed, resulting in each `cntl[i]` being increased by 3.
