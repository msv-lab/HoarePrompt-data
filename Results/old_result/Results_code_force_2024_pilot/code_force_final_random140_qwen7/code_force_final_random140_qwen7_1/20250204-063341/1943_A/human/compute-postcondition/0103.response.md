Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `cntl[2]` is not less than 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is not broken. If `cntl[j] == 0`, then `j` becomes 2 and `n` remains greater than or equal to 1. If the condition `not c` is true in the else part, then `j` becomes 1 and `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
