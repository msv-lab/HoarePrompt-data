Output State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `a` must have at least one element, and `i` is an element of `a`**.

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `i` is already an element of `a` and `a` must have at least one element, these conditions remain unchanged. Only `cntl[i]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value.
