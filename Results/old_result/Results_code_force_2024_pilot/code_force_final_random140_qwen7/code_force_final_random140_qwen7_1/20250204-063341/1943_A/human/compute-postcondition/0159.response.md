Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - Either `cntl[j]` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 2 and `c` is `c - 1`.
   - If `c` is 0, the current value of `c` remains `c - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - The condition `n` is greater than 0 still holds true as it did not change during the previous iteration.
   - The postcondition for the loop body needs to be considered. If `cntl[j]` was 0 and the loop was exited, then `cntl[2]` will determine the behavior. If `cntl[2]` is 0, the loop will exit. If `cntl[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `c` will be `c - 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
   - The postcondition for `cntl[2]` needs to be considered. If `cntl[2]` is 0, the loop will exit. If `cntl[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` will be `c - 1`.

Given these points, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and either `cntl[2]` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or `cntl[2]` is greater than or equal to 2 and `c` is `c - 1`.**
