Output State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The value of `i` remains the same as it is the next element in the iterable `a`. The initial conditions of `cntl[i]` being incremented by 1 and `i` being the next element in the iterable `a` are still valid after the code execution.
