Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `cntl[j]` is at least 1, `c` is `cntl[j] - 1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `cntl[j]`, or `c`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of an implied loop or conditional structure.
