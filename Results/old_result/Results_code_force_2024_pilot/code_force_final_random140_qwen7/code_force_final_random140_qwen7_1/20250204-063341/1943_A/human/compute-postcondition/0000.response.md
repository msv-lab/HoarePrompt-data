Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. However, since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any specific value, we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: Since `_` is just a placeholder, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a valid integer. The key is to ensure that `int(input())` provides a valid input that allows the loop to run.

3. **Understand the constraints**: The problem states that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). This means that `int(input())` should return an integer within this range.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is within the specified range for `t`.

**State after adjustment**:
- The input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input to `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^4\)**.
