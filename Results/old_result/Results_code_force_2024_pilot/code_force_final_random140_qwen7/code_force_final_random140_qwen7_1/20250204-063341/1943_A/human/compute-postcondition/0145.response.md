Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `cntl[j]` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. In this case, since there is no loop or switch statement mentioned, it implies that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `j`, `n`, and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged.
