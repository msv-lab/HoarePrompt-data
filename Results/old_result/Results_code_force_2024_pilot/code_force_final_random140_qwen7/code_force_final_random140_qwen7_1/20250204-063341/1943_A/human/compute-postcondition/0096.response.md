Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly set to 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but this does not affect the value of `j`.
- The condition involving `cntl[2]` (either it is less than 2 or not) and whether the most internal loop or if statement is broken or not does not change the value of `j`.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
