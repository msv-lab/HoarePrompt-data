Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `cntl[j]` is at least 2, and `c` is `cntl[j] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `cntl[j]` is at least 2, after decrementing `c` by 1, `c` will be `cntl[j] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
