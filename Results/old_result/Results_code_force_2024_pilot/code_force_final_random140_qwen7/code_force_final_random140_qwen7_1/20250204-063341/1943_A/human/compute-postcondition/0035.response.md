Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `j` starts from 1, it will increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and the value of `cntl[j]` is at least 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is at least 2, then `c` is `cntl[j] - 1`. If `c` is not zero, the program continues without changing the values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[j]`, and `c`. If `c` is zero, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
