Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is decreased by 1.**

The initial state of `j` is 2 if it was 1, otherwise 1, which means `j` is 2. The initial state of `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which remains unchanged. The line `c -= 1` decreases the value of `c` by 1, but since the initial value of `c` is not specified, we only know that `c` has been decreased by 1.
