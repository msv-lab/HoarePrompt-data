Output State: **The value of `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is 0, and `cntl[1]` and `cntl[2]` are both greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be 2 because the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n`. The loop breaks when `c` becomes 0, which happens after the second iteration since `c` starts at 2 and is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs. Therefore, `c` will be 0 after the third iteration. Since the loop breaks when `cntl[j] < 2`, and given that `j` reaches 2, `cntl[2]` must be checked and found to be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue until `c` is 0. Similarly, `cntl[1]` must also be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to proceed as expected.
