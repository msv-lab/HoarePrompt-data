Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `cntl[2]` is either 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or `cntl[2]` is greater than or equal to 2 and `c` is `c - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 2. The condition that `n` is greater than 0 also remains unchanged. For `cntl[2]`, the condition either stays as 0 with the most internal loop or if statement being broken out of, or it remains greater than or equal to 2 with `c` being decremented by 1.
