Output State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 2, `i` is 2 more than the previous value and must be within the bounds of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increases the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `i` was previously 1 more than its previous value, now `i` is 2 more than its previous value. The bounds of `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1 (from the initial state) and `i` is now 2 more than its previous value.
