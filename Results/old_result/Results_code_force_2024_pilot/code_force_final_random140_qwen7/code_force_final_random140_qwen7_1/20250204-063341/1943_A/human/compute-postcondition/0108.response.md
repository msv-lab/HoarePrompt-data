Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 2 if it was 1, otherwise 1. This means that `j` is set to 2 because the condition states "if it was 1, otherwise 1," implying that `j` is 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the `print(j)` statement.

Therefore, when the `print(j)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
