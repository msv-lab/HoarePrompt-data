Output State: **`cntl` is a list of n+1 elements, all initialized to 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20000.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cntl` with `n+1` elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `a` retains its original state as a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
