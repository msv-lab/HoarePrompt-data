Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and if `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 0, the condition `cntl[2]` being either 0 (indicating the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of) or greater than or equal to 2 with `c` being `c - 1` remains unchanged.
