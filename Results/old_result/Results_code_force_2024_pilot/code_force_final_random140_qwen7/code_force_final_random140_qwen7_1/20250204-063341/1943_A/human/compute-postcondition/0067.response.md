Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The key variables here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is that `cntl[i]` is increased by 1. This means that the value of `cntl[i]` has been updated.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the variable `i` must be within the range defined by `a`. Since the loop is iterating over each element in `a`, the condition for the next iteration is simply that there is an `i` in `a` such that the loop can continue.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented (or otherwise modified) as part of the loop body, but the exact value of `i` is not specified. However, since the loop is iterating over `a`, the next value of `i` must still be within the bounds of `a`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can continue with the next value of `i` being within the bounds of `a`.

**State:**
- `cntl[i]` is increased by 1 (this state is already given and does not need to be explicitly stated in the answer).
- `i` must be within the bounds of `a` for the loop to execute again.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only ensure that `i` is within the bounds of `a` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration is:
State: **`i` must be within the bounds of `a`**
