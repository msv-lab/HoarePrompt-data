Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is at least 2, meaning `cntl[2]` has a value of at least 2.

Given these conditions, let's break down the logic:

1. Since `cntl[j]` is at least 2, the value of `c` is calculated as `cntl[j] - 1`. Therefore, `c` will be at least 1 (since `cntl[j]` is at least 2).
2. As `c` is not zero, the program continues without changing the values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[j]`, and `c`.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `j`, which is explicitly given as 2.

Output: **2**
