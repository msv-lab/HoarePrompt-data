Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 20000.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration, but its initial value before the loop starts is not specified and doesn't affect the loop's ability to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
