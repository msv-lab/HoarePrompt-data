Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is executed, it means we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify these variables. The condition regarding `cntl[2]` being either 0 or greater than or equal to 2 with `c` being `c - 1` is no longer relevant after the `break` statement is executed.
