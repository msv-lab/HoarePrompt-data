The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. It calculates the frequency of each number in the list \( a \) and determines the smallest index \( j \) (from 1 to \( n \)) that appears fewer than twice in the list. If no such index exists, it prints 0. If the number 0 does not appear in the list, it directly prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the smallest index of 0 if it appears fewer than twice, or the smallest index of any other number that appears fewer than twice.
