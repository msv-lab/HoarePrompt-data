Based on the initial state provided:

- `cntl[i]` for each index `i` in the list will be equal to the frequency of occurrence of `i` in the list `a`.
- After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` will contain how many times each integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- `cntl[0]` is explicitly stated to be 0.

The print statement simply outputs the value `0`.

Output: **0**
