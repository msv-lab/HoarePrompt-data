Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `cntl[j]` was being checked and updated. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the break indicates that the execution exits the current loop or conditional structure.
