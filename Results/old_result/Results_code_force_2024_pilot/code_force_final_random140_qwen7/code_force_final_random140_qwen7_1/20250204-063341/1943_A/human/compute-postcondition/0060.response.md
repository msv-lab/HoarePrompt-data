Postcondition: **`cntl[i]` for each index `i` in the list will be equal to the frequency of occurrence of `i` in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `j` is 4, `n` is at least 4, and `cntl[j]` is at least 2 for all `j` from 1 to `n`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `cntl[i]` will contain how many times each integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then the additional conditions are met where `j` is 4, `n` is at least 4, and `cntl[j]` is at least 2 for all `j` from 1 to `n`.
