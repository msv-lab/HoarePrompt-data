Postcondition: **All elements in `cntl` are incremented by the number of times each corresponding index appears in the list `a`, and `a` must contain at least three distinct elements. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `a` is processed normally. Otherwise, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and either `cntl[3]` is 0 indicating the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or `cntl[3]` is greater than or equal to 2 with `c` being decremented by 1. If `c` is not zero, the condition remains unchanged.**
