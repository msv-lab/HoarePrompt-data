Output State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The variable `i` remains the next element in the iterable `a`. Therefore, the updated state includes that `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1 while `i` still refers to the next element in the iterable `a`.
