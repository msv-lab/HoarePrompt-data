Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 2, the current value of `c` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or block. In this case, since there is no loop or block context provided, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `j`, `n`, and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged, and `c` remains 0.
