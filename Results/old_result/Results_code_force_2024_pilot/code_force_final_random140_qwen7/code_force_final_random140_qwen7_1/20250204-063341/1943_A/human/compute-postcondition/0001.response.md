Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20000.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user, which must be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^4\) (20000), and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged, adhering to the initial conditions.
