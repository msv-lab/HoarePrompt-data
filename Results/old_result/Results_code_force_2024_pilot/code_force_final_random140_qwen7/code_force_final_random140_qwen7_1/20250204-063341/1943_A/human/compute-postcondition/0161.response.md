Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the fact that either `cntl[2]` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or `cntl[2]` is greater than or equal to 2 and `c` is `c - 1` remains true.
