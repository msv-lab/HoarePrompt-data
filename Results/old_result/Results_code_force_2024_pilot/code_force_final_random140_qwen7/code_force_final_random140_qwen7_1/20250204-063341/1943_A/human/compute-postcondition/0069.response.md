Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The key variables here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
   - `i` must be within the bounds of `a` for the next iteration.

3. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - Since `i` must be within the bounds of `a` for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 (assuming `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration).
   - The condition `i` must be within the bounds of `a` means `i` should be less than the length of `a`. Therefore, `i` should be set to the next valid index within the bounds of `a`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `cntl[i]` is increased by 1 in the previous iteration.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to check the next element in `a`.
- `i` must still be within the bounds of `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be within the bounds of `a`**. 

To be more precise, if `i` was the last valid index before the increase, then `i` should now be the next index within the bounds of `a`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1 more than the previous value and must be within the bounds of `a`**.
