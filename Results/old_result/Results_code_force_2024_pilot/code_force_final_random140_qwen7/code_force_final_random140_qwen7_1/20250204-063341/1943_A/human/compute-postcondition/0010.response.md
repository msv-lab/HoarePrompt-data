Output State: The value of `cntl[i]` for each index `i` in the list will be equal to the frequency of `i` appearing in the list `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` will hold how many times each integer `i` from the list `a` was encountered.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `cntl` list will show the count of each integer present in the original list `a`.
