Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides us with the following information:
   - `j` is explicitly stated to be 3.
   - `n` is greater than 0, but this does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `cntl[2]` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 2, and `c` is `c - 1`. However, since `c` is not used in the print statement and the value of `cntl[2]` does not influence the print statement, these details do not change the outcome of the print statement.

2. The print statement is simply `print(j)`, which will output the value of `j`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the value of `j`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
