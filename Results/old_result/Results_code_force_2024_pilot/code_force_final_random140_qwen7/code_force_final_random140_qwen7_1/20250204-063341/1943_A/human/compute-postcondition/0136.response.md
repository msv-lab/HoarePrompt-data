Based on the initial state provided:

- `cntl` is a list where each element is incremented by the number of times its corresponding index appears in the list `a`.
- `a` must contain at least three distinct elements.
- Currently, `cntl[0]` is equal to 0.

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
