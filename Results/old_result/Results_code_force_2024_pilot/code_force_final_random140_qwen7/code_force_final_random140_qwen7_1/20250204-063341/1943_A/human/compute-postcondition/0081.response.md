Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` is mentioned to be greater than or equal to 1 but does not affect the output of the `print(j)` statement.
- `cntl[j]` is explicitly stated to have a current value of 0, but this variable is not printed in the given code snippet.

The code snippet only contains a `print(j)` statement, which will print the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
