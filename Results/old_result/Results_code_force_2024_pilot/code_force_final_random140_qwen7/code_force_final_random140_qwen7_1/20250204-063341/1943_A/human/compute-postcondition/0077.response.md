Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` equal to 1 (since `range(1, n + 1)` generates values from 1 to `n`).
3. **Determine the value of `n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is less than 1, the range function will generate no values, and the loop will not execute.
4. **Other variables**: The other variables mentioned (`cntl` and `c`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

- `j` should be set to 1 because the loop starts with `j` equal to 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
