Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - This means `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `cntl[j]` is at least 1.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.
   - Given `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` will be 3.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` (which will be 3) must still be less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain a positive integer and must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

7. **Final state**:
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 3.

Given this analysis, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**.
