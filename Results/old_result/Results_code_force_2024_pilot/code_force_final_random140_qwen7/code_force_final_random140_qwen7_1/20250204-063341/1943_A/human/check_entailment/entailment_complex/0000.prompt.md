Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list a contains n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    if cntl[j] == 0:
                        print(j)
                        break
                    else:
                        c -= 1
                        if not c:
                            print(j)
                            break
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `cntl` will be a list where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the frequency of occurrence of `i` in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means there are no zeros in the list `a`. Otherwise, `cntl[0]` will be the count of zeros in `a`. The variable `c` will be 0 if `cntl[0]` is 0, otherwise, it will be the minimum of 2 and the count of zeros in `a`. The loop will print the smallest index `j` (from 1 to `n`) that has a count less than 2, or it will print 0 if all indices from 1 to `n` have a count of at least 2.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `cntl` will be updated to reflect the frequency of each element in `a`.
    #- If `cntl[0]` is 0, the loop will print 0.
    #- If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the loop will find the smallest index `j` (from 1 to `n`) with a count less than 2 and print it. If no such index exists, it will print the smallest index with a count of exactly 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. It calculates the frequency of each number in the list \( a \) and determines the smallest index \( j \) (from 1 to \( n \)) that appears fewer than twice in the list. If no such index exists, it prints 0. If the number 0 does not appear in the list, it directly prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the smallest index of 0 if it appears fewer than twice, or the smallest index of any other number that appears fewer than twice.
