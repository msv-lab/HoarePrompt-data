Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is 4, `n` is at least 4, and `cntl[j]` is at least 2 for all `j` from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be incremented to the next available index where `cntl[j]` is at least 2. Given that the loop has already executed up to the third iteration, `j` would have been set to 3 in the last iteration. For the loop to continue, there must be an index `j` (from 1 to `n`) where `cntl[j]` is at least 2, and since the loop has not broken out, `j` will be incremented to 4. Therefore, `j` will be 4, and `n` must be at least 4 to allow for this iteration. All other elements in `cntl` remain unchanged as per the loop's conditions.
