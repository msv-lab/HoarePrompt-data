Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `cntl[j]` is at least 2, and the current value of `c` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `cntl[j]`, and `c`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
