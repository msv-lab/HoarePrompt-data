Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `cntl[2]` is 0 or `cntl[2]` is greater than or equal to 2 with `c` being `c - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions for `j`, `n`, and `cntl[2]` remain unchanged. If `cntl[2]` was 0 before the decrement, it remains 0. If `cntl[2]` was greater than or equal to 2, it now becomes `c - 1`, but since `c` was already `cntl[2]`, it effectively becomes `cntl[2] - 1`. The values of `j` and `n` are not affected by this operation.
