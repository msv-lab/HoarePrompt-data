Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that all elements in the list `cntl` are incremented by 3. However, it specifically mentions that the current value of `cntl[0]` is 0 before any incrementation takes place.
2. Since the initial value of `cntl[0]` is 0, and no other information about the other elements is provided, we can assume the list `cntl` looks like this before any changes: `cntl = [0, ..., ...]`.
3. The print statement simply prints the number 0.

Given this reasoning, the output will be:

Output: **0**
