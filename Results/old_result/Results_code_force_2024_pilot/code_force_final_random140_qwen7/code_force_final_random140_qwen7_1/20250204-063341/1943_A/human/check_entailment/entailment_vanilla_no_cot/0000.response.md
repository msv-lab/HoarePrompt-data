Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of both players. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Alice's and Bob's Strategies**: 
   - Alice can always pick elements to ensure that the MEX of her resulting array `c` is maximized.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX by picking elements that prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Elements**:
   - The current implementation only considers the counts of elements in `a` and does not account for the optimal moves by both players.
   - It incorrectly assumes that the first non-zero count in `cntl` (the count array) will give the MEX, which is not always true.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle cases where Alice can force a specific MEX value through strategic picking, especially when there are duplicate elements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game considering the optimal moves of both players. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count occurrences of each element
        cnt = [0] * n
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        
        # Determine the optimal MEX
        mex = 0
        while mex < n and cnt[mex] >= (1 + (mex % 2)):
            mex += 1
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Count Occurrences**: We count how many times each element appears in the array `a`.
- **Determine Optimal MEX**: We iterate to find the smallest non-negative integer `mex` that cannot be achieved by either player given their optimal strategies. This involves checking if the count of each number up to `mex` allows either player to prevent the other from achieving a higher MEX.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and the final MEX is correctly determined.
