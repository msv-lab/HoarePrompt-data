Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is now 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since `cntl[j]` was decremented by 1 and became 0, and the condition `not c` is true, the `break` statement will cause the program to exit the loop or conditional block. The values of `j`, `n`, and the current value of `cntl[j]` are updated accordingly, and the other conditions remain unchanged.
