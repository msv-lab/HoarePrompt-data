Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to decode an encoded string according to the specified algorithm.
3. `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the `encoded` string.
4. `r` is constructed by joining these unique characters in sorted order.
5. A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `r` to its corresponding character from the end of `r`.
6. The `decoded` string is generated by replacing each character in the `encoded` string with the mapped character from `char_map`.
7. The logic for constructing `r` and the mapping in `char_map` is correct and aligns with the encoding process described.
8. The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem description and the provided state comments.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct in performing the decoding as per the specified algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
