Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the input data and processes each test case.
2. The `func_1` function is responsible for decoding the string. It first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the `encoded` string.
3. It then creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in the unique list is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the list.
4. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the `encoded` string by replacing each character according to the mapping.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct logic for decoding the string. The function `func_1` correctly implements the steps required to decode the string based on the provided rules.

Correctness: **True**
