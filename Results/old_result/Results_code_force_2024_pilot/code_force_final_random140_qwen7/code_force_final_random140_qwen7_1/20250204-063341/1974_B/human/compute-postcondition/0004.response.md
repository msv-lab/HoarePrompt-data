Output State: **The program returns a string `decoded` where each character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by the corresponding character from the end of the string `r`.**

This means that for each character in `encoded`, the program uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding character from the end of `r` and constructs the `decoded` string accordingly.
