### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Splitting Data**: The input is split into parts using `split()`, and the number of test cases (`t`) and other necessary data are extracted correctly.
3. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program extracts the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string itself (`encoded`).
4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It calculates the string `r` containing all unique characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`.
   - **Decoding**: It uses the `char_map` to decode the encoded string by replacing each character according to the mapping.
5. **Output**: The decoded strings for all test cases are collected in a list and printed out.

### Verification:
- The logic for creating the auxiliary string `r` and the character mapping is correct.
- The decoding process correctly reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement.
- The function handles all test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
