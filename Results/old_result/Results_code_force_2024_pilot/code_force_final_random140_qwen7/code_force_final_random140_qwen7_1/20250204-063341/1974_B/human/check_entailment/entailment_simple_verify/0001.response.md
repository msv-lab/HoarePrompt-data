### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Splitting Data**: The input is split into parts using `split()`, and the number of test cases (`t`) and other necessary data are extracted correctly.
3. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program extracts the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string itself (`encoded`).
4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It calculates the string `r` containing all unique characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`.
   - **Decoding**: It uses the `char_map` to decode the encoded string by replacing each character according to the mapping.
5. **Output**: The decoded strings for all test cases are collected in a list and printed out.

### Verification:

- The logic for creating the auxiliary string `r` and the character mapping is correct.
- The decoding process correctly reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement.
- The function handles all test cases as required.

However, there is a subtle issue with the way the `char_map` is constructed. Specifically, the `char_map` should map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart, but the current implementation incorrectly maps each character in `r` to the character at position `len(r) - 1 - i`. This means that the mapping is not correctly reversed.

For example, consider the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`:
- The unique characters in sorted order are `"cdefors"`.
- The symmetric mapping should be:
  - `'c'` -> `'c'`
  - `'d'` -> `'s'`
  - `'e'` -> `'r'`
  - `'f'` -> `'o'`
  - `'o'` -> `'f'`
  - `'r'` -> `'e'`
  - `'s'` -> `'d'`

But the current implementation would create:
- `'c'` -> `'s'`
- `'d'` -> `'o'`
- `'e'` -> `'r'`
- `'f'` -> `'f'`
- `'o'` -> `'d'`
- `'r'` -> `'e'`
- `'s'` -> `'c'`

This incorrect mapping leads to the wrong decoded string.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    encoded = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(encoded))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    char_map = {char: r[len(r) - 1 - i] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the `char_map` construction was incorrect. The corrected implementation ensures that each character in `r` is correctly mapped to its symmetric counterpart.

Final: **False**
