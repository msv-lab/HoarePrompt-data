Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` sorted in ascending order; `r` is a string which is the concatenation of all characters in `unique_chars`; `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each character in `r` to the corresponding character from the end of `r`.**

Explanation: The code creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the string `r` (which is the concatenation of all unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order) is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `r`. For example, if `r` is "abc", `char_map` would be {'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}. The lengths and contents of `encoded` and `unique_chars` remain unchanged.
