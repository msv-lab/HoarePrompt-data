### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Splitting Data**: The input is split into parts using `split()`, and the number of test cases (`t`) and other necessary data are extracted correctly.
3. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program extracts the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string itself (`encoded`).
4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It calculates the string `r` containing all unique characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`.
   - **Decoding**: It uses the `char_map` to decode the encoded string by replacing each character according to the mapping.

Given the function summary, we can verify the following points:

- The function `func_1` correctly generates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the input string.
- The character mapping is correctly created by mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart from the end of `r`.
- The decoding process is performed correctly by using the `char_map`.

Let's break down the function step-by-step with the provided function summary:

1. **Unique Characters**: 
   ```python
   unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
   r = ''.join(unique_chars)
   ```
   This step correctly generates the string `r` containing all unique characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.

2. **Character Mapping**:
   ```python
   char_map = {char: r[-i - 1] for (i, char) in enumerate(r)}
   ```
   This step correctly creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`.

3. **Decoding**:
   ```python
   decoded = ''.join((char_map[char] for char in encoded))
   ```
   This step correctly decodes the encoded string by replacing each character according to the `char_map`.

Given the function summary and the detailed breakdown, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

### Verification:
- The logic for creating the auxiliary string `r` and the character mapping is correct.
- The decoding process correctly reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement.
- The function handles all test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
