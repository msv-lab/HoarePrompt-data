Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 3 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the string `a` starting at index `i` (which is 3) and having a length of 3. The values of `i`, `t`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged except for the creation of the new variable `s`. The condition for `ans` remains the same, now applied to the substring `s`.
