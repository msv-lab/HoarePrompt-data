Output State: **`ans` is either 2 or 3, `i` is equal to `i + 3`, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 3` to `i`, `s` is set to either 'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie'**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was initially either 1 or 0, it now becomes either 2 or 3. The values of `i`, `s`, and their relationships remain unchanged.
