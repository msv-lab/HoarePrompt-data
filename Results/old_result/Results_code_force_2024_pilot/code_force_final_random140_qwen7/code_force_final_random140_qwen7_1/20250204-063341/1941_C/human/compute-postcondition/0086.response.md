Output State: **`ans` is either 2 or 1, `i` is either 6 or 4, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `s` is set to either 'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie'**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was either 1 or 0 initially, it now becomes either 2 (if it was 1) or 1 (if it was 0). The values of `i`, `s`, and the condition about `s` remain unchanged.
