Output State: **`i` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `ans` is 2, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, so if its initial value was 1, it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
