Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 0, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 4 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 1 otherwise. After incrementing, `i` becomes 4 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 2 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
