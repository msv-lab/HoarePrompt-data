Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is a placeholder used to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. This means the input itself needs to be considered. Since the loop will run for each test case, the number of iterations is determined by the user input.

3. **Consider the constraints**: The problem states that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the loop will execute between 1 and \(10^4\) times.

4. **Adjust the initial state**: The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that the input matches this constraint.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
