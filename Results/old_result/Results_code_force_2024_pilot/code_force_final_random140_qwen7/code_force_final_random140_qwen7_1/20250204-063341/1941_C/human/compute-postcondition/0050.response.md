Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1.
- `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3.

The key point here is the value of `s`. Since `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3, it must be either 'map' or 'pie' for `ans` to be 1. If `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `ans` would be 0, but the question does not specify any other value for `s`, so we assume `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.

Given this, the print statement `print(s)` will output the substring `s`.

Output: **s (where s is either 'map' or 'pie')**
