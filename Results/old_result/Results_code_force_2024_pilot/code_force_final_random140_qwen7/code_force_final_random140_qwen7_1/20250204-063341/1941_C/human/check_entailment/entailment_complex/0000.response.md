Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string and counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks substrings of length 3 ("map" and "pie") but does not ensure that it removes the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie".

To make the string beautiful, we need to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings. The current implementation does not achieve this goal. Here's why the provided solution is incorrect:

1. The program only checks for "map" and "pie" substrings of length 3 and increments the index by 3 each time one is found. This means it skips over other possible ways to remove characters to make the string beautiful.
2. The program does not account for overlapping or nested substrings. For example, in the string "mapmap", the program would count two occurrences of "map" but would not remove the minimum number of characters to make it beautiful.
3. The program does not handle cases where the string contains both "map" and "pie" efficiently.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
