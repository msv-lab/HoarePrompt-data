Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the substring `a[0:3]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` assigns a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3 to the variable `s`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, `s` becomes the substring `a[0:3]`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.
