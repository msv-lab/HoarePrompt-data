Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input string and len(a) must be greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, and `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1.
