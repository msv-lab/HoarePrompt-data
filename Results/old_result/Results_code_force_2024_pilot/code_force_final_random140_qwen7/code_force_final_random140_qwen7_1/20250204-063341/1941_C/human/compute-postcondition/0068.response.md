Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the total number of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is the last index `i` where the condition was met plus 3, or it is `len(a)` if no more valid substrings are found, `s` is the last valid substring of length 3 checked during the loop, which could be 'map', 'pie', or any other 3-character substring depending on the input `a`, `a` is now the input string provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since `a` was initially an integer, now it becomes a string containing the input provided by the user. All other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values.
