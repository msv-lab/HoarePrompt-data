Output State: **`i` is 7, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 6, `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3, `s` is assigned the value of the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 6 to 7. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
