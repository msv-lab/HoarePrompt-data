Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 0 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` slices the string `a` starting from index `i` (which is 0) and takes a substring of length 3. This substring is assigned to the variable `s`. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
