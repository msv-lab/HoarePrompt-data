Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is either 4 or 2, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `s` is set to either 'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie'**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 3 or 1 initially, after the increment, `i` will be either 4 (if `i` was 3) or 2 (if `i` was 1). The values of `ans`, `s`, and the substring condition remain unchanged.
