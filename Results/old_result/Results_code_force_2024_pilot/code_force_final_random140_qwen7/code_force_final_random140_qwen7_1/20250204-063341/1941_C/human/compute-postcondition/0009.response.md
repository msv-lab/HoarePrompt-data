Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input string and len(a) must be greater than 2, `ans` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 0 and having length 3, and the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'**.

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 0, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
