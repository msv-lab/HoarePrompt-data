Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 0, `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1, `i` is 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 4, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 0 otherwise, after executing the code, `ans` will be 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 1 otherwise. The values of `a`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
