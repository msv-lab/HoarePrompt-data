The value of `i` is incremented by 3, so `i` becomes 9. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 6, `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3.
