Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is either 6 or 4, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `s` is set to either 'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie'**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Given that `i` was initially either 3 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be either 6 (if `i` was 3) or 4 (if `i` was 1). The values of `ans`, `s`, and the condition for `s` remain unchanged.
