You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters and has length n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            print(s)
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute until `i` reaches `len(a) - 2`. After all iterations, the following will be true:
    #
    #- `a` remains the original input string.
    #- `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
    #- `ans` is the total count of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie'.
    #- `i` is set to `len(a) - 2` because the loop increments `i` by 1 or 3 each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `len(a) - 2`.
    #
    #In summary, `ans` will contain the total number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the input string `a`, and `i` will be the index just after the last valid substring of length 3 that was checked.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6). The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given `t` and `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
