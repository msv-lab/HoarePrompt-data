Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 0, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 4, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 3. If the substring `s` was originally 'map' or 'pie', then `i` was set to 3, and now it becomes 6. If `s` was not 'map' or 'pie', then `i` was set to 1, and now it becomes 4. The values of `a`, `ans`, and `s` remain unchanged.
