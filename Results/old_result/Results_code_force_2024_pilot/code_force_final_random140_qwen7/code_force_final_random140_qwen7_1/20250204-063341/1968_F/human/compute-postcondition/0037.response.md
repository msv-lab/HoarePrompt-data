Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`. If `x[l - 1]` equals `x[r]`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x[l - 1]` does not equal `x[r]`, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no further action specified in the else part.**
