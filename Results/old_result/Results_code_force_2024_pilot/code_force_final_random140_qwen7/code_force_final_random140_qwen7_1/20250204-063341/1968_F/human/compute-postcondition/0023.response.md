Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is `n`, `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1` to the variable `lower`. Since `inds`, `x`, `r`, and `l` are already defined from the initial state, `lower` will be calculated based on these values. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
