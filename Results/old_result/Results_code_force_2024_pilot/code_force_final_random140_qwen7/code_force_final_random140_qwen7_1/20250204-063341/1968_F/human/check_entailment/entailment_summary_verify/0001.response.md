### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1`: This function takes a cast function as an argument and applies it to each element in the input string split by spaces. It returns a map object, which needs to be converted to a list or tuple.
   - `func_2`: This function performs a binary search to find the first index where the predicate is true. If no such index exists, it returns `None`.

2. **Main Function (`func_3`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Reads `n` and `q`, the size of the array and the number of queries.
     - Reads the array `a` and computes the prefix XOR array `x`.
     - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices of each unique prefix XOR value.
     - For each query, checks if the prefix XOR from `l-1` to `r` is zero, which would mean the subarray is interesting.
     - If not, uses binary search to find the appropriate indices for splitting the subarray to check if it can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is sound. The use of prefix XOR and binary search is appropriate for finding the required splits.
   - However, there are a few issues in the implementation that need to be addressed:
     - The function `func_1` returns a map object, which is not directly usable. It should be converted to a list or tuple before further processing.
     - The binary search function `func_2` is used to find the appropriate indices for splitting the subarray, but the logic for determining the correct split points is flawed. Specifically, the indices found by `func_2` may not necessarily lead to a valid split of the subarray into parts with equal XOR values.
     - The main logic for checking the subarray's interesting property is based on the assumption that if the prefix XOR from `l-1` to `r` is zero, the subarray is interesting. This is not always true, as demonstrated by the examples provided in the problem statement.

### Example Analysis:
Consider the following example from the problem statement:
- Input:
  ```
  5 5
  1 1 2 3 0
  1 5
  2 4
  3 5
  1 3
  3 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  YES
  NO
  NO
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The provided code will incorrectly output `NO` for the first query because it fails to correctly identify the valid split points using the binary search function.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the implementation of the binary search function `func_2` and the logic for determining the split points are flawed. The provided code does not correctly handle all cases where a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
