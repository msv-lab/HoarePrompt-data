Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` is `n`.
- `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`.
- `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`.

The conditions given are:
- `upper > lower` is true.
- `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`.
- `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This print statement will output the string 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
