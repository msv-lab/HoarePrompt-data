### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1`: This function takes a cast function as an argument and applies it to each element in the input string split by spaces. It returns a map object, which needs to be converted to a list or tuple.
   - `func_2`: This function performs a binary search to find the first index where the predicate is true. If no such index exists, it returns `None`.

2. **Main Function (`func_3`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Reads `n` and `q`, the size of the array and the number of queries.
     - Reads the array `a` and computes the prefix XOR array `x`.
     - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices of each unique prefix XOR value.
     - For each query, checks if the prefix XOR from `l-1` to `r` is zero, which would mean the subarray is interesting.
     - If not, uses binary search to find the appropriate indices for splitting the subarray to check if it can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is sound. The use of prefix XOR and binary search is appropriate for finding the required splits.
   - The code correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the program's behavior, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The program does not correctly handle the condition where the subarray is interesting. Specifically, the logic for determining if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values is flawed. The binary search approach used in `func_2` does not guarantee that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The program incorrectly assumes that if `lower` and `upper` are found, the subarray is interesting, which is not always true.

- **Example Analysis**:
  - Consider the example where `a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` and the query is for the subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]`. The prefix XOR array `x` is `[0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0]`. The subarray is interesting because it can be split as `[1], [1], [2, 3, 0]` with XOR values `1, 1, 1` respectively. However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for this query.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the subarray itself is already a single element or when the subarray has a length of 2. These cases need special handling to ensure correctness.

Given these issues, the original assessment is inaccurate.
