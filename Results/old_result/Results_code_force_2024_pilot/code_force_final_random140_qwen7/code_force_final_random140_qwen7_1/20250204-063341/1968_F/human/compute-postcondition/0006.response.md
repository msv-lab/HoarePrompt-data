Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with default list type, `inds[0]` contains the element `[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each element \(a_i\) is in the range \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\) and must contain at least one element, `x` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the XOR of the first element (which is 0) and 0, making the second element also 0.**

In simpler terms: `inds` remains unchanged, `n` and `q` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `x` is now a list containing `[0, 0]`.
