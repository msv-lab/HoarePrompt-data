Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is the result of `inds[x[r]][inds[x[r]][lower + 1]]` or -1 if the condition is not met. If `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `l <= lower <= r`, then no change is made. Otherwise, no change is made.**
