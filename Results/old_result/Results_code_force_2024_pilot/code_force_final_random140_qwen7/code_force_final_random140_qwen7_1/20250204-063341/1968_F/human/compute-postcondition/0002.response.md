Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of integers where each element a_i is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30; `x` is a list containing a single element 0.**

The code initializes a new list `x` with a single element, which is `0`. The values of `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
