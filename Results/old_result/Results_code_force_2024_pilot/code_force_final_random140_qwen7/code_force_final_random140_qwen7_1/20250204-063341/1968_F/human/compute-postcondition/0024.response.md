Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is `n`, `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` or -1.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `upper` by calling `func_2` with `inds[x[l - 1]]` as the first argument and a lambda function as the second argument. The lambda function checks if `arg` is less than or equal to `r`. The values of `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `lower` remain unchanged from their initial states.
