Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r) or -1`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `lower` to `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. Since the initial value of `lower` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value after this operation. However, we know that `lower` is now updated to the element at index `lower + 1` of the list `inds[x[r]]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
