Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `inds[0]` now contains the element from index 1 to the total length of `x`, `x` is a list where the first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `a`.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `inds[0]` will contain a list of indices starting from 1 up to the length of `x`. This is because every time the loop runs, it appends the current index (which is the length of `x` minus one) to `inds[0]`. The list `x` will contain `n` elements, where the first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of all previously seen elements in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
    upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
    lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
    if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `q` is `n`, `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper > lower` and `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, then these conditions hold. Otherwise, either `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, or `l` is greater than `upper`, or `upper` is greater than `r`, or `lower` is greater than `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper` is greater than `lower` and both `l` and `lower` are within the range defined by `l` and `r`, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is the result of `inds[x[r]][inds[x[r]][lower + 1]]` or -1 if the condition is not met. If `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `l <= lower <= r`, then no change is made. Otherwise, no change is made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
