Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1`**.

This means that the variable `lower` is assigned the result of calling `func_2` with two arguments: `inds[x[r]]` and a lambda function that checks if `arg` is less than `l`. If the result of `func_2` is `False`, then `-1` is assigned to `lower`. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
