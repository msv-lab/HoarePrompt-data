Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < q`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `q` is `n`
   - `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`
   - `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`

4. **Check the loop continuation condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `q`. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `q` is `n`, the loop will continue if `n > 1`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i = 2`.
   - `q` remains `n`.
   - The values of `l`, `r`, `upper`, and `lower` do not change based on the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`**
