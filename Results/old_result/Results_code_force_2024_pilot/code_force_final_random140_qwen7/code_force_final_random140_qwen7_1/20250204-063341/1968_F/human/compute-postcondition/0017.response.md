Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is `n`, `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` was called with an integer argument (the value of `int`), and it returned two values which were assigned to `l` and `r`. The values of `i` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
