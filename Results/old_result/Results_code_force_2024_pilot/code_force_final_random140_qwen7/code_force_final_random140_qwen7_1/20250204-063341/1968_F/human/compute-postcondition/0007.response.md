Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with default list type, `inds[0]` contains the element `[1]`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each element \(a_i\) is in the range \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\) and must contain at least one element, `x` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the XOR of the first element (which is 0) and 0, making the second element also 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the index of the last element in the list `x` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Initially, `x` is `[0, 0]` because the second element is the XOR of the first element (0) with itself, which is 0. The length of `x` is 2, so `len(x) - 1` is 1. Since `x[-1]` is 0, `inds[0]` is updated to include the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
