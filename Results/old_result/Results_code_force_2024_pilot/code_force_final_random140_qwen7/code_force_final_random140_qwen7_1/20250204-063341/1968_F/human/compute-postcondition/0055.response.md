Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `q` is `n`.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`.
- `lower` is the result of `inds[x[r]][inds[x[r]][lower + 1]]` or -1 if the condition is not met.

The print statement is simply `print('Yes')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'` without referencing any of the variables or objects whose values are not explicitly provided, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
