Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `inds` is a defaultdict with default list type, `inds[0]` contains the element `[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of integers where each element a_i is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30; `x` is a list containing a single element 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `inds` is a defaultdict with default list type, `inds[0]` contains the element `[1]`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each element \(a_i\) is in the range \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\) and must contain at least one element, `x` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the XOR of the first element (which is 0) and 0, making the second element also 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `inds[0]` now contains the element `[1, 2]`, `x` is a list containing three elements where the second element is 0 and the third element is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `inds[0]` now contains the element `[1, 2, 3]`, `x` is a list containing three elements where the second element is 0, the third element is 1, and the fourth element is the result of `1 ^ i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
