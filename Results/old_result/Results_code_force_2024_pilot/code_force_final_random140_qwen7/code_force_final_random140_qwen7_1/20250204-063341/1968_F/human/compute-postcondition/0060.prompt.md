You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, q) are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all 1 <= i <= n. l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query.
def func_3():
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `inds[0]` now contains the element from index 1 to the total length of `x`, `x` is a list where the first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `a`.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `inds[0]` will contain a list of indices starting from 1 up to the length of `x`. This is because every time the loop runs, it appends the current index (which is the length of `x` minus one) to `inds[0]`. The list `x` will contain `n` elements, where the first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of all previously seen elements in the list `a`.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `q-1`, `q` remains unchanged, `l` and `r` will be the last return values of `func_1(int)` for the respective iterations, `upper` will be `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, and `lower` will be `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `l <= lower <= r`, the conditions will hold. Otherwise, the conditions will not hold.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `a` of integers, two positive integers `l` and `r`, and two positive integers `n` and `q`. It performs `q` queries, each defined by `l` and `r`, and returns the results of these queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
