Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]` and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values but instead moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
