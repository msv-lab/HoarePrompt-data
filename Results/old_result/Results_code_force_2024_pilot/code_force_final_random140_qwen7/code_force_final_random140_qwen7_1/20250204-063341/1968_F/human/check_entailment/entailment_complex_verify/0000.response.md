### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code and the provided problem description to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Subarray Length Check**: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not check if the subarray length is at least 3. This is crucial because the problem definition states that the subarray must be split into \(k > 1\) parts, meaning the subarray must have at least 3 elements.
   
2. **XOR Calculation and Storage**: The program correctly calculates the cumulative XOR values and stores them in the dictionary `inds`. This part of the code is correct and ensures that we can efficiently find the required indices.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search function `func_2` is implemented correctly. It finds the smallest index in the list that satisfies the predicate, ensuring efficient querying.

4. **Query Handling**: The main logic for handling queries is correct. It uses the precomputed XOR values and indices to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

However, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program does not handle the case where the subarray length is less than 3. This oversight leads to incorrect results for subarrays with fewer than 3 elements.

#### Example Verification:
Consider the input:
- Array: `[1, 1]`
- Query: `1 2`

The subarray `[1, 1]` should not be considered interesting because it cannot be divided into more than one part. However, the current implementation will incorrectly return "YES" for this query.

To fix this, we need to add a check at the beginning of the function `func_3` to ensure the subarray has at least 3 elements before proceeding with the rest of the logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to handle the case where the subarray length is less than 3, leading to incorrect results for such subarrays.

**Final: False**
