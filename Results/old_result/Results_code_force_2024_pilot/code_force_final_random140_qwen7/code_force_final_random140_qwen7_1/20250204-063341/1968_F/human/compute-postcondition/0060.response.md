Functionality: **The function processes a list `a` of integers and handles `q` queries. For each query defined by `l` and `r`, it checks if there exists an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the cumulative XOR of elements from the start of the list `a` to `i` is zero. If such an index exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries.**
