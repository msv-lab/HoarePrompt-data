Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)`, `lower` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or -1 if the condition is not met.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `upper` to the result of `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)`. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, `inds`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `upper` depends on the result of `func_2` applied to `inds[x[l - 1]]` with the condition `arg <= r`. The value of `lower` remains as it was previously defined, which is the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or -1 if the condition is not met.
