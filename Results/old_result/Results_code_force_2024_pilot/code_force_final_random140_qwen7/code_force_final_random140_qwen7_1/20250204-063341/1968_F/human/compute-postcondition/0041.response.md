Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `upper` by assigning `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]` to it. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
