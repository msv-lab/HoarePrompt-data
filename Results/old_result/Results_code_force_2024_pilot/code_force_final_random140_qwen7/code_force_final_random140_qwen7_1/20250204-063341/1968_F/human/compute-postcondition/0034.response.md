Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `int`. Since `int` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an integer value passed to the function. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `l` and `r` respectively. The values of `i` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
