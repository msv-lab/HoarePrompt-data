Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is the result of `inds[x[r]][inds[x[r]][lower + 1]]` or -1 if the condition is not met.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `upper` to `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
