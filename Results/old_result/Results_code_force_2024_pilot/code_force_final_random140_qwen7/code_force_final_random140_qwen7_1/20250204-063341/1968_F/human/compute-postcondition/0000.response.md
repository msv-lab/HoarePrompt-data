Output State: **(n, q) are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all 1 <= i <= n, n and q are assigned the values returned by func_1(int)**.

Explanation: The code `n, q = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument (though the exact integer is not specified, it is an integer). This function returns two values, which are then assigned to `n` and `q`. Since `func_1` is not defined here, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `q`, but we know they are positive integers with the given constraints. The list `a` and the integers `l` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
