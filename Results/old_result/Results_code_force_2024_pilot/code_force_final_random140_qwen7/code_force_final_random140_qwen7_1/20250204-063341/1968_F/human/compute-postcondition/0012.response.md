Output State: **`inds[0]` now contains the element `[1, 2]`, `x` is a list containing three elements where the second element is 0, the third element is 1, and the fourth element is the result of `1 ^ i`.**

Explanation: The code `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends to the list `x` the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` (which is 1) and the variable `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide its specific value, but we know that the new element appended to `x` will be `1 ^ i`.
