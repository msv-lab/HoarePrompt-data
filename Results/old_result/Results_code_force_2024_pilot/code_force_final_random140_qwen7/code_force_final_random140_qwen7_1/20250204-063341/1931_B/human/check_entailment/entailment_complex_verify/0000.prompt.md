You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and there are n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        arr.sort()
        
        if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `arr` is a sorted list, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since no modifications are made in the else part.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations (which is equal to its initial value), but it cannot go below 2. Each iteration processes an input `n` and sorts the array `arr`. The final value of `t` will be the initial value minus the number of iterations completed, and `arr` will be sorted as per the input for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then sorts the list `a` and checks if the list is already sorted. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the sorting condition.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order and prints 'YES' if it is, otherwise 'NO'. However, the problem requires making the amount of water in all containers the same, not just checking if the array is sorted.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
The program will output 'YES' because the array is not sorted, but according to the problem description, it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, so the correct output should be 'NO'.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if the average amount of water per container can be achieved by pouring water between containers. Since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, the average amount of water per container is `sum(a_i) / n`. The program should verify if it's possible to distribute the water such that each container has this average amount.
