Output State: **`current_balance` is increased by the value of `a[i] - target`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `current_balance += a[i] - target` updates the `current_balance` by adding the value of `a[i] - target` to it. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `i` being `i + 1` and `n` still being greater than `i + 1`.
