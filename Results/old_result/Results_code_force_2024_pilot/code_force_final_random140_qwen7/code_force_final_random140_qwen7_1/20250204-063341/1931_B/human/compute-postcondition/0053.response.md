Postcondition: `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is set to `False`. This happens if and only if `current_balance` is less than 0. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, no changes are made to `current_balance`, `i`, or `possible`.
