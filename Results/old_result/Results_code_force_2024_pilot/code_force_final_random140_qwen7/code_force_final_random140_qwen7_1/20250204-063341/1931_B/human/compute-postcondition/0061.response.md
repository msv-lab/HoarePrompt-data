Postcondition: **`current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`. `possible` will be `True` since the condition inside the if statement evaluates to `True`, meaning `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop. `a` is a list of integers and `n` and `target` are as described in the precondition.**
