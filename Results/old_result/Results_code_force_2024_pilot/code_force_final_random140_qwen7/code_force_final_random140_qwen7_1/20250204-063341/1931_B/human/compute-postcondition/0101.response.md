Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It verifies that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and returns nothing directly but processes the input data according to the given constraints.**
