Output State: **`current_balance' is updated to its previous value plus a[i] minus target**.

In this case, the code updates the `current_balance` by adding the value of `a[i]` and then subtracting the `target`. Since the initial values of `current_balance`, `a[i]`, and `target` are not specified, we can only express the new value of `current_balance` in terms of these variables.
