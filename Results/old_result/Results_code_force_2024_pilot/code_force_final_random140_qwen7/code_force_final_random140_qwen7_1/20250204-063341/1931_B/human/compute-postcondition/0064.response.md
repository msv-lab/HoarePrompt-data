Based on the initial state provided:

- `current_balance` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus `n` times `target`.
- `possible` is initially set to `False` if `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise it remains `True`.
- Since the program does not enter the if block, `possible` remains `False` if `current_balance` was less than 0 at any point, and it becomes `True` otherwise.

Given that the code snippet only contains a `print('NO')` statement, regardless of the values of `current_balance` and `possible`, the output will be the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
