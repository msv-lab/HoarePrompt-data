Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The function checks if the sum of the integers `a_i` is divisible by `n` and returns `True` if the condition is met for all test cases, otherwise it returns `False`.**
