Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\). This means `t` is an integer between 1 and 9999 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. Since no specific values for `n` or the input string are given, `arr` could contain any sorted list of integers.

The code snippet only contains a single `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
