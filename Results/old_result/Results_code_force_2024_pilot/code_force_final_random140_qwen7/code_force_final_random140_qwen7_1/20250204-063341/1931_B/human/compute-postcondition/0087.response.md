Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`
   - `possible` is `False`
   - `t` remains unchanged
   - If `current_balance < 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of `range(n)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1` from the previous value.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `current_balance` remains unchanged because it is updated inside the loop body.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `total_water` remains unchanged because it is the sum of all elements in `a` and does not change with each iteration of the loop.
   - `possible` remains `False` unless the loop body changes it.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `current_balance < 0`, the loop will break, but since we are considering the state before breaking, we assume the loop continues.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target`, `i` is `i + 2`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged**.
