Output State: **`current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`, `i` is `i + 1`, `possible` is `False`**.

Explanation: The variable `possible` is set to `False` without any changes to `current_balance` or `i`. The previous value of `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The state of these variables is preserved except for the assignment of `possible` to `False`.
