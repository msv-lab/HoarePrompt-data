Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head; it starts from 0 by default.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`current_balance` is 0, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `True`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `target` is `total_water // n`**
