Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `n` is an integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
