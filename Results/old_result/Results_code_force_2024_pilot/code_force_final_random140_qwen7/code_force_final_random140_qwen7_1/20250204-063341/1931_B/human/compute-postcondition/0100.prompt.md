Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    current_balance = 0
    possible = True
    for i in range(n):
        current_balance += a[i] - target
        if current_balance < 0:
            possible = False
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is at least the length of list `a`, `a` remains a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` remains `False`, `i` is `n`, and if `current_balance < 0` at any point, the loop breaks early and does not process the remaining elements. Additionally, the condition `possible` is true if it is in the if part, otherwise, it remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`. `possible` will be `True` if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop. Otherwise, `possible` will be `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_balance` is `current_balance + sum(a) - n * target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, and if the final value of `current_balance` is less than 0, the loop breaks, otherwise `current_balance` is greater than or equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
