Output State: `t` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `arr` is a sorted list, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since no modifications are made in the else part.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations (which is equal to its initial value), but it will still be within the range of 2 to 10^4 - 2. Each `arr` list processed during the loop iterations will be sorted, and the loop will continue to check each subsequent input `arr` for being in non-decreasing order, printing 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
