Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, `possible` will be `True` if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop. Otherwise, `possible` will be `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `target` is `total_water // n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `total_water // n` to the variable `target`. This operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the initial conditions for `a`, `total_water`, `current_balance`, `possible`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the new value of `target` is calculated based on the division of `total_water` by `n`.
