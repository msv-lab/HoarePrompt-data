Output State: **`current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` remains `False`, `i` is `n`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
