Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`. `possible` will be `False` if `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise it will remain `True`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `current_balance` will reflect the net balance calculated by subtracting `target` (which is the average of the total water divided by `n`) from each element in the list `a` and summing these differences. If at any point during the loop, `current_balance` becomes negative, `possible` will be set to `False`. Otherwise, `possible` will remain `True`.
