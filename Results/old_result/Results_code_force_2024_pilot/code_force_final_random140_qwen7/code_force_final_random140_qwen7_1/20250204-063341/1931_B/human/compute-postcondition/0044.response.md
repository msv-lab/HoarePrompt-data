Output State: **`current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is explicitly set to `False` by the given code. The initial condition that `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`, and the current value of `current_balance` is less than 0, remains unchanged as no operations are performed on `current_balance`. Therefore, `current_balance` is still less than 0, and `possible` is now explicitly set to `False`.
