Output State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target`, `i` is `i + 1`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or condition being checked. Since no variables are reassigned within the `break` statement itself, their values remain as they were before the `break`.
