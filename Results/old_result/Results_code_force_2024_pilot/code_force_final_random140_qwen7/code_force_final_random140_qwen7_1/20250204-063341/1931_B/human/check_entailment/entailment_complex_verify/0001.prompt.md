You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and there are n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

    #State: Output State: `t` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `arr` is a sorted list, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since no modifications are made in the else part.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations (which is equal to its initial value), but it cannot go below 2. Each iteration processes an input `n` and sorts the array `arr`. The final value of `t` will be the initial value minus the number of iterations completed, and `arr` will be sorted as per the input for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then sorts the list `a` and checks if the list is already sorted. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the sorting condition.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index (i) must be less than the destination container index (j).

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (n), the only way to achieve equal distribution is if the initial distribution of water can already be evenly divided among the containers. This means each container should start with the same amount of water, which is the total water divided by n.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - The provided solution sorts the array `arr` and checks if it is a non-decreasing sequence.
   - If the array is sorted and non-decreasing, it implies that the water can be evenly distributed because the smallest amount of water in any container is at least as much as the smallest amount in the next container, and so on.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The sorting approach works under the assumption that the initial distribution can be made uniform through the allowed operations.
   - However, the key point is that the sum being divisible by n ensures that an equal distribution is theoretically possible, but the sorting check alone does not guarantee that the exact equal distribution can be achieved through the specified operations.

5. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The provided solution correctly identifies if the initial distribution can be made uniform by checking if the array is sorted.
   - However, the problem statement specifies that we can pour water from any container to any other container where the source index is less than the destination index. This means we can always redistribute the water to achieve an equal distribution if the total sum is divisible by n.
   - Therefore, the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)))` is sufficient to determine if the initial distribution can be made uniform.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly identifies if the initial distribution can be made uniform, and since the sum is divisible by n, it is always possible to achieve the desired state. Thus, the logic is sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
