### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program does not correctly solve the problem:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water between them. This involves redistributing the water such that each container ends up with the same amount of water, which is the average amount of water per container.

2. **Program Logic**: The current program simply checks if the list of water amounts (`arr`) is sorted in non-decreasing order. It prints 'YES' if the list is sorted and 'NO' otherwise. This logic is flawed because:
   - Sorting the list does not guarantee that the water can be evenly distributed among all containers.
   - The fact that the list is sorted does not imply that the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     5
     4 5 2 1 3
     ```
     - The program sorts the list `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]` to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and prints 'YES'.
     - However, it is impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount of water (since the average is `15/5 = 3`, and we cannot achieve `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` from `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`).

4. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
   - Calculate the average amount of water per container.
   - Check if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has this average amount.

Since the provided program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
