Postcondition: `current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no specific changes are made beyond the initial update to `current_balance`.
