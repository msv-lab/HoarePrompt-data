Postcondition: **`current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains at least as large as the length of list `a`, `a` remains a list of integers, `total_water` is still the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` remains `False`, `i` is `n`, and if `current_balance < 0` at any point, the loop breaks early and does not process the remaining elements. Additionally, the condition `possible` is true.**
