You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_water = sum(a)
        
        target = total_water // n
        
        current_balance = 0
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_balance += a[i] - target
            if current_balance < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in `a` for all test cases minus `n` times `target` for each test case. `possible` will be `True` for each test case if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, otherwise, it will be `False`. `t` will be 0 since all test cases have been processed. `n` will be the length of `a` for each test case, and `total_water` will be the sum of all elements in `a` for each test case. `target` will be `total_water // n` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It verifies that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and returns nothing directly but processes the input data according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
