Output State: `current_balance` is `current_balance + sum(a) - n * target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, and the final value of `current_balance` is less than 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `current_balance` will be the sum of `a[i] - target` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Since the loop breaks when `current_balance` becomes negative, `current_balance` will be less than 0 at the end. The variable `possible` is set to `False` as soon as `current_balance` goes below 0, so it remains `False`. All other variables (`total_water`, `t`, `n`, and `target`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
