Output State: **`current_balance` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` remains `False`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code sets `current_balance` to 0, which updates its value from the initial state where it was defined as `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
