Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \). For each test case, it checks if the sum of the list elements can be evenly distributed among \( n \) parts without any part having a negative balance. If such a distribution is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but ensures that all input data has been verified according to the specified conditions.**
