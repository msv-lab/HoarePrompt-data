Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\). This means `t` is an integer between 2 and 9999, inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. Since no specific values for `n` or the space-separated integers are given, `arr` could be any sorted list of integers.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
