Based on the initial state provided:

- `current_balance` is defined as `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`. This means it is the sum of every other element in the list `a` starting from the first element, each subtracted by `target`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` remains at least as large as the length of list `a`.
- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
- `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
- `possible` remains `False`.
- `i` is set to `n`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Given the information, there is no need to calculate the exact value of `current_balance` because the print statement is not dependent on its value. The focus is on the string that is being printed directly.

Output: **YES**
