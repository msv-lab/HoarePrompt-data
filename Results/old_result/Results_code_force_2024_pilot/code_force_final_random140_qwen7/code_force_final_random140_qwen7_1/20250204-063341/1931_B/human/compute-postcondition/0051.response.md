Output State: **`current_balance` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `target`, `i` is `i + 1`, `possible` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was modifying `current_balance`, incrementing `i`, and setting `possible` to `False`. The values of `current_balance`, `i`, and `possible` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
