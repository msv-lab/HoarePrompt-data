Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `arr` is a sorted list, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since no modifications are made in the else part.**
