The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\). For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**
