Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. The problem requires making the amount of water in all containers the same, not checking if the amounts are sorted.

To solve the problem correctly, you should check if the average amount of water per container (which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers) is an integer. If it is, then it is possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_water = sum(arr)
        avg_water = total_water // n
        
        # Check if the average water per container is an integer
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version correctly determines if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by checking if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers.
