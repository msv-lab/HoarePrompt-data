Output State: **`current_balance` is increased by the value of `a[i] - target`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `possible` is `False`**

Explanation: The line `possible = False` sets the boolean variable `possible` to `False`. It does not affect the values of `current_balance`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, the conditions related to these variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
