Output State: `current_balance` is `current_balance + sum(a) - n * target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, and the final value of `current_balance` is less than 0, causing the loop to break.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `current_balance` will be the sum of `a[i] - target` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Since the loop breaks when `current_balance` becomes negative, `possible` will always be `False` by the end of the loop. The values of `total_water`, `t`, `n`, and `target` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
