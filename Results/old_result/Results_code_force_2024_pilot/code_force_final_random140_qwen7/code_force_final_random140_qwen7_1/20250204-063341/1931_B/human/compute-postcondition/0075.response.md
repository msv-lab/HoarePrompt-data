Output State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `True`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `target` is `total_water // n`**.

This means that the `current_balance` has been updated by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `target` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
