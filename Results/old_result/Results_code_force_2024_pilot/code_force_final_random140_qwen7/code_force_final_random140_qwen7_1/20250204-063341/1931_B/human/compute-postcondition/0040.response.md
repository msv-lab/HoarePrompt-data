Output State: **`current_balance` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` is `True`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

The code sets the variable `possible` to `True`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
