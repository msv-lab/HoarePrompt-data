Output State: **`current_balance` is 0, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` will be `True` if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop. Otherwise, `possible` will be `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `target` is `total_water // n`.**

Explanation: The line `current_balance = 0` initializes `current_balance` to 0. This does not affect the values of `total_water`, `possible`, `t`, `n`, or `target`. The conditions for `possible` remain the same as they were before the line was executed.
