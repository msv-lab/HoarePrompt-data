Output State: **`current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[2] - target + ... + a[n-1] - target`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `possible` remains `False`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. This changes the value of `a` but does not affect the values of `current_balance`, `t`, `n`, `total_water`, `target`, `possible`, or `i`.
