Output State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, and the current value of `current_balance` is less than 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are updated or reassigned, their previous states remain valid.
