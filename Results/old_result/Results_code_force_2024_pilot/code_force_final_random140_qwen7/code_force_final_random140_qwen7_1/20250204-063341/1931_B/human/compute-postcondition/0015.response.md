Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since no other variables or objects are involved in the print statement, and the string `'NO'` is explicitly provided, the output will be:

Output: **'NO'**
