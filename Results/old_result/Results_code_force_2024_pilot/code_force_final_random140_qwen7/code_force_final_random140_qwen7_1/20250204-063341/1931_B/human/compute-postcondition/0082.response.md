Output State: **`current_balance` is `current_balance + a[i] - target`, `i` is `i + 1`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `possible` is `False`, `t` remains unchanged, `target` is `total_water // n`**

Explanation: The code updates `current_balance` by adding `a[i] - target` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the target remains as `total_water // n`.
