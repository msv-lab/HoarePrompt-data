Based on the initial state provided:

- `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`.
- `possible` is `True` because the condition inside the if statement evaluates to `True`, meaning `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` and `target` are as described in the precondition.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
