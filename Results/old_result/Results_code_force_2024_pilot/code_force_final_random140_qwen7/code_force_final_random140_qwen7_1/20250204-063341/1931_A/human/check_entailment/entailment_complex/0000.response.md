Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the encoded integer `n`. This part is correct.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The logic tries to decode the integer `n` into a three-letter word by considering different ranges for `n`:
     - If `n // 26 == 0`, it means the first letter is 'a' (index 1), the second letter is 'a' (index 1), and the third letter is determined by `n - 2`.
     - If `n // 26 == 1`, it means the first letter is 'a' (index 1), the second letter is determined by `n - 27`, and the third letter is 'z' (index 26).
     - If `n // 26 == 2`, it means the first letter is determined by `n - 52`, and both the second and third letters are 'z' (index 26).

3. **Character Conversion**:
   - The program uses `chr(96 + index)` to convert the calculated index back to a character. This conversion is correct for indices between 1 and 26, but the logic for indices greater than 26 needs to be re-evaluated.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the conversion of indices to characters. However, the function's logic is incomplete and does not cover all cases. Specifically, it only handles the range 1 to 26 and incorrectly returns 'd' to 'z' for other cases without specifying the exact character.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is flawed because:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all possible values of `n` (3 to 78).
- The main program logic does not account for the correct character mapping for indices greater than 26.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
