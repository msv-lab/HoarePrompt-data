### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`.
   - The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - The letters 'a' to 'z' are indexed from 1 to 26 respectively.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the value of `n` divided by 26.
   - The logic used to determine the characters for `a`, `b`, and `c` is as follows:
     - If `n // 26 == 0`, then `a` and `b` are both 'a' (index 1), and `c` is the remaining part of `n` minus 2.
     - If `n // 26 == 1`, then `a` is 'a', `b` is the remaining part of `n` minus 27, and `c` is 'z' (index 26).
     - If `n // 26 == 2`, then `a` is the remaining part of `n` minus 52, and `b` and `c` are both 'z'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic handles the cases where `n // 26` is 0, 1, or 2, which covers the ranges 3 to 26, 27 to 52, and 53 to 78 respectively.
   - However, the logic does not handle the case where `n` is between 27 and 51 correctly. Specifically, the conditions do not account for the fact that `b` and `c` should be the same when `n // 26` is 1, and `a` and `b` should be the same when `n // 26` is 0.

4. **Testing the Cases:**
   - Let's test the given examples again:
     - For `n = 24`:
       - `24 // 26 == 0`, so `a = 'a'`, `b = 'a'`, `c = 24 - 2 = 'v'`. This gives "aav".
     - For `n = 70`:
       - `70 // 26 == 2`, so `a = 70 - 52 = 'r'`, `b = 'z'`, `c = 'z'`. This gives "rzz".
     - For `n = 3`:
       - `3 // 26 == 0`, so `a = 'a'`, `b = 'a'`, `c = 3 - 2 = 'a'`. This gives "aaa".
     - For `n = 55`:
       - `55 // 26 == 2`, so `a = 55 - 52 = 'c'`, `b = 'z'`, `c = 'z'`. This gives "czz".
     - For `n = 48`:
       - `48 // 26 == 1`, so `a = 'a'`, `b = 48 - 27 = 'u'`, `c = 'z'`. This gives "auz".

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does handle the cases correctly based on the division of `n` by 26.
   - The conditions cover all possible values of `n` within the specified range.

### Correctness:
- The given program is **correct** because it handles all possible values of `n` correctly and produces the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
