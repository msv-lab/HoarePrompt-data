Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all possible test cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the full range of values for `n` and does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Values**: The logic in the program is overly simplistic and does not cover all possible sums (`n`). For instance, for `n = 24`, the program outputs `"aav"` instead of `"cat"`, which is the correct lexicographically smallest word.

2. **General Formula Missing**: The program lacks a general formula to calculate the correct letters for any given `n`. It only covers specific cases (e.g., `n // 26 == 0, 1, 2`) without handling other cases properly.

3. **Complexity Not Addressed**: The problem requires considering all possible combinations of three letters that sum up to `n`, and finding the lexicographically smallest one. The current approach does not address this complexity.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible combinations of three letters (from 'a' to 'z') and find the combination that sums up to `n` and is lexicographically smallest. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_smallest_word(n):
    for i in range(1, 27):
        for j in range(1, 27):
            for k in range(1, 27):
                if i + j + k == n:
                    return chr(i + 96) + chr(j + 96) + chr(k + 96)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(find_smallest_word(n))
```

This program iterates through all possible combinations of three letters and finds the lexicographically smallest one that sums up to `n`. This approach ensures correctness for all test cases.
