Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an updated input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the last index of 'B' in `s`, `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`, `s` is the updated input string.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `min_paint` to be the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
