Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found; `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found; `min_paint` is the difference between `last_black` and `first_black` plus one; `s` is updated to the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `first_black`, `last_black`, `min_paint`) remain unchanged with their previous values.
