Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and state transitions:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the length of the strip (`n`) and the string representing the strip (`s`).
3. **Finding Black Cells**: 
   - `first_black` finds the index of the first black cell ('B').
   - `last_black` finds the index of the last black cell ('B').
4. **Calculating Minimum Paint Length**: 
   - If there are no black cells (both `first_black` and `last_black` are -1), the entire strip is already white, so the minimum length is 0. However, since it's guaranteed that at least one cell is black, this case does not apply here.
   - Otherwise, `min_paint` is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`, which represents the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.
5. **Output**: The result is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly identifies the segment containing all black cells and calculates its length accurately. The only edge case (all cells being white) is not handled explicitly but is not required according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
