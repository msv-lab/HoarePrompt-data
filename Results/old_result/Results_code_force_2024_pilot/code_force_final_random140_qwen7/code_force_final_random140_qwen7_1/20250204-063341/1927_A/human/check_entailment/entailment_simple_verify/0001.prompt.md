You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        first_black = s.find('B')
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        print(min_paint)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        first_black = s.find('B')
        
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        
        print(min_paint)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, as it starts as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive) and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `n` will be an input integer, `s` will be an input string, `first_black` will be the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found; `last_black` will be the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found; `min_paint` will be `last_black - first_black + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that, when painted white, will turn all black cells in the segment to white.
   - This means we need to find the shortest segment that includes all black cells.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s` representing the strip.
   - It then finds the first occurrence of 'B' using `s.find('B')` and the last occurrence of 'B' using `s.rfind('B')`.
   - The variable `min_paint` is calculated as the difference between the positions of the first and last black cells plus one (`last_black - first_black + 1`).
   - Finally, it prints `min_paint`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic used to calculate `min_paint` is correct. If we find the first and last black cells, the segment from the first to the last black cell will cover all black cells.
   - However, we need to ensure that this segment indeed turns all black cells to white, not just the segment itself.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there is only one black cell, the segment length should be 1, which the code correctly calculates.
   - If the black cells are at the boundaries, the segment length should be correct.
   - If the black cells are scattered, the segment from the first to the last black cell will cover all of them.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the example "WBBWBW", the first black cell is at position 2 and the last is at position 5. The segment length is `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`, which is correct.
   - For "B", the first and last black cell is at position 1, so the segment length is `1 - 1 + 1 = 1`, which is correct.
   - For "BBW", the first black cell is at position 1 and the last is at position 2, so the segment length is `2 - 1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all black cells to white. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
