Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found.**

Explanation: The code `first_black = s.find('B')` assigns the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' in the string `s` to the variable `first_black`. If 'B' is not found in the string `s`, `find` returns -1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
