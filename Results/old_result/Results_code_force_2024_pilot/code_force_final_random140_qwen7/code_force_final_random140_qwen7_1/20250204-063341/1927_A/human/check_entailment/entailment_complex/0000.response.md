Reasoning: 
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Finding First and Last Black Cells**: The program uses `s.find('B')` to find the index of the first occurrence of 'B' and `s.rfind('B')` to find the index of the last occurrence of 'B'. These methods return the index of the first and last 'B' characters, respectively, or -1 if 'B' is not present.

3. **Calculating Minimum Paint Length**: The program calculates the minimum length of the segment to be painted by computing `last_black - first_black + 1`. This formula correctly gives the length of the segment containing all black cells.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum length for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there is only one black cell (`first_black == last_black`) or when the entire strip is initially black (`first_black == -1`).

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
