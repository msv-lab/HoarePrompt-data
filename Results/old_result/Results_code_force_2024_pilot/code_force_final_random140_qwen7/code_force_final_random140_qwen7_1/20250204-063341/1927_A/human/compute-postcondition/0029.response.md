Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `x` is a list containing characters from the input string. If 'B' is found in the list `x`, `i` remains 2, `t` remains unchanged, and `x` is a list containing characters from the input string with additional information about the start and end indices of 'B'. If 'B' is not found in the list `x`, `i` remains 2, `t` remains unchanged, and `x` is a list containing characters from the input string.
