Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `k`.
   - The loop range is `range(r)`, which means `k` will iterate from 0 to `r-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `k`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `k = 0`, we need to set `k` to 0.

3. **Determine the Value of `r`:**
   - From the postcondition, we know `r` is defined as `n^2 // 2`.
   - We need to ensure that `r` is correctly set to `n^2 // 2`.

4. **Check the Range of `r`:**
   - Given `2 ≤ n ≤ 500` and `n` is odd, the maximum value of `n` is 499.
   - Therefore, the maximum value of `r` is `499^2 // 2 = 124001`.
   - The minimum value of `n` is 3 (the smallest odd number in the given range), so the minimum value of `r` is `3^2 // 2 = 4.5`, which rounds to 4.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `r` must be at least 1 because `range(r)` will start from 0 and go up to `r-1`.
   - Given the constraints on `n`, `r` will always be at least 1.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `k` should be set to 0.
   - `r` should be set to `n^2 // 2`.

Given these points, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`k` is 0, `r` is `n^2 // 2`**.
