Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for checking if the given array can form a progressive square. Specifically, the program does not check the values of the elements in the array to ensure they match the pattern required for a progressive square. 

A progressive square is constructed such that each element \(a_{i,j}\) is calculated using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\). The program does not validate this condition for all elements in the array. Instead, it checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted array matches the expected value \((n-1) \cdot (c + d)\), which is not sufficient to guarantee the formation of a progressive square.

For example, consider the following test case:
- \(n = 3\)
- \(c = 2\)
- \(d = 3\)
- Array: \([3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8]\)

Sorting the array gives \([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 11]\). The difference between the maximum and minimum elements is \(11 - 3 = 8\), which matches \((3-1) \cdot (2 + 3) = 10\). However, the array does not contain the correct sequence to form a progressive square. The correct sequence would be \([1, 3, 5; 4, 6, 8; 7, 9, 11]\).

The program incorrectly returns "YES" for this case because it only checks the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, without verifying the actual values in the array against the progressive square formula. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
