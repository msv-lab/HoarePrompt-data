Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 sorted integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the sum of the first (`l[0]`) and last (`l[-1]`) elements of the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
