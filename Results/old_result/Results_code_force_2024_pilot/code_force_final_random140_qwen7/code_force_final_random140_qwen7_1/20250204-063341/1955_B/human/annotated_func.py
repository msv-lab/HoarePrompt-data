#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()

        return 'no'
        #The program returns 'no'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 sorted integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The difference between the last and the first element of `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d)
    a = l[0] + l[-1]

    if (n % 2 != 0) :
        if (not l[r] == a // 2) :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns 'NO'
        #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and `n` is odd, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 sorted integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and `n` is odd, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 sorted integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to `n^2 // 2 - 1`, `r` will remain as `n^2 // 2`, and for every `i` from `0` to `n^2 // 2 - 1`, `l[i]` will be equal to `l[-1 - i]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `k` will have reached the midpoint of the list `l` minus one. The value of `r` will still be half the length of the list. Additionally, the elements of the list `l` will be symmetric around the center, meaning the element at index `i` is the same as the element at index `-1 - i` for all valid indices `i`.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), where \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 500, and \( c \) and \( d \) are integers between 1 and \( 10^6 \). It also accepts a list \( l \) containing \( n^2 \) integers, each between 1 and \( 10^9 \). The function first sorts the list \( l \) and checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in \( l \) equals \((n - 1) \times (c + d)\). If not, it returns 'no'. If the condition is met, it further checks if the middle element of the list equals half the sum of the first and last elements when \( n \) is odd. If this condition is also met, it then verifies if the list is symmetric around its center. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no' multiple times based on the failure of any of the above conditions.
