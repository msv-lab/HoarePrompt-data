Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to `n^2 // 2 - 1`, `r` will remain as `n^2 // 2`, and for every `i` from `0` to `n^2 // 2 - 1`, `l[i]` will be equal to `l[-1 - i]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `k` will have reached the midpoint of the list `l` minus one. The value of `r` will still be half the length of the list. Additionally, the elements of the list `l` will be symmetric around the center, meaning the element at index `i` is the same as the element at index `-1 - i` for all valid indices `i`.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes'
