Reasoning:

1. **Sorting Check**: The program sorts the list `l` before checking the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This step ensures that the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list is calculated correctly, which is a necessary condition for a progressive square.

2. **Difference Check**: The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the sorted list equals `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This is a crucial condition for a list to be a part of a progressive square. If this condition fails, the function immediately returns 'no'.

3. **Symmetry Check for Odd N**: If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list (`l[r]`) is equal to half the sum of the first and last elements (`a // 2`). This check ensures that the middle element of the progressive square is correctly placed.

4. **Symmetry Check for All Elements**: The program then checks if the list is symmetric around the center. This means that for every element at position `i`, the element at position `n^2 - 1 - i` should be the same. This is a key property of a progressive square.

5. **Return Statement**: If all the above conditions are satisfied, the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no' at some point during the checks.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly determines whether the given list can form a progressive square based on the provided rules.

Correctness: **True**
