### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to check if a given array of \( n^2 \) integers can form a progressive square matrix with the given \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
   - A progressive square matrix is defined by the rule \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function first sorts the list `l`.
   - It checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `l` equals \((n - 1) \times (c + d)\).
   - It checks if the middle element (if `n` is odd) is half the sum of the smallest and largest elements.
   - It checks if the elements are symmetric around the middle.

3. **Conditions Analysis**:
   - The first condition checks if the range of values in the sorted list matches the expected range for a progressive square. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
   - The second condition checks if the middle element (when `n` is odd) is consistent with the expected value. This is another necessary but not sufficient condition.
   - The third condition checks if the list is symmetric around the middle. This is another necessary but not sufficient condition.

4. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - While these conditions are necessary, they are not sufficient to ensure that the array can form a progressive square. For example, the array might satisfy these conditions but still not follow the exact pattern required by the progressive square definition.
   - The original assessment correctly points out that these conditions alone do not guarantee the formation of a progressive square.

5. **Additional Checks Needed**:
   - To fully validate if the array can form a progressive square, we would need to reconstruct the matrix and check if each element fits the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).
   - The provided code does not perform this reconstruction and validation step.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not fully validate the formation of a progressive square and relies on insufficient conditions.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
