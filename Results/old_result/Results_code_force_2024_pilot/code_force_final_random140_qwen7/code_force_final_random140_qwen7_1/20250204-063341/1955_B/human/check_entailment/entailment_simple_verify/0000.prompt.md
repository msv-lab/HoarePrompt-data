You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for checking if the given array can form a progressive square. Specifically, the program does not check the values of the elements in the array to ensure they match the pattern required for a progressive square. 

A progressive square is constructed such that each element \(a_{i,j}\) is calculated using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\). The program does not validate this condition for all elements in the array. Instead, it checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted array matches the expected value \((n-1) \cdot (c + d)\), which is not sufficient to guarantee the formation of a progressive square.

For example, consider the following test case:
- \(n = 3\)
- \(c = 2\)
- \(d = 3\)
- Array: \([3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8]\)

Sorting the array gives \([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 11]\). The difference between the maximum and minimum elements is \(11 - 3 = 8\), which matches \((3-1) \cdot (2 + 3) = 10\). However, the array does not contain the correct sequence to form a progressive square. The correct sequence would be \([1, 3, 5; 4, 6, 8; 7, 9, 11]\).

The program incorrectly returns "YES" for this case because it only checks the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, without verifying the actual values in the array against the progressive square formula. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
