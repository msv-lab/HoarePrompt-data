You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    if (not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d)) :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns 'no'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 sorted integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The difference between the last and the first element of `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d)
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if (n % 2 != 0) :
        if (not l[r] == a // 2) :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns 'NO'
        #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and `n` is odd, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 sorted integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and `n` is odd, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 sorted integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `r` is n^2 // 2, and `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to `n^2 // 2 - 1`, `r` will remain as `n^2 // 2`, and for every `i` from `0` to `n^2 // 2 - 1`, `l[i]` will be equal to `l[-1 - i]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `k` will have reached the midpoint of the list `l` minus one. The value of `r` will still be half the length of the list. Additionally, the elements of the list `l` will be symmetric around the center, meaning the element at index `i` is the same as the element at index `-1 - i` for all valid indices `i`.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `c` and `d` are integers between 1 and 10^6. Additionally, it accepts a list `l` containing `n^2` integers, each between 1 and 10^9. Depending on the content of the list `l`, the function returns either 'no' five times or 'yes' once.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'no'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'no'

Case_4: The program returns 'no'

Case_5: The program returns 'no'

Case_6: The program returns 'yes'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
