Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `k` is 0
  - `r` is `n^2 // 2`
  - `l[k]` is equal to `l[-1 - k]`

- For loop:
  ```python
  for k in range(r):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `k` is used in the loop.
   - The loop range is defined by `r`.

2. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 0.
   - The loop will continue as long as `k < r`.
   - Since `k` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `k` will be 1.
   - Therefore, the condition `k < r` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - `k` will be incremented to 1.
   - `r` remains unchanged because it is determined by `n` and does not change within the loop.

4. **Check the Condition `l[k] == l[-1 - k]`:**
   - Initially, `l[0]` is equal to `l[-1]`.
   - After the first iteration, `k` becomes 1.
   - We need to check if `l[1]` is equal to `l[-2]`.

### Final State:
- `k` is now 1.
- `r` remains `n^2 // 2`.
- The condition `l[k] == l[-1 - k]` should still hold true for `k = 1`.

### Answer:
State: **`k` is 1, `r` is `n^2 // 2`, and `l[1]` is equal to `l[-2]`**
