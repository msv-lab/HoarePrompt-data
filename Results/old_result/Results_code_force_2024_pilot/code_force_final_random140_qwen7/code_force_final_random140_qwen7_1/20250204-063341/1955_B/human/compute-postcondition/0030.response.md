Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `c` and `d` are integers between 1 and 10^6. Additionally, it accepts a list `l` containing `n^2` integers, each between 1 and 10^9. Depending on the content of the list `l`, the function returns either 'no' five times or 'yes' once.**
