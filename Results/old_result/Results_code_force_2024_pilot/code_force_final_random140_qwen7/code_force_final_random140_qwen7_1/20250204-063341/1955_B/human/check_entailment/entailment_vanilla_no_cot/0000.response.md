Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether the given array `l` can form a progressive square for the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

1. **Sorting the List**: The code sorts the list `l`. However, sorting alone is not sufficient to verify if the elements can form a progressive square. The order of elements in a progressive square is crucial and cannot be determined just by sorting.

2. **Checking the Difference Between First and Last Element**: The check `if not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d):` is incorrect. This formula only checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is correct, but it doesn't ensure that the sequence of numbers forms a progressive square.

3. **Middle Element Check**: The check for the middle element `if not l[r] == a // 2:` is also incorrect. In a progressive square, the middle element should be `(a11 + an1) / 2`, but this check alone is insufficient.

4. **Pairing Elements**: The check `for k in range(r): if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:` ensures that the elements pair up correctly, but it doesn't validate the arithmetic progression required for a progressive square.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to generate the expected progressive square based on `n`, `c`, and `d`, and then compare it with the given array `l`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Generate the progressive square
    progressive_square = []
    current_value = c
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(n):
            row.append(current_value)
            current_value += d
        progressive_square.append(row)

    # Flatten the progressive square
    expected_values = sorted([item for sublist in progressive_square for item in sublist])

    # Sort the given list
    l.sort()

    # Check if the sorted list matches the expected values
    if l == expected_values:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This solution generates the expected progressive square, flattens it, and compares it with the sorted input list to determine if the input list can form a progressive square.
