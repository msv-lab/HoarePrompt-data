Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is equal to `2 * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`, and `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 1.
   - The value of `s` does not change within the loop head, so it remains as `2 * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`. It should be set to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is equal to `2 * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`, `i` is 1**
