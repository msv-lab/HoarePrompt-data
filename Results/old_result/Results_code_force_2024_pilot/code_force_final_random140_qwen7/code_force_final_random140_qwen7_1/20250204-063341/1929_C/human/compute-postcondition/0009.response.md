Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `k` is the first integer entered
   - `a` is the third integer entered
   - `s` is 4
   - `x` is a positive integer and \(x > 0\)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` should be `x - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`. Therefore, `i` should be `x - 1` and `x` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged: \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `k` remains unchanged: the first integer entered
   - `a` remains unchanged: the third integer entered
   - `s` remains 4
   - `i` becomes `x - 1`
   - `x` remains the same: a positive integer and \(x > 0\)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer entered, `a` is the third integer entered, `s` is 4, `i` is \(x - 1\), `x` is a positive integer and \(x > 0\)**
