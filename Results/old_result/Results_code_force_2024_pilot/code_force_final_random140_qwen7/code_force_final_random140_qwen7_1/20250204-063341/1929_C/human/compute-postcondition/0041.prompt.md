Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer entered, `a` is the third integer entered, `s` is 6, `i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer and \(x > 2\).

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `s` increases by `s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting with `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 3. After the second iteration, `s` becomes 4. After the third iteration, `s` becomes 5. Following the pattern, after the fourth iteration, `s` will become 6. The variable `i` increments with each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `i` will be 2. Since the loop runs `x` times, `x` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute 3 times and continue for one more iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The value of `s` will be 8, and `i` will be 3.

Explanation: Given the pattern from the first three iterations, we can deduce that each iteration doubles the previous value of `s` after the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting with the third iteration's result (`s = 4`), the next iteration would double it to `8`, and since `i` increments by 1 each iteration, it will be `3` after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 7, `x` must be greater than or equal to 5, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `a` is an input integer.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have incremented to 7, as it starts from 4 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `x` must remain greater than or equal to 5 for the loop to execute at least 3 times, and since we are considering all iterations, it will continue to be greater than or equal to 5. The value of `s` will keep updating according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
