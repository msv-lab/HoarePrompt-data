Based on the initial state provided, we know that `s` is 8 and `i` is 3. However, the print statement does not directly reference `s` or `i`. Instead, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints either "YES" or "NO" based on the result of this comparison.

Since the values of `a` and `s` are not explicitly given in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact output without knowing the value of `a`. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `a`.

Output: **"YES" if a >= 8 else "NO"**
