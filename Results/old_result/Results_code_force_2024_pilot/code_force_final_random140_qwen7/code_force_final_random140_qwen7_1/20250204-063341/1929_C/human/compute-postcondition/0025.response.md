Output State: The value of `s` will be 8, and `i` will be 3.

Explanation: Given the pattern from the first three iterations, we can deduce that each iteration doubles the previous value of `s` after the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting with the third iteration's result (`s = 4`), the next iteration would double it to `8`, and since `i` increments by 1 each iteration, it will be `3` after all iterations.
