Output State: **`s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1`**.

In this case, the initial state does not specify the values of `s` or `k`. The code updates `s` to be the value of `s // (k - 1) + 1`. Since the exact values of `s` and `k` are not provided, the output state is described in terms of the operation performed on `s`.
