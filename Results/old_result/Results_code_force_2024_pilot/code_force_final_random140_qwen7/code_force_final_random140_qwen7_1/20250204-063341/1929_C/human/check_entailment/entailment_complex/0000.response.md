Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\).
3. It initializes \(s\) to 1.
4. It then enters a loop that runs \(x\) times. In each iteration, \(s\) is updated according to the formula \(s += s // (k - 1) + 1\).
5. After the loop, it checks if \(a \geq s\) and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
6. The logic for calculating \(s\) ensures that Sasha can potentially achieve any number of coins \(n\) if \(a \geq s\), given the constraints and the strategy described in the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins \(n\).

Correctness: **True**
