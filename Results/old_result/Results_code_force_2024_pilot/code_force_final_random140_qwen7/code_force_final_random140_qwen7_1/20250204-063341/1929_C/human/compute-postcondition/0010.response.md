Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer entered, `a` is the third integer entered, `s` is 5, `i` is \(x - 1\), `x` is a positive integer and \(x > 0`**.

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Given that the initial value of `s` is 4, the new value of `s` becomes 4 + (4 // (k - 1) + 1). Since `k` is an integer, `s // (k - 1)` evaluates to 1 when `k` is 2 (the smallest value greater than 1), making the new value of `s` equal to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
