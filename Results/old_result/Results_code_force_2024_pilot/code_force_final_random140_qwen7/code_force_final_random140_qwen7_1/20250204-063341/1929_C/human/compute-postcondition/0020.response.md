Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- The variable `s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1`.

### Loop Head
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(x):`

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` is being incremented in each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < x`.
- We need to determine the new value of `s` after the loop starts its next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.
2. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, if the loop is about to start its next iteration, `i` will be `0` at the beginning of the first iteration, `1` at the beginning of the second iteration, and so on.
3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `0` (if it's the first iteration), `1` (if it's the second iteration), and so on.
4. **Value of `s`**: The value of `s` does not change within the loop itself based on the given information. It remains `s = s // (k - 1) + 1` until the loop ends or the value of `s` is explicitly changed within the loop body, which is not mentioned here.

### Conclusion
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `0` (if it's the first iteration), `1` (if it's the second iteration), and so on.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

### Final State
- The only state that changes is `i`, which will be `0` at the start of the next iteration.
- The value of `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`s` is equal to `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 0**
