You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 10, `x` is a positive integer such that \(x \geq 5\), `s` is the final value calculated after executing the loop \(x\) times starting from `s = 1` and updating according to `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`, `a` is an input integer.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs `x` times, and each iteration updates `s` as per the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting from `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 3. After the second iteration, `s` becomes 4. After the third iteration, `s` becomes 5. This pattern continues, and since `i` increments by 1 with each iteration, after all `x` iterations, `i` will be `x + 3`. Given that the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be 10 if `x` is 7 (since \(7 + 3 = 10\)). The variable `x` must be at least 5 for the loop to run all its iterations, and `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The final value of `s` will be the result of applying the update rule `x` times starting from `s = 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of integers \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\). For each input, it calculates a value \(s\) starting from 1 and updating it \(x\) times using the formula \(s += s // (k - 1) + 1\). Finally, it prints 'YES' if \(a \geq s\), otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Determine if Sasha can ensure he has at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).
2. **Rules**:
   - Bet amount \( y \) must be a positive integer and cannot exceed Sasha's current number of coins.
   - If Sasha wins, his coins increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - If Sasha loses, his coins decrease by \( y \).
   - Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
3. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - \( k \): Number of times the bet is increased in case of a win.
   - \( x \): Maximum number of consecutive losses.
   - \( a \): Initial number of coins Sasha has.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates over the number of test cases and calculates a value `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can eventually have at least \( n \) coins.

#### Key Logic:
- The loop runs from 0 to \( x-1 \) (i.e., for \( i \) from 0 to \( x-1 \)).
- Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula: 
  \[
  s += \frac{s}{k-1} + 1
  \]
- This formula suggests that Sasha can recover from a series of losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.

### Verification
To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider the logic and the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: \( k = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), \( a = 7 \)
   - Sasha can place 1 coin and if he loses, he can place 2 coins next time.
   - The program calculates \( s \) as:
     \[
     s = 1 + \left(\frac{1}{2-1} + 1\right) = 1 + 2 = 3
     \]
   - Since \( a = 7 \geq 3 \), the program prints "YES".

2. **Example 2**: \( k = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), \( a = 1 \)
   - Sasha starts with 1 coin and can only place 1 coin.
   - The program calculates \( s \) as:
     \[
     s = 1 + \left(\frac{1}{2-1} + 1\right) = 1 + 2 = 3
     \]
   - Since \( a = 1 < 3 \), the program prints "NO".

3. **Example 3**: \( k = 2 \), \( x = 3 \), \( a = 15 \)
   - Sasha can place 1 coin and if he loses, he can place 2 coins next time.
   - The program calculates \( s \) as:
     \[
     s = 1 + \left(\frac{1}{2-1} + 1\right) + \left(\frac{2}{2-1} + 1\right) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
     \]
   - Since \( a = 15 \geq 6 \), the program prints "YES".

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can ensure he has at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \). The calculation of `s` ensures that Sasha can recover from a series of losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.
