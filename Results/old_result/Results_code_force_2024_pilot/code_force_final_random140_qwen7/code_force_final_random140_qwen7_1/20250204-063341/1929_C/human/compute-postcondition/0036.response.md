Output State: **`i` is 6, `x` must be greater than or equal to 5, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to it. However, since `k` is not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `s`. Therefore, the updated value of `s` is expressed as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
