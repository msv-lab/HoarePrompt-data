Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the strategy for Sasha to ensure he can achieve any number of coins. Specifically, the program calculates `s` as the sum of Sasha's coins after `x` consecutive losses, but this calculation does not account for the varying bet sizes based on wins and losses as described in the problem.

For instance, consider the test case `(k=2, x=1, a=1)`:
- According to the problem, Sasha starts with 1 coin.
- If he loses, he cannot place any more bets because he would lose more than 1 time in a row, which contradicts the rule.
- However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" for this case because it calculates `s` as 2 (1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1), which is based on the assumption that Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin after a loss, which is not possible in this scenario.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
