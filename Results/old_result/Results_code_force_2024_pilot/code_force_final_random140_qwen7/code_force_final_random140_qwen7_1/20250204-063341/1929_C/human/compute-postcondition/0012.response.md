Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer entered, `a` is the third integer entered, `s` is 6, `i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer and \(x > 2\).

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `s` increases by `s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting with `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 3. After the second iteration, `s` becomes 4. After the third iteration, `s` becomes 5. Following the pattern, after the fourth iteration, `s` will become 6. The variable `i` increments with each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `i` will be 2. Since the loop runs `x` times, `x` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute 3 times and continue for one more iteration.
