Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, and `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user converted from a space-separated string of integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer. Since `t` is a positive integer at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the user has already input a positive integer for the loop count.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user needs to input another positive integer. Therefore, `t` will be updated to this new positive integer input by the user.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` is now the new positive integer input by the user.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ar` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`t` is a new positive integer input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user converted from a space-separated string of integers.**

However, since we need to provide a specific format for the answer, we can represent it as:

State: **`t` is a new positive integer input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user converted from a space-separated string of integers.**
