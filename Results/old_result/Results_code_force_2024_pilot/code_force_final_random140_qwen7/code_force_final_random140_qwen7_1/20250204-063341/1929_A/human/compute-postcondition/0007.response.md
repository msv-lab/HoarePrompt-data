Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` is an input integer. We need to know the value of `n` to proceed.
   - `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, converted from a space-separated string of integers. Let's denote this list as `ar = [a1, a2, ..., an]` where `a1 < a2 < ... < an`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
   ```

   - The expression inside the `sum` function calculates the difference between each consecutive pair of elements in the list `ar` starting from the second element (`ar[1]`) up to the `n-1`th element (`ar[n-1]`).
   - Specifically, it computes the differences: `(ar[1] - ar[0]), (ar[2] - ar[1]), ..., (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])`.
   - The `sum` function then adds up these differences.

Given the above, let's describe the output:

- The output will be the sum of the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the list `ar` from the first to the `n-1`th element.
- If `ar = [a1, a2, ..., an]`, the output will be: \((a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - an-1)\).

Therefore, the output is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` up to the `n-1`th element.

Output: **sum of differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` up to the `n-1`th element**
