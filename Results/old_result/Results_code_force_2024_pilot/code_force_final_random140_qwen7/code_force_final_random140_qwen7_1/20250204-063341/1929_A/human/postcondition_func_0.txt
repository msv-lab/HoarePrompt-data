The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function then prints this sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final value of \( t \), which is the number of test cases processed.
