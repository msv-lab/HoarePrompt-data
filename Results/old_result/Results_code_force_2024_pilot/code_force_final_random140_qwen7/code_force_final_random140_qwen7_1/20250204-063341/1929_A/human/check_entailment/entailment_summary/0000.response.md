Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The approach taken in the program is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct because:

1. Sorting the array ensures that the largest possible positive differences between consecutive elements are achieved.
2. By calculating the sum of these differences, we get the maximum possible beauty of the array.

Let's break down the steps:
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) of the array and the array elements.
- It sorts the array.
- It calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- Finally, it prints the result for each test case and the total number of test cases processed.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **True**
