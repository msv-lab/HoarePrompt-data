Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty of the array. The key insight is to maximize the difference between the largest and smallest elements while minimizing the differences between other pairs.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should place the largest element at one end and the smallest element at the other end, and then sort the remaining elements in ascending order. This ensures that the largest positive differences are utilized.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        max_beauty = ar[-1] - ar[0]
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            max_beauty += ar[i+1] - ar[i]
        print(max_beauty)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array, calculates the maximum possible beauty by placing the smallest and largest elements at the ends and then summing up the differences between consecutive elements.
