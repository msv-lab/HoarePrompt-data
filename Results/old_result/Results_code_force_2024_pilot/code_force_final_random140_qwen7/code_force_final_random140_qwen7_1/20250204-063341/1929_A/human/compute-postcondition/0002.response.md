Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converts them to integers, sorts them, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `ar`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
