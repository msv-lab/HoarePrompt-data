### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should maximize the positive differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\).
   - This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` takes an input for the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the elements of the array.
   - It sorts the array \(ar\) in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty using the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (ar[i] - ar[i-1])\).

4. **Verification:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the next smallest elements, maximizing the positive differences.
   - The calculation of the beauty using the sorted array is correct.

5. **Examples:**
   - For the first test case: \( [2, 1, 3] \) becomes \( [1, 2, 3] \). The beauty is \( (2-1) + (3-2) = 2 \).
   - For the second test case: \( [69, 69, 69] \) remains unchanged. The beauty is \( 0 \).
   - For the third test case: \( [100, 54, 80, 43, 90] \) becomes \( [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] \). The beauty is \( (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57 \).
   - For the fourth test case: \( [3, 4, 3, 3] \) becomes \( [3, 3, 3, 4] \). The beauty is \( (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1 \).
   - For the fifth test case: \( [2, 1] \) becomes \( [1, 2] \). The beauty is \( (2-1) = 1 \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by sorting it and then calculating the differences between consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:
