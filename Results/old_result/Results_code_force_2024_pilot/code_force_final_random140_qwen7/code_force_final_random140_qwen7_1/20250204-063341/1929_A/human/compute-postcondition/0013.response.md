Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` being a new positive integer input by the user after the last iteration. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, converted from a space-separated string of integers. After all iterations, the final value of `t` will be the input provided for the last iteration, and the corresponding `ar` will be the sorted list of integers for the last input `n`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the value it was set to on the last iteration, `n` will be the last input integer, and `ar` will be the sorted list of integers from the last input, all based on the inputs provided during the last iteration of the loop.
