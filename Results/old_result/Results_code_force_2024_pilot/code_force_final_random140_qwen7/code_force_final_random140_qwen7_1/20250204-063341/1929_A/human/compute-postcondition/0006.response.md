Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user converted from a space-separated string of integers.**

Explanation: The code first takes a space-separated string of integers as input, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, and then sorts the resulting list of integers. The sorted list is assigned to `ar`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
