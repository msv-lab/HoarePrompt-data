The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 0, so after the increment, `i` is now 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is (d + 1) // 2, `d` is now (n - 1), `h` is now `n`, `k` is an integer input from the user, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**
