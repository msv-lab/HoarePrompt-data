To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is:
```
while s < k and d > 0:
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `k` must be greater than 1
- `s` is 2
- `d` is `n // 4`
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
1. `s < k`
2. `d > 0`

Let's check each condition:

1. **Condition `s < k`:**
   - `s` is currently 2.
   - `k` must be greater than 1 (as given).
   - For `s < k` to remain true, `k` must still be greater than 2.

2. **Condition `d > 0`:**
   - `d` is `n // 4`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (as given).
   - For `d > 0`, `n` must be greater than 0 and divisible by 4 (since `n // 4` would then be a positive integer).

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be greater than 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0 and divisible by 4.

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0 and divisible by 4, `k` must be greater than 2, `s` is 2, `d` is `n // 4`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**
