Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is still greater than 0 and divisible by 64, `k` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\), `s` is 4, `d` is 1, `h` is \(n // 8\), `p` is 4, `g` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\), `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\)**.

Explanation: The code calculates `y` as \(2^{(i - 1)} * f\), where `i` is 4 and `f` is `k - g`. Since `i` is 4, \(2^{(i - 1)}\) is \(2^3 = 8\). Therefore, `y` is \(8 * (k - g)\). The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` remain unchanged.
