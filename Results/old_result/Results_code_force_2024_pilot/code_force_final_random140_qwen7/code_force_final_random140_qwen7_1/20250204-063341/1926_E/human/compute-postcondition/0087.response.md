Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined, and the integer input from the user is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integer inputs from the user and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. It does not affect the values of `i`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y`. Additionally, the problem statement mentions that the integer input from the user is decreased by 1, which means `n` is now one less than the original input. All other variables retain their initial states.
