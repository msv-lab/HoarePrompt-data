Output State: **`i` must be greater than 3, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to \((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2\), `p` is 3, `g` is doubled from its initial value, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
