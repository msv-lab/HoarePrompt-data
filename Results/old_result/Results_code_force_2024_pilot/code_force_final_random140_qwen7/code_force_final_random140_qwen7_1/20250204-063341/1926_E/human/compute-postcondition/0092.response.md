Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The line `p = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `p`. Since `p` was already 1 in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values as no operations were performed on them.
