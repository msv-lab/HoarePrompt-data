Output State: **`i` must be greater than 4, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to \((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2 - ((h + 1) // 2)\), `p` is 4, `g` is equal to its initial value plus \((h + 1) // 2\), `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The line `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. Since `p` was initially 3, after this operation, `p` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
