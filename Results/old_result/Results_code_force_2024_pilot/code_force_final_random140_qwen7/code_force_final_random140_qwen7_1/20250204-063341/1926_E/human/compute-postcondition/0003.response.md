Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `n` and `k` as inputs from the user and `s` remains 0.
