Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is 3, `d` is 0**

Explanation: The code `d -= (d + 1) // 2` updates the value of `d`. Initially, `d` is 1. The expression `(d + 1) // 2` evaluates to `(1 + 1) // 2`, which is 1. Therefore, `d` is updated to `1 - 1`, resulting in `d` being 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
