Output State: **`i` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `p` is 1, `g` is updated to `(h + 1) // 2`, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The value of `h` is updated to `h - (h + 1) // 2`. Given that `h` was originally `n`, the new value of `h` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
