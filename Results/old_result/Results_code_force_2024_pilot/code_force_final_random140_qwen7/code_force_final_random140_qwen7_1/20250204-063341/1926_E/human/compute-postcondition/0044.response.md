Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are the number of iterations specified by `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run based on the user input.

2. **Determine the User Input**: The user input for the loop is stored in the variable `int(input())`. Let's denote this user input as `user_input`.

3. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is either 4 or 0.
   - `n` is the integer input from the user.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user.
   - `s` is either 4 or 0.
   - `d` is either 1 or `n`.
   - `h` is either `n // 8` or `n`.
   - `p` is either 4 or 1.
   - `g` is either \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\) or 0.
   - `f` is either `k - g` or undefined.
   - `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if `user_input` is greater than 0.
   - Since the loop is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, the loop will run for `user_input` times. After each iteration, `user_input` decreases by 1.

5. **Update the User Input**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `user_input` will be decreased by 1.

Given the above points, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `i` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.
- `k` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.
- `s` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.
- `d` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.
- `h` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.
- `p` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.
- `g` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.
- `f` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.
- `y` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop control.

The only thing that changes is the user input `user_input` which will be decreased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is either 4 or 0, `n` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is either 4 or 0, `d` is either 1 or `n`, `h` is either `n // 8` or `n`, `p` is either 4 or 1, `g` is either \((n + 1) // 2 + (n // 8 + 1) // 2 + (n // 16 + 1) // 2\) or 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined, `user_input` is decreased by 1**.
