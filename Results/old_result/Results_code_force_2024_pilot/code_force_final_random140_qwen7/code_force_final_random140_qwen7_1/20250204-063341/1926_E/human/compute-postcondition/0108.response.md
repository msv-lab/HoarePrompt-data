Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.

3. **Current Values Before the Loop**:
   - `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `p` is 1.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.
   - Since `p` is initially set to 1, `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is at least 2 so that `p` (which is 1) is less than or equal to `i - 1`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure it is at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` remains `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**
