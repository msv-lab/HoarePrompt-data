Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined, and `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\)**
