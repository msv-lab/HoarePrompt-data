Output State: **`h` is now equal to `h // 2`, `p` is `p + 1`, and `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. The other variables (`h` and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `h` is still `h // 2`, `p` is now `p + 1`, and `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`.
