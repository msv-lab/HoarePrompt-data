Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s < k and d > 0`.
2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` must be greater than `(n // 2)`
   - `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`
   - `d` is 1

3. **Check the loop condition**:
   - `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`. Since `d` is 1, `s` is `(1 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
   - `k` must be greater than `(n // 2)`. Since `n` is greater than 1, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 2 (since `n` must be greater than 1). Therefore, `(n // 2)` is `1`. Hence, `k` must be greater than 1.
   - The loop condition is `s < k and d > 0`. We know `s` is 1 and `d` is 1. For the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `k`. To satisfy the condition `s < k and d > 0`, `k` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be greater than 1.

**State**: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is 1, `d` is 1**
