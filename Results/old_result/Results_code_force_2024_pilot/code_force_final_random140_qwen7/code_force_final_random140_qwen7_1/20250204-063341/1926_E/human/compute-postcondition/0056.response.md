Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step:

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `s < k and d > 0`.

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0
- `k` is an integer input from the user
- `s` is \((d + 1) // 2\)
- `d` is now \((n - 1)\)
- `h` is now `n`
- `k` is an integer input from the user
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `f` is either `k - g` or undefined
- `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `s`
- `d`

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `s < k`:**
   - `s` is defined as \((d + 1) // 2\).
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must be less than `k`.
   - Since `s = (d + 1) // 2`, we need \((d + 1) // 2 < k\).

2. **Condition `d > 0`:**
   - `d` is defined as \((n - 1)\).
   - For the loop to continue, `d` must be greater than 0.
   - This means \((n - 1) > 0\) or \(n > 1\).

### Adjusting the States:
- To satisfy the condition `s < k`, we need to ensure that \((d + 1) // 2 < k\). Given that `d = n - 1`, this translates to \(((n - 1) + 1) // 2 < k\) or \((n) // 2 < k\).
- To satisfy the condition `d > 0`, we need \(n > 1\).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than \((n // 2)\)**
