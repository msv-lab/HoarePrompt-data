Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down), `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2; `p` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. None of the other variables (`g`, `h`, `i`, `k`, `n`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state, with the additional information that `p` has been incremented by 1.
