Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2**.

In this case, the initial state does not provide specific values for `g` and `h`. The code updates `g` by adding the integer division of `(h + 1)` by `2` to its current value. Therefore, `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`. The value of `h` remains unchanged, and the value of `g` is updated accordingly.
