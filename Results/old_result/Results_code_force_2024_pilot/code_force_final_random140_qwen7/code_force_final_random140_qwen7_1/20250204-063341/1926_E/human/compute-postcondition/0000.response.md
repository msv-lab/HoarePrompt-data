Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the input values. It is typically not used within the loop body but is necessary for the loop to execute.

2. **Determine the Input Source**: The loop body reads from `input()` and converts it to an integer using `int(input())`. This means that the loop will execute as long as there is input available from the user or the source providing the input.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9\).

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more test cases (i.e., as long as `t` is greater than 0).

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 0.

### Final State Adjustment

- Since `t` is the count of test cases, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The values of `n` and `k` inside each test case are not relevant to the loop condition itself; they will be read inside the loop body.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
