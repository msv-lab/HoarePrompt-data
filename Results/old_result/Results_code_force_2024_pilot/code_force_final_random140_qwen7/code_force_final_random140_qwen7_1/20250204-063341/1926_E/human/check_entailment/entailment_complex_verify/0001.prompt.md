You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations depends on the value of `k` relative to \((n + 1) // 2\).
    #
    #- If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, then:
    #  - `i` will be the number of iterations required for `s` to reach `k`.
    #  - `s` will be exactly `k`.
    #  - `d` will be 0.
    #  - `h` will be 0.
    #  - `p` will be the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach `k`.
    #  - `g` will be the accumulated sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) over all iterations.
    #  - `f` will be `k - g`.
    #  - `y` will be \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\).
    #
    #- If `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, then:
    #  - `i` will remain 0.
    #  - `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y` will all be 0.
    #
    #In both cases, after all iterations, the final value of `y` will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between \( n \), \( k \), and the number of iterations required to reach \( k \). If \( k \) is greater than half of \( n + 1 \), it computes a specific formula involving powers of 2. Otherwise, it simply prints \( 2k - 1 \). The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Variables Initialization:**
   - `s`: Sum of the number of odd cards processed.
   - `i`: Counter for the current multiplier (starting from 1).
   - `d`: Number of odd cards left to be processed at the current multiplier.
   - `h`: Maximum value of the current multiplier.
   - `p`: Counter for the current multiplier.
   - `g`: Sum of the number of even cards processed.
   - `f`: Remaining count after processing the even cards.
   - `y`: The final result (the k-th card).

3. **Odd Card Processing:**
   - The program processes the odd cards first, which is straightforward and correct.

4. **Even Card Processing:**
   - The program tries to handle the even cards by calculating the sum of the number of even cards processed (`s`) and adjusting the remaining cards (`d`).
   - It then processes the even cards in a loop, but the logic seems flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the positions of the even cards.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the position of the k-th card using the formula `2 ** (i - 1) * f`, which is incorrect for determining the actual card number.

### Detailed Issues

1. **Incorrect Logic for Even Cards:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the sum of even cards and their positions.
   - The formula `2 ** (i - 1) * f` does not correctly map to the actual card number.

2. **Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The program fails to correctly handle the cases where `k` is within the range of odd cards or even cards.
   - The logic for processing even cards is not sound and leads to incorrect results.

### Example Analysis

Let's take the example provided:

- For `n = 7` and `k = 6`:
  - The sequence should be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
  - The 6th card is 6, but the program outputs 6, which is correct in this specific case.
- However, for other cases, the program fails to produce the correct output.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
