Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is 3, `d` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. Given that `d` is 1, `(d + 1) // 2` equals 1. So, `s` is updated from 1 to 3. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged.
