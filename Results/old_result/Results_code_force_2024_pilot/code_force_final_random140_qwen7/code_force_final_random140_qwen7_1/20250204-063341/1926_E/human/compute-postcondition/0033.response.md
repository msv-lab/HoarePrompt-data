Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, h is halved towards zero (integer division), p must be less than or equal to i - 2**.

Explanation: The value of `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`. Since `h` is halved towards zero (integer division), its value is updated accordingly. The condition `p must be less than or equal to i - 2` remains unchanged.
