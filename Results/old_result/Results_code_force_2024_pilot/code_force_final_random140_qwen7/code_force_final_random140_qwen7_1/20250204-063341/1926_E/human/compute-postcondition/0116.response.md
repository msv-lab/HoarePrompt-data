To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition and see how the variables involved in the condition change through each iteration.

The loop condition is:
\[ p \leq i - 1 \]

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` must be greater than 3
- `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0
- `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0
- `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration
- `d` is 0
- `h` is now equal to \((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2\)
- `p` is 3
- `g` is doubled from its initial value
- `f` is either `k - g` or undefined
- `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined

The only variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to ensure the loop condition `p <= i - 1` is met for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `p` is 3
- `i` must be greater than 3

For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must remain 3, and `i` must increase such that `p <= i - 1` still holds true. Since `p` is fixed at 3, `i` must be increased by at least 1 to satisfy the condition.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` must be greater than 4.

State: **`i` must be greater than 4, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to \((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2\), `p` is 3, `g` is doubled from its initial value, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined**
