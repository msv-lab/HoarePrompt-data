Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer and must satisfy \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 < k\) and \( n > -1 \), `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `d` must be greater than 0, `s` is \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. The initial value of `s` is \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2\). After executing `s += (d + 1) // 2`, the new value of `s` becomes \(\left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2\). All other variables remain unchanged.
