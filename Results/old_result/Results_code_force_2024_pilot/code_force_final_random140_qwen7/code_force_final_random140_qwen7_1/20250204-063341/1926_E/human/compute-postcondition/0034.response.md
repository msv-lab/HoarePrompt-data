Output State: **`h` is now equal to `h // 2`, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 2`, and `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `h -= (h + 1) // 2` subtracts the value of `(h + 1) // 2` from `h`. This means `h` is now equal to `h // 2`. The other variables `p` and `g` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
