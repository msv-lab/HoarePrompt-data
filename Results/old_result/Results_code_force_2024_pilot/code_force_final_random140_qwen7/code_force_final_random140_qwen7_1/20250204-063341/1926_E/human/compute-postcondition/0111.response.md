Output State: **`i` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of all increments added to `s` during each iteration, `d` is 0, `h` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `p` is 2, `g` is updated to `(h + 1) // 2`, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined.**

Explanation: The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. Initially, `p` was set to 1, so after executing this line, `p` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
