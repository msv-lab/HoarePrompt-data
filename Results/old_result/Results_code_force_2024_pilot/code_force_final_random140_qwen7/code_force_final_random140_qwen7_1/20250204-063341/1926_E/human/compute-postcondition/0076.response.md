Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by (h + 1) // 2, `i` must be at least 3, and `p` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` increases the value of `g` by `(h + 1) // 2`. The value of `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by `(h + 1) // 2`. The condition that `i` must be at least 3 remains unchanged, and `p` is increased by 1.
