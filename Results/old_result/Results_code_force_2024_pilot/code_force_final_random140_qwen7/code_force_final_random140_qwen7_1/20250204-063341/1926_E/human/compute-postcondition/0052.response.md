Let's analyze the loop condition `while s < k and d > 0:`.

- The loop will execute the first time if both conditions `s < k` and `d > 0` are true.
- We need to check the current values of `s` and `d`:
  - `s` is currently 0.
  - `d` is currently `n`.

Given these values:
- For `s < k` to be true, `s` (which is 0) is already less than `k`.
- For `d > 0` to be true, `d` (which is `n`) must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` (the value of `d`), ensuring it is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `s` is 0, `d` is now `n`, `h` is now `n`, `k` is an integer input from the user, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is either `k - g` or undefined, `y` is either \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\) or undefined**
