Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`.
   - `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by `(h + 1) // 2`.
   - `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `n`, and the minimum value between `k` and `n` must be at least 2.
   - `p` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `p` has been increased by 1. Therefore, `p` is now `p_old + 1`, where `p_old` is the value of `p` before the increase.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `p_old + 1` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. This implies that `p_old` must be less than or equal to `i - 2`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `p` was such that `p_old` is less than or equal to `i - 2`. Since `p` is increased by 1, `p_old` must be `p - 1`.
   - Therefore, `p - 1` must be less than or equal to `i - 2`, which simplifies to `p <= i - 1`.

Given the current states, we need to ensure that `p` is such that `p - 1` is less than or equal to `i - 2`. However, since `p` is increased by 1 in each iteration, the critical state to adjust is `i`.

5. **Final adjustment**:
   - `i` must be at least 3 because `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1` and `p` starts from 0 (or some initial value that allows this condition).

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2, `h` is halved (rounded down) and then decreased by (h + 1) // 2, `i` must be at least 3, and `p` is increased by 1**.
