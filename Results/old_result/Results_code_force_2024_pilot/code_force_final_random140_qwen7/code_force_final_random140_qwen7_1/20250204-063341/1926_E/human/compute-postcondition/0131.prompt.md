You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        d = n
        
        h = n
        
        p = 1
        
        g = 0
        
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * f
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations depends on the value of `k` relative to \((n + 1) // 2\).
    #
    #- If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, then:
    #  - `i` will be the number of iterations required for `s` to reach `k`.
    #  - `s` will be exactly `k`.
    #  - `d` will be 0.
    #  - `h` will be 0.
    #  - `p` will be the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach `k`.
    #  - `g` will be the accumulated sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) over all iterations.
    #  - `f` will be `k - g`.
    #  - `y` will be \(2^{(i - 1)} * (k - g)\).
    #
    #- If `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, then:
    #  - `i` will remain 0.
    #  - `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y` will all be 0.
    #
    #In both cases, after all iterations, the final value of `y` will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within specific ranges (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. It returns a value based on the relationship between `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
