Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0 and divisible by 4, `k` must be greater than 2, `s` is 3, `d` is `n // 4`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. Given that `d` is `n // 4`, `s` is initially 2, and `d` is `n // 4`, the calculation becomes `s += (n // 4 + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is divisible by 4, `n // 4` is an integer, and `(n // 4 + 1) // 2` simplifies to `(d + 1) // 2`. This results in `s` being updated to `2 + (d + 1) // 2`. Given that `d` is `n // 4`, the new value of `s` is `3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
