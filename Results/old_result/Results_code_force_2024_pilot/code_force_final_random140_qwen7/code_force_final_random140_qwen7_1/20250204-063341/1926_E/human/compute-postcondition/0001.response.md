Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer**.

This means that the code reads two integers from the user input, separated by a space, and converts them into integers, assigning the first one to `n` and the second one to `k`. No other variables are affected, so their initial state remains unchanged.
