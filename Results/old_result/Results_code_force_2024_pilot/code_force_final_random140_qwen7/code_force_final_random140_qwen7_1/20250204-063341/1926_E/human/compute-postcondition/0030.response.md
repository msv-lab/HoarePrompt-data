Output State: **`g` is increased by (h + 1) // 2; h is halved towards zero (integer division)**

Explanation: Initially, `g` is increased by `(h + 1) // 2`. This means `g` has a specific value based on the initial value of `h`. After that, the code subtracts `(h + 1) // 2` from `h`, which effectively halves `h` towards zero (since integer division truncates towards zero). Therefore, `h` is updated to its new value, which is half of its original value plus one, truncated towards zero. The value of `g` remains unchanged from its initial state, as no further operations are performed on it.
