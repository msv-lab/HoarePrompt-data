Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`). For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is at least 0.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, the values of `i`, `n`, `hashing[a[i]]`, and `ans` remain as they were after the increase by `i`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs until `i < n - 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be `n - 2` (because `i` will increment to `n - 1` in the next iteration).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `hashing[a[i]]` and `ans` may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, but since we don't know the exact values, we keep them as they were after the last update.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is at least 1**
