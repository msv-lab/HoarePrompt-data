Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6, and if `a[6]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[6]]` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The code increments `i` by 1, so `i` changes from 5 to 6. The condition for `n` remains the same, i.e., `n` must be greater than 6. The line `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing[a[6]]` by adding the current value of `i` (which is 6) to the existing value of `hashing[a[6]]`. If `a[6]` was not already in `hashing`, it is now added with a value of 0, and then 6 is added to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
