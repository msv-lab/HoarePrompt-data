Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list with the first three elements from `data` starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, and `current_index` is increased by 3; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `current_index` remain unchanged from their initial states.
