Output State: **`a` remains the same list of integers, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `a` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `hashing` is updated such that the key `a[i]` (where `i` is now `i + 1`) is set to 0. All other variables remain in their initial state.
