Output State: **`current_index` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[4])], `i` is 0**.

The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. The values of `t`, `n`, `results`, `hashing`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
