Output State: **`i` is -1, `current_index` is `current_index + n`, `a` is a list containing all elements from `data` starting from `current_index - n` to `current_index - 1`.**

Explanation: The loop runs `n` times, and with each iteration, `i` decreases by 1 (starting from `n-1`), and `current_index` increases by 1. After `n` iterations, `i` will become `-1`. During these iterations, the list `a` is populated with elements from `data` starting from the index `current_index - n` up to `current_index - 1`.
