Output State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed. The variable `i` is now `n - 1`. The `hashing` dictionary contains the sum of indices for each unique element in the list `a` up to `i`. The variable `ans` is the cumulative sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are consecutive in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `i` will be `n - 1`, as the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`.
- The `hashing` dictionary will contain the sum of indices for each unique element in the list `a` up to the last index processed (`i = n - 2`).
- The variable `ans` will be the total sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal.
- The list `a` itself will remain unaltered throughout the process.
