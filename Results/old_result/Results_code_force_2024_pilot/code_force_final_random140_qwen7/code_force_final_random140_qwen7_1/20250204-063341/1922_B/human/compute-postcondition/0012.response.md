Output State: **`current_index` is 5, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is [int(data[4])], `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends `int(data[current_index])` to the list `a`. Initially, `current_index` is 4, so `int(data[4])` is appended to `a`, making `a` equal to `[int(data[4])]`. After appending, `current_index` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
