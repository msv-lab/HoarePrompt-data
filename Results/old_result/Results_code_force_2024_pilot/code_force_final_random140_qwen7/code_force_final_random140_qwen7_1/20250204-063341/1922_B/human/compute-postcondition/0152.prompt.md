Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in the `results` list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration. Specifically, `results` will contain the values of `ans` calculated after each iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` after the final iteration, indicating that the innermost loop has processed all elements in the list `a`. The `hashing` dictionary will be empty since it is reinitialized at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `ans` will hold the final cumulative sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are consecutive in the list `a` across all iterations. The list `a` will be fully processed, and `current_index` will reflect the total number of elements processed, which is the sum of `n` for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `result` is the first element of the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `result` is the second element of the `results` list, `results` must contain at least two elements

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `result` is the third element of the `results` list, `results` must contain at least two elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
