Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_index` is `current_index + 1`, `a` is a list with the element `data[current_index]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `data[current_index]` (converted to an integer) to the list `a`. The values of `i` and `current_index` remain unchanged from their initial states, but now `a` contains an additional element.
