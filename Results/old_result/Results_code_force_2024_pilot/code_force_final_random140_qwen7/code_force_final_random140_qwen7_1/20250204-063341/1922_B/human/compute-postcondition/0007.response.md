Output State: **`current_index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

The code creates an empty dictionary named `hashing`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
