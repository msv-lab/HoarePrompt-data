Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a` such that `i` is `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `n - 1`, `hashing` is a set of integers where the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is now `i`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by `i`. Given the initial state, `hashing[a[i]]` was initially 0, so after executing the line, its value becomes `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
