Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The variable `n` will still be greater than or equal to 3. The list `a` will contain integers starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` as it did after the third iteration, but now `current_index` will be increased by 3 for each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`. The dictionary `hashing` will have keys corresponding to elements in `a` up to `a[n-2]`, with their respective values updated according to the loop's logic. The variable `ans` will be the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all consecutive equal elements found in `a` during the loop's execution.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has run through all its iterations, based on the given initial and intermediate states.
