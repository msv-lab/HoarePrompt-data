Output State: **`current_index` is 4, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]`, and `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is an empty list.**

The code `a = []` creates an empty list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
