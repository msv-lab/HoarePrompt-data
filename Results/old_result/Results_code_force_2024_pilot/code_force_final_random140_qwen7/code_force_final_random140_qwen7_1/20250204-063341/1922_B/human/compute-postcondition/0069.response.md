Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - From the given state, `i` is initially 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - Since `i` starts at 3, for the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 3, which means `n` must be greater than 4.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and run. Therefore, we need to adjust the values of `i` and `n` such that the loop condition is satisfied.
   - Since `i` is already 3, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 4 to allow the loop to start.

5. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `i` should remain 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 4 to allow the loop to start.

Given these considerations, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4**.
