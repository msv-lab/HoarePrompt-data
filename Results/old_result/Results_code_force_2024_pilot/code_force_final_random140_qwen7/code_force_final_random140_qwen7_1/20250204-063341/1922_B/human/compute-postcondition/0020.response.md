Output State: `current_index` is 12, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is `[int(data[4]), int(data[6]), int(data[9]), int(data[11])]`, `i` is 3.

This output state is calculated by observing the pattern from the given states after each iteration. The loop continues until `i` equals `n-1`. Since the loop has executed 3 times so far, it means `n` must be 4 (as `i` will be 3 when the loop finishes). Therefore, the loop will execute a total of 4 times. After 4 iterations, `current_index` will be `4 + 4 * 2 = 12` because `current_index` increases by 1 in each iteration. The list `a` will contain the integers from `data[4]` to `data[11]` (inclusive), and `i` will be 3.
