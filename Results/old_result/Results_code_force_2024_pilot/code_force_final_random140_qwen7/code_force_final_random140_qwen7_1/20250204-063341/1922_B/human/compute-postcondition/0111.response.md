Output State: **`i` is `n`, `current_index` is `current_index + 3`, `a` is a list with the elements `data[current_index - 1]` and `int(data[current_index])` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` was `current_index + 2`. After the increment, `current_index` becomes `current_index + 3`. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
