Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 0, and `ans` is equal to 4. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then the function does nothing.
