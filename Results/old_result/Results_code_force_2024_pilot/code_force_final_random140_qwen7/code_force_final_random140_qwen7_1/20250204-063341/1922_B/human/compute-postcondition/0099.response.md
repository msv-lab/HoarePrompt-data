Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `current_index` is increased by 3, the list `a` contains integers starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, the dictionary `hashing` is empty, the variable `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all consecutive equal elements found in `a` during the loop's execution, and the variable `results` is appended with the value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the dictionary `hashing` to an empty dictionary. All other variables and lists remain unchanged from their initial states.
