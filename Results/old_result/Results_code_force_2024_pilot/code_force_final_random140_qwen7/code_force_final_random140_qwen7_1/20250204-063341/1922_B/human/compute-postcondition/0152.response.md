Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in the `results` list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration. Specifically, `results` will contain the values of `ans` calculated after each iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` after the final iteration, indicating that the innermost loop has processed all elements in the list `a`. The `hashing` dictionary will be empty since it is reinitialized at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `ans` will hold the final cumulative sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are consecutive in the list `a` across all iterations. The list `a` will be fully processed, and `current_index` will reflect the total number of elements processed, which is the sum of `n` for each iteration.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the `results` list will contain all the intermediate sums of `ans` calculated during each iteration. The variable `i` will indicate that the processing of the list `a` is complete, with `i` being `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the current segment of `a` being processed in the last iteration. The `hashing` dictionary will be empty as it gets reset at the beginning of each iteration. The `ans` variable will hold the total sum of the counts of consecutive elements that were found to be the same across different segments of `a`. The `current_index` will reflect the total number of elements processed, which is the sum of `n` for each iteration.
