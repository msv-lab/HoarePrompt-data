Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 0, and `ans` is equal to 4. If the element at index `i` of `a` is equal to the element at index `i + 1` of `a`, then the condition is met and `ans` remains 4. If the condition is not met, `ans` still remains 4.
