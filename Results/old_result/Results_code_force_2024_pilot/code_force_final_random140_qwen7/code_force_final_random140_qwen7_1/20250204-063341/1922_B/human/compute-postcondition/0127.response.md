Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `n` is at least 1; `hashing[a[i]]` is 0**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `0` to `hashing[a[i]]`. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `n` is at least 1, the value of `i` remains `n - 1`. The `hashing` dictionary now contains the key `a[i]` with the value `0`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
