Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is a list with one element which is `int(data[current_index])`.
   - `current_index` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0 (since `n` does not change within the loop).

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The state of `a` and `current_index` does not affect the loop condition and thus does not need to be updated for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with one element which is `int(data[current_index])`, `current_index` is incremented by 1**.
