The only objects in the loop head are the variables `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute again, the `results` list must contain at least two elements because the loop is iterating over each element of the list starting from the second element.

At the end of the last iteration, `result` is the first element of the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `result` will be set to the second element of the `results` list, and `results` must still contain at least two elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`result` is the second element of the `results` list, `results` must contain at least two elements**
