Output State: **`a` remains the same list of integers, `i` is now `i + 1`; `hashing[a[i]]` is set to `i`**.

Explanation: The code increments `i` by 1 and then adds the current value of `i` to the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Since `a[i]` was not previously in `hashing`, it is set to 0 initially, and then `i` is added to it, making `hashing[a[i]]` equal to `i`. The list `a` and the original value of `i` (before increment) remain unchanged.
