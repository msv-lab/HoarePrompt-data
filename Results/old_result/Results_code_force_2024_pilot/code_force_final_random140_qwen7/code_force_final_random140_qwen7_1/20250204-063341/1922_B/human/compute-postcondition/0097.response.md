Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, the variable `n` is still greater than or equal to 3, the list `a` contains integers starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` as it did after the third iteration, but now `current_index` is increased by 3 for each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`, the dictionary `hashing` has keys corresponding to elements in `a` up to `a[n-2]`, with their respective values updated according to the loop's logic, the variable `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all consecutive equal elements found in `a` during the loop's execution, and the variable `results` is appended with the value of `ans`.**

This means that after the loop completes, the `results` list is updated with the final value of `ans`, which is the sum of the hashed values for consecutive equal elements in the list `a`. All other conditions and values remain as they were before the loop, except for the updated value of `i` and the appended `results` list.
