Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values of these variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]` and must be greater than 0.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.

5. **Determine the new value of `n`**:
   - `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is `data[2]` and must be greater than 0.

6. **List the updated states**:
   - `current_index` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `results` remains an empty list.
   - `hashing` remains an empty dictionary.
   - `a` remains `[int(data[4]), int(data[6])]`.
   - `i` is now 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`current_index` is 8, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is `[int(data[4]), int(data[6])]`, `i` is 2**
