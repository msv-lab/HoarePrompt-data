Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_index` is 12, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]` and must be greater than 3, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is `[int(data[12]), int(data[14]), int(data[17]), int(data[19])] sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `hashing` is a set of integers where the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `a[i + 1]`, the values of `a`, `i`, `hashing`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a` such that `i` is `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `n - 1`, `hashing` is a set of integers where the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is now `i`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` remains the same list of integers, `i` is now `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
