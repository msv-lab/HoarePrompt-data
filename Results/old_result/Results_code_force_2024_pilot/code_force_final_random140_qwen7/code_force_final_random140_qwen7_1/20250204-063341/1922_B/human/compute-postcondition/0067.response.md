Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list with the first three elements from `data` starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, and `current_index` is increased by 3.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` initially contains the elements `int(data[current_index-2])`, `int(data[current_index-1])`, and `int(data[current_index])`, after sorting, `a` will be a sorted list of these three elements. The values of `n`, `i`, and `current_index` remain unchanged from their initial states, but `a` is now sorted.
