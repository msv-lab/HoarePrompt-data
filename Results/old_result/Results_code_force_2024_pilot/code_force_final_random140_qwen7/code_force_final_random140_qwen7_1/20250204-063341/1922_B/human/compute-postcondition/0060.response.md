Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is `int(data[current_index-1])` and the second element is `int(data[current_index])`, `current_index` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code appends `int(data[current_index])` to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one element, which is `int(data[current_index-1])`. After appending, `a` now contains two elements: the first element remains `int(data[current_index-1])`, and the second element is `int(data[current_index])`. Additionally, `current_index` is incremented by 1. The conditions and values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
