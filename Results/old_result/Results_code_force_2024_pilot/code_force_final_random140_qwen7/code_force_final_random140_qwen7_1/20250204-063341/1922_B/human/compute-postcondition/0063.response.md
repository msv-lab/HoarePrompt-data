Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list with an additional element which is the integer value of `data[current_index]`.**

The code appends the integer value of `data[current_index]` to the list `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `a`, we only know that after the operation, `a` will have one more element, which is the integer value of `data[current_index]`. The conditions on `n` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
