Output State: **`data[current_index]` is assigned to `n`, `hashing` dictionary is empty, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are consecutive in the list `a`, the list `a` remains unchanged, the `results` list has appended the current value of `ans`, `current_index` is increased by 1, and `t` must be greater than 0, and the list `a` is now an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `a` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `data[current_index]`, `n`, `hashing`, `ans`, `results`, `current_index`, or `t`. However, it sets `a` to an empty list. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.
