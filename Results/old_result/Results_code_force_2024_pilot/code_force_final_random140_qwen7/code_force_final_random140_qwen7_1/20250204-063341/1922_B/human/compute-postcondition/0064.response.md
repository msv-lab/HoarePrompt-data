Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `current_index` is increased by 1.**

The code `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Since `current_index` was previously unspecified in the initial state, after the increment, its new value is simply one more than whatever it was before. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
