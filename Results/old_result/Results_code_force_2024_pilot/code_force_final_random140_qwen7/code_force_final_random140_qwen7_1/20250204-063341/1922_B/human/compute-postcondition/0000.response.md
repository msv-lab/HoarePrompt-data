Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5; the input function is replaced by `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` changes the way input is read from standard input to using `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input as a single string. However, it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list of integers. Therefore, these values remain as initially stated, and only the method of reading input is updated.
