Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 1, `hashing[a[i]]` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by `i`. Initially, `i` is `n - 1`. After executing the line `hashing[a[i]] += i`, `i` is decremented by 1 (as per the typical behavior of a loop that starts from `n-1` and goes down), making `i` equal to `n - 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `hashing[a[i]]` is now equal to `i`, which is `n - 1` before the decrement.
