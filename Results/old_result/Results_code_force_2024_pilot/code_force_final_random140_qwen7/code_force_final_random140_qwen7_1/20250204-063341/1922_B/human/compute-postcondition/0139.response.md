Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `hashing[a[i]]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is updated to `i + 1` if `a[i]` is not already in `hashing`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`, and if `a[i]` was not previously in `hashing`, its entry in `hashing` has been updated to `i + 1`. The values of `i` and the previous state of `ans` remain unchanged.
