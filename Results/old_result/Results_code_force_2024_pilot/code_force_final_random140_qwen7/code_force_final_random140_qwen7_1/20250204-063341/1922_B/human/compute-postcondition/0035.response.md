Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a` such that `i` is `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `n - 1`, `hashing` is a set of integers where the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to 0. This changes the value of `hashing` at the key `a[i]` to 0. The values of `a`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
