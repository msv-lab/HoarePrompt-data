Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with one element which is `int(data[current_index])` and `current_index` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from the original to `current_index + 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
