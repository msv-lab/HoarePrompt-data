Postcondition: `i` is at least 0, `n` is at least 1, `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`, and if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, the values of `i`, `n`, `hashing[a[i]]`, and `ans` remain as they were after the increase by `i`.
