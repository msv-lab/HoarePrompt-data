Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Triangle Inequality Check**: The solution does not actually check if the three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. It only counts the number of occurrences of each stick length and uses this count to calculate something that is not relevant to forming a triangle.

2. **Sorting and Counting**: While sorting the sticks might seem like a step towards solving the problem, the counting method used afterward does not help in determining which sets of three sticks can form a triangle.

3. **Triangle Inequality Principle Not Applied**: The core logic of checking if three sides can form a triangle (i.e., the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side) is missing.

### Correct Solution Outline:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Sort the list of stick lengths.
- Use three nested loops to try every combination of three sticks.
- For each combination, check if they satisfy the triangle inequality principle.
- Count the valid combinations.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    current_index = 0
    t = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[current_index])
        current_index += 1
        a = [int(data[current_index + i]) for i in range(n)]
        a.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            k = i + 2
            for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
                while k < n and a[i] + a[j] > a[k]:
                    k += 1
                ans += k - j - 1
        results.append(ans)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_1()
```

This solution correctly checks every combination of three sticks and applies the triangle inequality principle to count valid triangles.
