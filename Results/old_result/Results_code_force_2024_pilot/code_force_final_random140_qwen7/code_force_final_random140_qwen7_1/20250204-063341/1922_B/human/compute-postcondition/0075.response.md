Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 3.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value in the dictionary `hashing` corresponding to the key `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3 and the element at index 3 of `a` is 0, the line `hashing[a[i]] += i` translates to `hashing[0] += 3`. Since the initial value of `hashing[0]` was 0, after executing this line, `hashing[0]` becomes 3. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
