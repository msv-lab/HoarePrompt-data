Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `hashing` is a set of integers where the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `0` to the key `a[i]` in the set `hashing`. Since `a[i]` is not in the set before this operation, after executing the line `hashing[a[i]] = 0`, the set `hashing` now contains the key `a[i]` with the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
