Output State: **`current_index` is 7, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is `[int(data[4]), int(data[6])]`, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The code appends `int(data[current_index])` to the list `a`. Since `current_index` is initially 6, `int(data[6])` is appended to `a`, making `a` equal to `[int(data[4]), int(data[6])]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
