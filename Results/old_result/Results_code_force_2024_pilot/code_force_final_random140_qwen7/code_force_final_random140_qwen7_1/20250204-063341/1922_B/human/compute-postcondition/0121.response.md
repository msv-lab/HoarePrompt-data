Output State: **`i` is at least 0; `n` is at least 1; `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by adding `i` to its current value. Since `a[i]` is not specified to be in `hashing` initially, it is added with a value of 0 before the addition. The conditions that `i` is at least 0 and `n` is at least 1 remain unchanged.
