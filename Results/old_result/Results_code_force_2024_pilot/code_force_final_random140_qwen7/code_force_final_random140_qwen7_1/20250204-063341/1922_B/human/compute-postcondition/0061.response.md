Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is `int(data[current_index-1])` and the second element is `int(data[current_index])`, `current_index` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
