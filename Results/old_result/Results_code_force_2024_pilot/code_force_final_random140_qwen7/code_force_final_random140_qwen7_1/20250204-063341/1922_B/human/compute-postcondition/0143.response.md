Output State: **`results` contains the value of `ans`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` contains the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for each `i` where `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is updated based on the index `i` for each unique element encountered in the list `a` up to the second last element.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `results`. This does not change the values of `i` or `ans`, nor does it affect the updates made to the `hashing` dictionary. Therefore, these values remain as described in the initial state.
