Postcondition: **`res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd); `i` is incremented by 1; `remain` is set to `mid - b[i]`; `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`; `s` is set to `f[j - 1] + b[i]` regardless of whether `j == k` or not.**
