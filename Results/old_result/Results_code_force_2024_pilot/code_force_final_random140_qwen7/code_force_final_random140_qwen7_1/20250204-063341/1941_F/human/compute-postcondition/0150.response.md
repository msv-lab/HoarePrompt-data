Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`, `s` is updated to `f[j] + b[i]`, `j` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`**.

Explanation: 
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`.
- The value of `remain` is `mid - b[3]`.
- The value of `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`.
- The value of `s` is updated to `f[j] + b[i]`.
- The value of `j` is reassigned to the value of `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`.
