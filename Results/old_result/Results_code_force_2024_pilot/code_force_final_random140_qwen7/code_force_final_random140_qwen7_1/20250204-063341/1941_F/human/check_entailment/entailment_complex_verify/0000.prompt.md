You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `res` will hold the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop iterations, where each update is the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, with `s` being either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` equals `k` or `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k` and `j >= 1`. If no valid `s` is found that satisfies `start < s < end`, `res` will remain infinity (`inf`). The values of `end`, `start`, `nd`, `mid`, `b`, `f`, `k`, and `j` will remain unchanged from their initial or previous states within the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, m, k, a (a sorted list of n integers), d (a list of m integers), and f (a list of k integers). For each test case, it calculates and returns the minimum value among all possible updates. Each update is determined by finding a value s such that start < s < end, where start and end are derived from the list a, and s is either f[j - 1] + b[i] or f[j] + b[i]. If no valid s is found, it returns the maximum gap value from the list a.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the new problem's complexity could potentially reduce the maximum gap between consecutive elements in the sorted list of problem complexities. Specifically, the program does not consider all possible combinations of the new problem's complexity derived from the models and functions. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5 5 5
5 10 15 20 26
11 14 16 13 8
16 4 5 3 1
```

The current implementation only checks the gaps after sorting and does not explore all possible new problem complexities that could be formed by combining models and functions. This leads to missing potential improvements in the imbalance. For example, the combination of `d_1 = 11` and `f_1 = 1` results in a new complexity of `12`, which could potentially reduce the gap between `10` and `15`. The program should consider all such combinations to ensure the minimum possible imbalance is found.
