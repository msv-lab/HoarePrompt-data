Postcondition: `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`, `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `j` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`. This is because if `start < s < end` holds true, `res` is updated accordingly; otherwise, no change occurs as there is no else part.
