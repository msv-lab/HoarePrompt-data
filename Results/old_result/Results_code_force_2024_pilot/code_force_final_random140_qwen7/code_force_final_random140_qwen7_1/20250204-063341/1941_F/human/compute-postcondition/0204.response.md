Postcondition: **`res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.** 

This means that regardless of whether the condition `start < s < end` is true or false (in this case, it's always true as per the if part), the value of `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of the differences `end - s` and `s - start`, and the value `nd`.
