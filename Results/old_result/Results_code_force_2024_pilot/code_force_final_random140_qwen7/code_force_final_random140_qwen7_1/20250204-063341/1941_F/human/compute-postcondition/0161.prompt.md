Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is set to infinity (inf), `gap` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a`; `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`; `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`; `mid` is the average of `start` and `end` rounded down to the nearest integer; `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise the first element of the second tuple in `gap`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, and `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`. If `s` is not between `start` and `end`, the value of `res` remains unchanged. Here, `s` is defined as `f[k - 1] + b[0]` when `j == k`, and as `f[j] + b[i]` or `f[j - 1] + b[i]` when `j != k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`. If `s` is not between `start` and `end`, the value of `res` remains unchanged. Here, `s` is defined as `f[j - 1] + b[1]` if `j != k`, and as `f[j - 1] + b[1]` since `j != k` (assuming `k` was previously defined). If `j == k`, `s` is set to `f[j - 1] + b[1]`. If `j` is at least 1, `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[2]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`. In both cases (if and else), `j` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`. If `j == k`, `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`; otherwise, `s` is updated to `f[j] + b[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
