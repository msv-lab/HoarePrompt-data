Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `remain` is `mid - b[m-1]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in the list `b`, `res` is the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop iterations, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `b` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `f` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `f = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts each element into an integer. It then stores these integers in the list `f`. The values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, `res`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and the original `b` list remain unchanged.
