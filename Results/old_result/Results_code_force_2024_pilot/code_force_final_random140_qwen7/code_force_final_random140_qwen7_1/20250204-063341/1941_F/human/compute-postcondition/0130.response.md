Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`. If `s` is not between `start` and `end`, the value of `res` remains unchanged. Here, `s` is defined as `f[j - 1] + b[1]`, and `s` is set to `f[j - 1] + b[1]` since `j != k` (assuming `k` was previously defined).**

This postcondition summarizes that `i` remains 1, `m` remains greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, and `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`. If `s` is not between `start` and `end`, `res` remains unchanged. The value of `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[1]` and `j` is assigned based on the condition `j != k`.
