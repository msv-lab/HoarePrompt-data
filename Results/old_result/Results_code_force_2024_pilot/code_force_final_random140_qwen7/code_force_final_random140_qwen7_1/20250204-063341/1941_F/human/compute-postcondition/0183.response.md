Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable mentioned in the loop head is `i`, and the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.

3. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`nd`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `b`, and `res`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself. However, they might influence the loop's behavior, but since the question specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, these variables remain as they are.

4. **Final State Adjustment**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly is the initial value of `i`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should include the initial value of `i`:

**State: **`i` is 0**
