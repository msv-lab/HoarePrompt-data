Postcondition: `i` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - (f[j] + b[3]), f[j] + b[3] - start, nd)`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - (f[j - 1] + b[3]), f[j - 1] + b[3] - start, nd)`.
