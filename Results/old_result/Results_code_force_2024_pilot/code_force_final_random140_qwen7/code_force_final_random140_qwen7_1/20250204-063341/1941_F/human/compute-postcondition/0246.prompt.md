Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 \cdot 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. The list d contains m integers such that 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9. The list f contains k integers such that 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]
    a = [*map(int, input().split())]
    b = [*map(int, input().split())]
    f = [*map(int, input().split())]
    gap = [(y - x, x, y) for y, x in zip(a[1:], a)]
    gap.sort(reverse=True)
    start = gap[0][1]
    end = gap[0][2]
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    nd = 0 if len(gap) == 1 else gap[1][0]
    b.sort()
    f.sort()
    res = inf
    for i in range(m):
        remain = mid - b[i]
        j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
        if j == k:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        else:
            s = f[j] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
            if j >= 1:
                s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
                if start < s < end:
                    res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    if res == inf:
        print(gap[0][0])
    else:
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `m` remains unchanged from its initial value. The variable `remain` will hold the value of `mid - b[m-1]`. The variable `j` will be the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in the list `f`. The variable `res` will be the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop iterations, where each update is the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, with `s` being either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` equals `k` or `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k` and `j >= 1`. If `res` was updated during the loop, `res` will be the minimum of those updates; otherwise, `res` will remain infinity (`inf`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` equals `m`, `res` holds either the minimum value found during all iterations according to the logic inside the loop or infinity, and `j`, `remain`, `s`, and `nd` reflect their final states after processing all elements in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the execution of the if-else block, `res` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd) for each iteration, where `s` is calculated based on the bisect operations on list `f`. The variable `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `end`, `start`, `nd`, `mid`, `b`, `f`, `k`, and `j` will remain unchanged from their initial or previous states within the loop body. If `res` is initially infinity, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is updated to the minimum value as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
