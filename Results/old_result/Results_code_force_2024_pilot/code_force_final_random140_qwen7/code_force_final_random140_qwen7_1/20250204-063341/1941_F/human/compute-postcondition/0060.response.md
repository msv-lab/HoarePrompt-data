Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`, `j` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`**.

This means that the variable `j` now holds the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`, which is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in the list `f`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values.
