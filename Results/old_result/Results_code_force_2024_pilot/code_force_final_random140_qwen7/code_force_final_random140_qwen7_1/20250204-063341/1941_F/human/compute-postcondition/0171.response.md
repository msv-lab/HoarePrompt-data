Output State: **`a` is a list containing integers from the input split and mapped to a list, `n`, `m`, and `k` are no longer individual variables but elements within the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes the input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. As a result, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` no longer hold their original values individually but are part of the list `a`.
