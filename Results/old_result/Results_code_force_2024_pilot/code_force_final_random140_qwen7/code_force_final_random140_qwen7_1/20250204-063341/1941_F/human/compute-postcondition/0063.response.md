Postcondition: `i` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`, where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[3]`. This holds true whether the condition `start < s < end` is satisfied or not, as there is no else part to modify the postcondition when the condition is not met.
