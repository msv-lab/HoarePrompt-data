Postcondition: `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` equals `k`, `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[0]`, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, and `res` is assigned the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`. If `s` is not between `start` and `end`, the value of `res` remains unchanged.
