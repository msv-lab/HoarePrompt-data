Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`, `s` is updated to `f[j] + b[i]`, `j` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement, as there is no else part in the given code snippet. The conditions and updates mentioned in the if part directly apply to the final state of the program.
