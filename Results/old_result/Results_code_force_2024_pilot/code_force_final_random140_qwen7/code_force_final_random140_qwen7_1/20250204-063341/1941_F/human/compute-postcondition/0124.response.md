Postcondition: `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, and `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`. If `s` is not between `start` and `end`, the value of `res` remains unchanged. Here, `s` is defined as `f[k - 1] + b[0]` when `j == k`, and as `f[j] + b[i]` or `f[j - 1] + b[i]` when `j != k`.
