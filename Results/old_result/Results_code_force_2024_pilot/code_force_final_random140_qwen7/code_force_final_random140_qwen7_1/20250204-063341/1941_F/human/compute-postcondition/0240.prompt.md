Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is equal to `gap[1][0]`; `start` is equal to the first element of the tuple in `gap` which has the largest difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the corresponding elements in `a`; `end` is equal to `gap[0][2]`; `mid` is equal to (`start` + `end`) // 2; `b` is sorted; `res` is infinity.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd). This holds true regardless of whether `j == k` or not, as the else part does not specify any additional actions that would change the postcondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd); `i` is incremented by 1; `remain` is set to `mid - b[i]`; `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`; `s` is set to `f[j - 1] + b[i]` regardless of whether `j == k` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd); `i` is incremented by 1; `remain` is equal to `mid - b[i]`; `m` remains the same; `end`, `s`, `start`, `nd`, `mid`, `b`, `f`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged; `j` is assigned the value of the leftmost index in list `f` where the first argument is greater than or equal to `remain`; `s` is updated to either `f[j] + b[i]` or `f[j - 1] + b[i]` depending on whether `j` is greater than or equal to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
