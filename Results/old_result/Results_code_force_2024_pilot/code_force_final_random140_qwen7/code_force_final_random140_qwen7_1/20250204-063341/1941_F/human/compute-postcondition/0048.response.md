Postcondition: `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, where `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` equals `k` or `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k` and `j >= 1`, and `s` is set to `f[j] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is further updated to the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`.
