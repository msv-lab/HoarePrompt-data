Output State: **`a` is the same list as before, `b` is the same list as `a`, `f` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `gap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the corresponding elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `gap` using a list comprehension. Each element in `gap` is a tuple `(y - x, x, y)` where `y` and `x` are consecutive elements from the list `a`. The lists `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
