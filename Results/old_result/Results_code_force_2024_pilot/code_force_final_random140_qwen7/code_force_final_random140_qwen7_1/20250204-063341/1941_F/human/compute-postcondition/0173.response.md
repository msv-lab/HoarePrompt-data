Output State: **`a` is the same list as before, `b` is the same list as `a`, `f` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `f = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `f`. Since `b` was defined as the same list as `a` in the initial state, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `f` is updated to the new list of integers obtained from the input.
