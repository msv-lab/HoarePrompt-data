Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input split and mapped to a list.**

The code takes an input, splits it into multiple parts, and maps each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the exact values are not specified in the initial state, we only know that these variables are now holding integer values from the input.
