Postcondition: **The variable `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `m` remains unchanged from its initial value. The variable `remain` will hold the value of `mid - b[m-1]`. The variable `j` will be the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in the list `f`. The variable `res` will be infinity (`inf`), as no updates were made during the loop iterations.**
