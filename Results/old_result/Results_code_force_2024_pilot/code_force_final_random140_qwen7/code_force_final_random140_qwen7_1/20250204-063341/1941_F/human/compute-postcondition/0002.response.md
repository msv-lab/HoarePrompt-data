Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, and `k` is the third integer entered; `a` is a list containing three integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes a line of input split by spaces and converts each element to an integer, storing them in a list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
