Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, and `k` is the third integer entered; `a` is a list containing three integers converted from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
