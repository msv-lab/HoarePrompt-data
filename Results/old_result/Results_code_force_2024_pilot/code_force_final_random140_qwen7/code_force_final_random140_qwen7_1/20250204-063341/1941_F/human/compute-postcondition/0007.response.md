Output State: **`start` is equal to `gap[0][1]`, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, and `k` is the third integer entered; `a` is a list of three integers converted from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `f` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces; `gap` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing (y - x, x, y), where (x, y) are consecutive elements from the list `a`, and `gap` is sorted in descending order.**

In this output state, the variable `start` is assigned the value of `gap[0][1]`, which is the second element of the first tuple in the sorted list `gap`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
