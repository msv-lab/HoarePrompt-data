Based on the initial state described:

- The list `p` contains all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a`.
- `i` is the last even number added to the list, which is `a`.

Since `i` is the last even number added to the list `p` and is equal to `a`, and considering `a` itself must be an even number (as `i` is the last even number added), the list `p` will contain all even numbers starting from 2 up to and including `a`.

When the `print(*p)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 4 6 ... a** (where `a` is the last even number in the list)
