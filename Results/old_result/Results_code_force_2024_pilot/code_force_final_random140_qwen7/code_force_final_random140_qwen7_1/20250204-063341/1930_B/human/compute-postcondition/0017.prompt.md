Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `p` will contain all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a`, and `i` will be the last even number added to the list, which is `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
    p += [i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the largest even number less than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the next odd number less than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i` from the previous iteration and now includes `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next odd number after the previous value of `i`, `p` is a list containing the previous value of `i` and the new value of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
