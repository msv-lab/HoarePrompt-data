Output State: **`i` is the next odd number after the previous value of `i`, `p` is a list containing the previous value of `i` and the new value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is defined to be the next odd number after its previous value, this relationship remains unchanged. The list `p` now includes both the previous value of `i` and the newly appended value of `i`.
