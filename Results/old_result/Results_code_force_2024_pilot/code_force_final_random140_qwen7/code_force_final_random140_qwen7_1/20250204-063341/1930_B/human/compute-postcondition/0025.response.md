Output State: **`p` is a list containing the previous value of `i` plus the current value of `i`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, and `a` must still be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. This means that `p` now contains the previous value of `i` (let's call it `i_prev`) and the current value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 2`). The value of `i` is updated to `i_prev + 2`, and the condition that `a` must still be at least 2 remains unchanged.
