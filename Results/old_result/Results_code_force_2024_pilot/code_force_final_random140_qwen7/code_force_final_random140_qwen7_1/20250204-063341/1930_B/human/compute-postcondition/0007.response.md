Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(2, a + 1, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is a list containing the values [8, 8]
   - `i` is 8

3. **Determine the value of `a`**: Since `i` is currently 8 and the loop increments by 2 each time, the possible values for `a` that would allow `i` to reach 8 are 8 or 10 (if the loop had executed one more time). However, since the loop has just ended, `a` must be 8 (because if `a` were 10, `i` would still be within the range).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2 from its current value of 8, so `i` will be 10.
   - `a` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the range, so `a` is still 8.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `p` remains unchanged: `[8, 8]`
   - `i` is now 10
   - `a` is still 8

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`p` is a list containing the values [8, 8], `i` is 10, `a` is 8**
