Output State: **`p` is the previous value of `p` plus the current value of `i`; `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 4.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is updated to the next value, which is the previous value of `i` plus 4, the updated state includes the new value of `i` and the updated list `p`. The condition that `a` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue remains unchanged.
