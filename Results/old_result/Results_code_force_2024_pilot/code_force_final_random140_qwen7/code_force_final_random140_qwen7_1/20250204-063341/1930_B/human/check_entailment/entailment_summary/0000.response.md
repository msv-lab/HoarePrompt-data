Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
- The provided solution generates a permutation by alternating between even and odd numbers from 1 to \( n \). This means the sequence will look like `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, ...]` for even \( n \) and `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, ...]` for odd \( n \), depending on whether \( n \) is even or odd.
- Let's analyze if this approach satisfies the condition:
  - For any pair of indices \( (i, j) \), if \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) are both even or both odd, they cannot divide each other because the difference in their values is at least 1 and they are consecutive in the sequence.
  - If \( p_i \) is even and \( p_j \) is odd (or vice versa), they cannot divide each other because an even number cannot divide an odd number.
- Therefore, the generated permutation meets the requirement that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) exist such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Correctness: **True**
