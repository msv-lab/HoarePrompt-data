Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(2, a + 1, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `a` must be greater than 3
   - `p` is a list containing 4 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop starts from 2 and increments `i` by 2 each time (`range(2, a + 1, 2)`).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `a + 1`.

4. **Calculate the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, the next value of `i` would be 6 if the condition is met.

5. **Check the Condition for `a`**:
   - The condition for `a` is that it must be greater than 3. This condition remains the same for the next iteration.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 6 for the next iteration.
   - `a` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 6, `a` must be greater than 3**
