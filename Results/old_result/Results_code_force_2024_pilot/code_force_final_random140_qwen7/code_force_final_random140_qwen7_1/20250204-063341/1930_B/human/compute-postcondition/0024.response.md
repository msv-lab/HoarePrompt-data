Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `p` is a list containing the integer `i`.
   - `i` is the first integer in the input split + 1.
   - `a` must be at least 2.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from 2 and increments by 2 each time until it reaches or exceeds `a + 1`.
   - The initial value of `i` is the first integer in the input split + 1.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current value in the range.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 (since the increment step is 2).
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` + 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `a + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `i` needs to be updated to its new value.
   - The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.
   - The list `p` contains the integer `i`, so it will be updated to contain the new value of `i`.

6. **New State:**
   - `p` will now contain the new value of `i`.
   - `i` will be the previous value of `i` + 2.
   - `a` must still be at least 2.

Given the above reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`p` is a list containing the integer `i + 2`, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 2, `a` must be at least 2**
