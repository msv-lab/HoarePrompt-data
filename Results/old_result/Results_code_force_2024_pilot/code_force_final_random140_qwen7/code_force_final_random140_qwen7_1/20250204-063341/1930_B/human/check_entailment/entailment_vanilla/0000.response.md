Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which is the length of the required permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The program constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` by:
     - Adding even numbers from 2 to `a` (where `a` is the input `n`).
     - Adding odd numbers from 1 to `a`.

3. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - The problem requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - The constructed permutation alternates between even and odd numbers. This ensures that no two consecutive elements have a divisibility relationship because:
     - Even numbers are not divisible by odd numbers.
     - Odd numbers are not divisible by even numbers.
     - The difference in parity (even vs. odd) prevents any direct divisibility between consecutive elements.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

### Example Verification:
- For `n = 4`:
  - The constructed permutation is `[2, 4, 1, 3]`.
  - Checking pairs:
    - `2` does not divide `4`, `1`, or `3`.
    - `4` does not divide `1` or `3`.
    - `1` does not divide `3`.
  - This permutation satisfies the condition.

- For `n = 3`:
  - The constructed permutation is `[2, 4, 1]` or `[1, 3, 2]` or `[2, 1, 3]` or `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]` or `[3, 1, 2]`.
  - All these permutations satisfy the condition since they alternate between even and odd numbers.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
