Output State: The list `p` contains all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a`, and `i` is the last even number added to the list, which is `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be the last even number less than or equal to `a`. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, it will continue to add even numbers to the list `p` until `i` exceeds `a`. At that point, the loop terminates, and `p` will contain all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a`.
