Output State: The list `p` contains all integers from 1 to `a` in ascending order.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be the next integer after `a` (i.e., `a + 1`), since the inner loops increment `i` by 2 each time starting from 2 and 1 respectively, covering all even and odd numbers up to `a`. The list `p` will contain all integers from 1 to `a` in ascending order because the even numbers are added first followed by the odd numbers.
