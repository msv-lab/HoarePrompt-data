Output State: **`i` is equal to `a + 1`, `p` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `p = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `p`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was previously defined as `a + 1`, where `a` is the first integer input split from the input string. The initial list `p` containing all odd integers from 1 up to (but not including) `a` is no longer valid after the assignment, and `p` is now an empty list.
