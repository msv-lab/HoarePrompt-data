Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = []
    for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The list `p` contains all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a`, and `i` is the last even number added to the list, which is `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be the last even number less than or equal to `a`. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, it will continue to add even numbers to the list `p` until `i` exceeds `a`. At that point, the loop terminates, and `p` will contain all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `a`; `a` must be at least 2; `p` is a list containing all odd integers from 1 up to (but not including) `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `a`, since the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration starting from 1 until it reaches or exceeds `a`. The variable `a` must be at least 2 as per the initial condition. The list `p` will contain all the odd integers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `a`, because the loop adds every odd integer less than `a` to the list `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `a + 1`; `p` is a list containing all the even numbers from 2 up to the largest even number less than or equal to `a` if `a` is even, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is odd.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
