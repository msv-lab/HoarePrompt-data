Output State: **`i` is 1; `a` must be at least 2; `p` is a list containing 1**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `p`. Since `i` is 1, `p` becomes a list containing the element 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for `a` (it must be at least 2) is still valid.
