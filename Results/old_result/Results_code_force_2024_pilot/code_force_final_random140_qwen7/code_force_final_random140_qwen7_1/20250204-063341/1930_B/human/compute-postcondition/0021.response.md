Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `i` is the first integer in the input split + 1**.

The code initializes `p` as an empty list, which means all the even numbers from 2 up to and including the first integer in the input split are no longer stored in `p`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, being the first integer in the input split plus one.
