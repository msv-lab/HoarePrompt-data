Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `p` is a list containing the previous value of `i` plus the current value of `i`.
   - `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2.
   - `a` must still be at least 2.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 2` and increments by 2 until `i` is no longer less than `a + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < a + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the previous value of `i` plus 2.

5. **Determining the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be the previous value of `i` plus 4 (since it was already incremented by 2 in the previous iteration).

6. **Determining the New Condition for the Loop:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `a + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` should be checked against `a + 1`.

7. **Updating the State:**
   - `p` remains unchanged as it contains the previous value of `i` plus the current value of `i`.
   - `i` is updated to the next value, which is the previous value of `i` plus 4.
   - `a` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`p` is a list containing the previous value of `i` plus the current value of `i`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 4, and `a` must still be at least 2.**
