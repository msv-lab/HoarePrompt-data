### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy the condition that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a list `a` with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then rearranges the elements of the list according to the pattern:
     - For even indices (starting from 0), it assigns \( i + 1 \).
     - For odd indices, it assigns \( n - i \).
   - If \( n \) is odd, it sets the last element to \( n // 2 + 1 \).

3. **Checking the Pattern**:
   - Let's verify the pattern for a few values of \( n \):
     - For \( n = 4 \):
       - Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
       - After rearrangement: `[1, 4, 2, 3]`
     - For \( n = 3 \):
       - Initial list: `[1, 2, 3]`
       - After rearrangement: `[1, 3, 2]`

4. **Verification**:
   - For \( n = 4 \) and the permutation `[1, 4, 2, 3]`:
     - Check pairs:
       - \( p_1 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 4 \)
       - \( p_2 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \)
       - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \)
       - \( p_4 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_1 = 1 \)
     - No pair violates the condition.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and the permutation `[1, 3, 2]`:
     - Check pairs:
       - \( p_1 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 3 \)
       - \( p_2 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \)
       - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_1 = 1 \)
     - No pair violates the condition.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given solution generates permutations that satisfy the conditions for the given constraints.
