Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, a + 1, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a + 1` and `i` increments by 2 each time.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` must be a positive integer
   - `p` is a list containing 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Calculate the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `1 + 2 = 3`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `a + 1`. Given that `i` is now 3, `a` must be greater than or equal to 3.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `a`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 3, and `a` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 3, `a` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3**
