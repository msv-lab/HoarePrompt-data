Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `p` is an empty list (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `i` is the first integer in the input split + 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `a + 1` with a step of 2.
   - This means `i` will take on even values starting from 2 up to `a + 1`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must be at least 2 because the smallest value `i` can take is 2.
   - `i` should be set to the first integer in the input split + 1, as given.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`p` is an empty list, `i` is the first integer in the input split + 1, `a` must be at least 2**
