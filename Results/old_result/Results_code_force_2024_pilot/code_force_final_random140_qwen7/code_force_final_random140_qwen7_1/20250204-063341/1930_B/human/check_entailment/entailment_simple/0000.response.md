Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \); \( i \neq j \)) satisfy \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
- The provided solution generates a permutation by alternating between even and odd numbers from 1 to \( n \). This approach ensures that no two consecutive elements in the permutation have one dividing the other, since even and odd numbers do not divide each other directly.
- Let's verify the logic:
  - If \( n \) is even, the permutation will look like: \( [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, \ldots, n, n-1] \).
  - If \( n \) is odd, the permutation will look like: \( [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, \ldots, n-1, n] \).
- This construction guarantees that no two consecutive elements in the permutation have one dividing the other, satisfying the problem's requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution correctly generates a valid permutation for any \( n \) within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
