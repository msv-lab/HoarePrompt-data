Output State: **`i` is 3; `a` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3; `p` is a list containing the value 3.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `p`. Since `i` is 3, `p` becomes a list containing the value 3. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
