Output State: **The list `p` will contain all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a`, and `i` will be the last even number added to the list, which is `a`.**

To elaborate, since the loop increments by 2 starting from 2 up to `a`, it will add all even numbers between 2 and `a` (inclusive) to the list `p`. Given that the loop executed 3 times with the last value of `i` being 10 and `a` being 8, we can infer that `a` is the largest even number included in the final list. Therefore, the list `p` will contain all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a`, which in this case is 8. The variable `i` will hold the last even number added, which is also 8.
