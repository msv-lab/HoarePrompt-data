Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that after the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `a`, `a` must be at least 2, and `p` is a list containing all odd integers from 1 up to (but not including) `a`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of the input value. This means the loop will run `input_value` times.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that each iteration increments `i` by 1.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, which is `a`. Therefore, `i` will become `a + 1`.

5. **Condition Check**: Since the loop runs for `input_value` times, `i` must be less than `input_value` for the loop to continue. Given that `i` is now `a + 1`, `a + 1` must be less than `input_value`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be `a + 1`.
   - `a` remains unchanged and must still be at least 2.
   - The list `p` remains the same because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `p` within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is equal to `a + 1`; `a` must be at least 2; `p` is a list containing all odd integers from 1 up to (but not including) `a`**.
