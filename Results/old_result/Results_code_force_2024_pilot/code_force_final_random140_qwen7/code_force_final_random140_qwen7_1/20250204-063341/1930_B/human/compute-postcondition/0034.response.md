Output State: **`i` is 5; `a` must be greater than 5; `p` is a list containing the value 5.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 5) to the list `p`. Since `i` is 5, `p` becomes a list containing the value 5. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it must still be greater than 5, and the value of `i` remains 5.
