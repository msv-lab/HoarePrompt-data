Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` will be equal to `a + 1`; `p` will be a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` if `a` is an even number, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is odd.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `a + 1` because the loop increments `i` by 2 starting from `a + 1`. The list `p` will contain all the even numbers that were added during each iteration of the loop, which are the even numbers from 2 up to the largest even number less than or equal to `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
    p += [i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1; `a` must be a positive integer; `p` is a list containing 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3; `a` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3; `p` is a list containing the value 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 5; `a` must be a positive integer greater than 5; `p` is a list containing 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
