Output State: **`i` is 1; `a` must be a positive integer; `p` is a list containing 1.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `p`. Since `p` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `p` contains the element 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and the condition that `a` must be a positive integer is still valid.
