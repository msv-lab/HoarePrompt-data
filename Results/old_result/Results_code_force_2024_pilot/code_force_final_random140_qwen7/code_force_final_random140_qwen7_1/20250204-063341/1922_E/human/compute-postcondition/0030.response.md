Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` must be greater than 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a string combining `max` and the original `ans` with a space in between.**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans` concatenates the value of `max` (which is either 99999998 or 99999999) with a space and the original value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
