Output State: `t` is 32, `i` is 3, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '100000000 99999999 99999998 ... -100000000'

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Given the initial value of `x` as 24999999, the loop will execute 32 times (since it takes 32 steps to reduce 24999999 to 1 through the given operations). During each iteration, `max` decreases by 1 when `x` is even, and `min` increases by 1 when `x` is odd. The final value of `x` becomes 1 after 32 iterations. The variable `ans` accumulates the values of `max` and `min` in each step, resulting in a string that lists all the values from 100000000 down to -100000000.
