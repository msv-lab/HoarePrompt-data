Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 2, `x` is either 25000000, 0, 49999999, or -1, `ans` is an empty string, and if `x` is even (`x % 2 == 0`), `max` is 1; otherwise, `min` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `ans`, `max`, and `min`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
