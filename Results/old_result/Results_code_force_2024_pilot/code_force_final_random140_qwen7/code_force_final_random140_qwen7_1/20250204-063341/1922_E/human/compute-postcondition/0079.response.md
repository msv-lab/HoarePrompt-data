Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is either 24999999, 0, 49999998, or -2, `ans` is an empty string, `min` is 1**

Explanation: The code `x -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `x`. Since `x` can be 25000000, 0, 49999999, or -1, after subtracting 1, `x` will be 24999999, -1, 49999998, or -2 respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `ans`, and `min` remain unchanged.
