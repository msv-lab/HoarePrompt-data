Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is either `x // 2` or `x - 1`, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998, -99999997, or -99999999, and `ans` is either a string combining `max` and the original `ans` with a space in between, or a string starting with `min` followed by the original `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Initially, `t` was 2, so now `t` is 3. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
