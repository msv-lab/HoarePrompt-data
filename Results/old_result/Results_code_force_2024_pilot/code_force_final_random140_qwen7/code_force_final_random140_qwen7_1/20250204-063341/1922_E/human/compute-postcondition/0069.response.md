Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is either 49999999 or -1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 -100000000' or '-100000000 100000000'**

Explanation: The variable `x` is decremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `x` can either be 50000000 or 0. If `x` was initially 50000000, it now becomes 49999999. If `x` was initially 0, it now becomes -1. The values of `t`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
