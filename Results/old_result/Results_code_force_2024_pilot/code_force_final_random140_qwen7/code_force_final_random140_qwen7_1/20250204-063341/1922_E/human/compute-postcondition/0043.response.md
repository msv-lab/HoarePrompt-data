Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input from `int(input())`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and the input value.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the input value. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will execute `input_value` times.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `t` is the total number of iterations required to transform `x` into 1.
   - `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999.
   - `min` is -99999998, -99999997, or -99999999.
   - `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min`, starting with the appropriate value based on the parity of `x`, with a space separating each value.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be 1 or 2 (depending on the initial value). The input value remains unchanged.

5. **Final State**: The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1.
   - `x` remains 1.
   - `max` and `min` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is the total number of iterations required to transform `x` into 1, `i` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is -99999998, -99999997, or -99999999, and `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min`, starting with the appropriate value based on the parity of `x`, with a space separating each value.**
