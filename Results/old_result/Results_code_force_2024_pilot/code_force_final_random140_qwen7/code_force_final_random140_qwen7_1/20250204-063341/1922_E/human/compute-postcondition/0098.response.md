Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is 124999999, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '100000000 '**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 using floor division. Given that `x` was originally `24999999`, after the operation, `x` becomes `124999999`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
