Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is either 124999998 or 24999997, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 min -100000000' or '-100000000 min -100000000'**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was either 124999999 or 24999998, after decrementing by 1, `x` becomes either 124999998 or 24999997 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
