Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is ' -100000000 '**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `min` (which is `-100000000`) to the string `ans` with a space in between. Since `ans` was initially an empty string (`''`), after executing the code, `ans` becomes `' -100000000'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
