The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is either 50000000 or 0, both of which are not equal to 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `x`.

However, since the loop condition is `x != 1`, the loop can certainly execute one more time because `x` is not equal to 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is either 50000000 or 0, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 ' or '-100000000'**
