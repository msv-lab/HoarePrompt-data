Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is 24999999, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '-100000000 '**

Explanation: The code updates the `ans` variable by concatenating the string representation of `min` (which is `-100000000`) with a space and the current value of `ans` (which is an empty string). Therefore, `ans` becomes `' -100000000'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
