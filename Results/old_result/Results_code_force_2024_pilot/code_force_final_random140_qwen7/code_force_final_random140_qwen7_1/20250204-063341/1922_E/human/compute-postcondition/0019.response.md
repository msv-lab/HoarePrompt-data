Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `x != 1`.
2. **Determine the current state of `x`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is either `x // 2` (if `x` is even) or `x - 1` (if `x` is odd and not 0).
3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not be equal to 1.

Given the current state:
- `t` is 1
- `i` is 0
- `x` is either `x // 2` (if `x` is even) or `x - 1` (if `x` is odd and not 0)
- `max` is 99999999
- `min` is -99999999
- `ans` is either '100000000 ' (if `x` is even) or '-100000000 ' (if `x` is odd and not 0)

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to continue is `x`. Since the loop continues as long as `x != 1`, `x` must not be equal to 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` must not be equal to 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 ' (if `x` is even) or '-100000000 ' (if `x` is odd and not 0)**
