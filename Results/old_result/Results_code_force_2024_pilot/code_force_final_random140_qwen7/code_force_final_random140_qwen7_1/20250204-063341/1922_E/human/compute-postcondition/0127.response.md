Output State: `t` is 26, `i` is 3, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '100000000 99999999 99999998 99999997 99999996 99999995 ... -100000000 -99999999 -99999998 -99999997 -99999996 -99999995'.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `x` becomes 1. Given the initial value of `x` as 24999999, it takes 26 iterations for `x` to reduce to 1 through the operations defined in the loop (dividing by 2 when even and decrementing by 1 when odd). During these iterations, the `max` and `min` values are adjusted with each iteration, and the `ans` string accumulates the current values of `max` and `min` in reverse order as the loop progresses.
