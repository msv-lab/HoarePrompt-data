Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` must be greater than 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is 'min ans' where `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998 based on the parity of `x` and the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans` concatenates the value of `min` (which is either -99999999 or -99999998) with a space and the current value of `ans` (which is one of the four possible combinations based on the parity of `x` and the value of `i`). Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be the value of `min` followed by a space and the original value of `ans`.
