Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000**.

The code initializes the variable `min` to the value `-100000000`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `x`, or `max`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
