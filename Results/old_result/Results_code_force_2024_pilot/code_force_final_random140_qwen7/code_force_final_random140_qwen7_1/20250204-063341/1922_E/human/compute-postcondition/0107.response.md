Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is either 124999999 or 24999998, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 99999999 ' or '-100000000 100000000 '**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans` concatenates the value of `max` (which is either 99999999 or 100000000) with a space and the current value of `ans`. Depending on the initial value of `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be either '100000000 99999999' or '-100000000 100000000'. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `x`, `max`, and `min`) remain unchanged.
