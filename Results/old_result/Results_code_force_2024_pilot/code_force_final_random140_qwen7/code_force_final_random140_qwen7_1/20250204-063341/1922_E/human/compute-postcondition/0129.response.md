Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 26
- `i` is 3
- `x` is 1
- `max` is 100000000
- `min` is -100000000
- `ans` is a string containing numbers from 100000000 down to -100000000 in reverse order.

The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack the string `ans` and print its contents separated by spaces. Since `ans` contains the numbers from 100000000 down to -100000000 in reverse order, the output will be a sequence of these numbers separated by spaces.

Output: **100000000 99999999 99999998 ... -99999997 -99999996 -99999995 -100000000**
