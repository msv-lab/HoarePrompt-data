Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop condition is `x != 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must not be equal to 1.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `t` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `x` is even or odd (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `x` is an integer input from the user (we need to ensure this is not 1).
   - `max` is 100000000 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `min` is -100000000 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `ans` is an empty string (not relevant to the loop condition).

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop executes the first time, `x` must not be equal to 1. Since `x` is an integer input from the user, we need to make sure that the user inputs a value other than 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` must not be equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string**
