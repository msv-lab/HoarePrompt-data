Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is either 25000000, 0, 49999999, or -1, `ans` is an empty string, `max` is 1**.

Explanation: The initial value of `max` is not explicitly given, but since it is decremented by 1 in the line `max -= 1`, we assume `max` was at least 1 before this operation. After executing `max -= 1`, `max` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
