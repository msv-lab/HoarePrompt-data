Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations required to transform `x` into 1, `i` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is an integer input from the user, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min`, starting with the appropriate value based on the parity of `x`, with a space separating each value.**

Explanation: The code snippet changes the value of `min` from `-99999998`, `-99999997`, or `-99999999` to `-100000000`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `x`, `max`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
