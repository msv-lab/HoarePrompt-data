Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is either 50000000 or 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '99999999 100000000 ' or '100000000 100000000'**

Explanation: The variable `max` is decremented by 1. Depending on its initial value, `max` can now be either 99999998 (if it was initially 99999999) or 99999999 remains unchanged (if it was initially 99999999). All other variables remain unaffected by the code.
