Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is either 50000000 or 0, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '99999999 100000000 ' or '100000000 100000000'**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{max} ' + ans` concatenates the value of `max` (which is either 99999999 or 100000000) with a space and the current value of `ans`. Since `ans` was either '100000000 ' or '-100000000', the new value of `ans` will be either '99999999 100000000 ' or '100000000 100000000'. All other variables remain unchanged.
