Postcondition: `t` is 1, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is either half of its original value if `x` is even, or `x` remains unchanged if `x` is odd and not 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either '99999999 100000000', '99999999 -100000000', '100000000 -99999998', or '-100000000 -99999998' based on the parity of `x`.
