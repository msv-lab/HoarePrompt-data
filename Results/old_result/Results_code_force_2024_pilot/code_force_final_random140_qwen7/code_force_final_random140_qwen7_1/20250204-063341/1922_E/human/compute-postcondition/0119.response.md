Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` is either 31249999 or 62499999, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 99999999 max' or '-100000000 100000000 max' or '100000000 min -100000000 max' or '-100000000 min -100000000 max', `x` is divided by 2.**

The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, meaning it is now half of its original value. The specific values of `x` are either 62499999 or 12499999, so they become 31249999 or 62499999 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
