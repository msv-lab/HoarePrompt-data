Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 3, and `max` remains unchanged, `min` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Since the initial value of `t` was 2, after executing this line, `t` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation.
