Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000**.

The code initializes the variable `max` to the value 100000000. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, or `x`. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
