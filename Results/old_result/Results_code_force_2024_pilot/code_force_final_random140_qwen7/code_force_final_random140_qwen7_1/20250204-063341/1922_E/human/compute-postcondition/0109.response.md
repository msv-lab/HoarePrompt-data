Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is either 62499999 or 12499999, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 99999999 ' or '-100000000 100000000 '**

Explanation: The value of `x` is divided by 2 using integer division (`//`). Since `x` was either 124999999 or 24999998, after the operation, `x` becomes either 62499999 or 12499999. The values of `t`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
