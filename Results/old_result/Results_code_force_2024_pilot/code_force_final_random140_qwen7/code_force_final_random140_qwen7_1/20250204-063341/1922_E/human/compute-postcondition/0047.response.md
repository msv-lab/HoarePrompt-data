Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations required to transform `x` into 1, `i` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is an integer input from the user, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
