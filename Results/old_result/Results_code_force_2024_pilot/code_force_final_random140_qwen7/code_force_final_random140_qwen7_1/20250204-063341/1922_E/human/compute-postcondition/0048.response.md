Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is an integer input from the user, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code `t = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
