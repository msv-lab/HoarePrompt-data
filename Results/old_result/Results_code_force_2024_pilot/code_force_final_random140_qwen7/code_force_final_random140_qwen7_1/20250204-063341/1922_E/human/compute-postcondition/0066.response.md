Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is either 25000000 or 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '99999999 100000000 ' or '100000000 100000000'**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` can be either 50000000 or 0, after the operation, `x` becomes 25000000 or 0 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
