Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is 24999999, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is either 124999999 or 24999998, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 ' or '-100000000 '
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `i` is 3, if `x` is even, `x` is updated to either 62499999 or 12499999, `max` is updated to either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is updated to either -100000000 or -99999999, and `ans` is updated to either '100000000 99999999' or '-100000000 100000000'. If `x` is odd, `x` is updated to either 124999998 or 24999997, `max` remains 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is updated to -99999999, and `ans` is updated to either '100000000 min -100000000' or '-100000000 min -100000000'.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `i` is 3, and `max` remains unchanged, `min` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
