Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is either 25000000, 0, 49999999, or -1, `ans` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code `ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans` is trying to concatenate the string representation of the variable `max` with a space and the current value of `ans`. However, the variable `max` is not defined in the given initial state, and there is no assignment to `max` before this line. Therefore, the concatenation operation will result in `ans` being an empty string since there is nothing to concatenate to it. The values of `t`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
