Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` is either `x // 2` (if `x` is even) or `x - 1` (if `x` is odd and not 0), `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 ' (if `x` is even) or '-100000000 ' (if `x` is odd and not 0)**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
