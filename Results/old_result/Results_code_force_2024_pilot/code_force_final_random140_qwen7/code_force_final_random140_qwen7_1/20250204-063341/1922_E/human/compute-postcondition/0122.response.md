Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` is either 62499998 or 12499998, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 or remains 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is -99999998 or -99999999, `ans` is 'min ' + `ans'**

Explanation: The variable `x` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `x` could be either 62499999 or 12499999. After decrementing by 1, `x` will be 62499998 or 12499998 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
