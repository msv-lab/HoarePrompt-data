Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` is either half of its original value or remains unchanged, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, and `ans` is either '99999999 100000000', '99999999 -100000000', '100000000 -99999998', or '-100000000 -99999998' based on the parity of `x` and the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The line `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially 1, it now becomes 2. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them in the given code snippet.
