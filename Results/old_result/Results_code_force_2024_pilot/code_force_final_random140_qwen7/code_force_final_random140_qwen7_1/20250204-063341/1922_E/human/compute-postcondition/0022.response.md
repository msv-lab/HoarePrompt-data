Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` is half of its original value, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, or '99999999 -100000000 ' if `x` is odd and not 0.**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides `x` by 2 using integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number. The values of `t`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is updated to half of its original value. The condition for `ans` remains the same based on whether `x` is even or odd (excluding 0).
