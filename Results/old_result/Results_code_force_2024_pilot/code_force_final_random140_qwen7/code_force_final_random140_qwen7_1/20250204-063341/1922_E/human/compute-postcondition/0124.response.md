Postcondition: `t` is 2, `i` is 3. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, and `max` is updated accordingly. If `x` is odd, `x` is either 62499998 or 12499998, `max` remains unchanged, and `min` is updated. The `ans` variable is modified as follows: if `x` is even, `ans` becomes either '100000000 99999999 max', '-100000000 100000000 max', '100000000 min -100000000 max', or '-100000000 min -100000000 max'. If `x` is odd, `ans` becomes 'min ' + `ans`.
