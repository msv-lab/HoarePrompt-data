Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, `X` is an integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\). The function returns a result based on the values of `t` and `X` for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value for `t` and `X`, and returns a result for each based on the given ranges for `t` and `X`.
