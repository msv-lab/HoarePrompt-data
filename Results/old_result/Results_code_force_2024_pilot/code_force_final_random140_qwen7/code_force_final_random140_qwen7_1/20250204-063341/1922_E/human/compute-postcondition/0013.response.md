Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is the string '-100000000 ', and `x` is an odd number.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `min` (which is '-100000000') with a space and the current value of `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, the new value of `ans` is '-100000000 '. All other variables remain unchanged.
