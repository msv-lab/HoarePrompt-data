Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer - 1 and not equal to 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is the string '-100000000 '**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, making it an integer that is one less than its original value and ensuring it is not equal to 0 (since it was not equal to 1 before). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
