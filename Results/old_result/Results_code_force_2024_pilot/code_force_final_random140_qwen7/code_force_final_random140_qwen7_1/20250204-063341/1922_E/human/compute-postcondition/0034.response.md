Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `x` must be greater than 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999997, `ans` is 'min ans' where `min` is either -99999998 or -99999997 based on the parity of `x` and the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `min` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `min` could be either -99999999 or -99999998. Incrementing either of these values results in -99999998 becoming -99999997 and -99999999 remaining unchanged since adding 1 to -99999999 would overflow and wrap around to the maximum 32-bit signed integer value, which is 2147483647, but in this context, it simply wraps to -99999998 due to the constraints given. Therefore, `min` is now either -99999998 or -99999997, and `ans` remains 'min ans' reflecting the updated value of `min`.
