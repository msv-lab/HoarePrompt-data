Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is either '100000000 -99999998' (if `x` is even) or '-100000000 -99999998' (if `x` is odd and not 0'**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Initially, `x` was either '100000000 -99999998' if it was even, or '-100000000 -99999998' if it was odd and not 0. After decrementing `x` by 1, it now falls into the category of being either even or odd and not 0, depending on its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
