Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is either '100000000 -99999999' (if `x` is even) or '-100000000 -99999999' (if `x` is odd and not 0)**

Explanation: The code concatenates the string representation of `min` with a space and the current value of `ans`. Since `min` is `-99999999`, the new value of `ans` is either `'100000000 -99999999'` if `x` is even, or `'-100000000 -99999999'` if `x` is odd and not 0. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `max`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
