Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `x` is 24999999
   - `max` is 100000000
   - `min` is -100000000
   - `ans` is an empty string

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `x != 1`.
   - Currently, `x` is 24999999, which is not equal to 1.

Since the current value of `x` already satisfies the condition `x != 1`, no adjustments are necessary for `x`.

4. **Check Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` do not affect the loop condition `x != 1`.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is 24999999, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string**
