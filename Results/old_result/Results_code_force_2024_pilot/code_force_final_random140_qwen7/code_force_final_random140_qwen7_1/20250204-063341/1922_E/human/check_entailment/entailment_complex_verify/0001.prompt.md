You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #State: `t` is 1000, `i` is 1000, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a string containing the sequence of alternating `max` and `min` values from 100000000 down to -100000000 and back up to 100000000 in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and an implied integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). It then performs a series of operations on `X`, tracking the number of steps (`t`) taken until `X` becomes 1. During these operations, it alternates between decrementing `X` by 1 when `X` is odd and halving `X` when `X` is even, recording a sequence of maximum and minimum values (`max` and `min`) in reverse order. Finally, it prints the count of steps (`t`) and the recorded sequence of values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution provided attempts to construct such an array using a binary-like approach.

2. **Key Points of the Solution**:
   - The solution initializes `max` and `min` to represent the maximum and minimum values that can be used in the array.
   - It uses a loop to reduce `x` (the target number of increasing subsequences) to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 when even, or decrementing it by 1 when odd.
   - For each division or decrement, it appends either the `max` value or the `min` value to the answer string `ans`.

3. **Analysis of the Logic**:
   - The logic aims to create a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`. However, the implementation does not correctly account for the number of increasing subsequences generated.
   - The approach of alternating between `max` and `min` values does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences. This method will not produce the desired result for all values of `X`.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider `X = 5`. The correct array could be `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0]. 
   - However, the provided solution would generate a sequence like `[100000000, -100000000, 100000000]` for `X = 5`, which does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`.
