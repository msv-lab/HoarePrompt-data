Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading/trailing whitespace, `ls` is a list of strings with the last element removed, `last` is the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls` - the list `ls` is sorted and the second largest element is taken as `other`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `other` to be the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`. Since `ls` is a list of strings, it is first sorted (which sorts them lexicographically), and then the second largest element is taken. The other variables remain unchanged.
