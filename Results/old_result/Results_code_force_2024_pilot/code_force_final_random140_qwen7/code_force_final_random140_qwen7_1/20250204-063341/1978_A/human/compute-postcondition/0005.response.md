Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `ls` and removes the largest element using `pop()`, leaving `other` as the second largest element in the list. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `n`, `ls`, and `last` remain unchanged.
