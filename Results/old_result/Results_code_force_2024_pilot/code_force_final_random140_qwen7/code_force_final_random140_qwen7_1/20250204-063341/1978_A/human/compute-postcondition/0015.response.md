Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading/trailing whitespace, `ls` is a list of strings, `last` is the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`**

Explanation: The code `ls = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to `ls`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `last`, `other`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 2 is still valid. The value of `n` remains as the integer input stripped of leading/trailing whitespace. The value of `last` is now the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer, and `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`.
