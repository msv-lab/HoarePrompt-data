Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings, `last` is the last element of `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`, `ls` is updated to a list of strings from input, `n` is an input integer, `last` is now the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `last = int(ls.pop())` pops the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `last`. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `last` is now the last element of the updated list `ls` converted to an integer.
