Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and the last element of `ls` is converted to an integer and assigned to `last`.**

Explanation: The code `last = int(ls.pop())` pops the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, assigning the result to `last`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 remains unchanged. The value of `n` and the list `ls` are modified as described.
