Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and now `t` is set to the integer value of the input provided by the user.**

The code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property but is now specifically set to the integer value entered by the user.
