Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading/trailing whitespace, `ls` is a list of strings with the last element removed, `last` is the last element of the updated `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the sorted list `ls`**.

Explanation: The code `last = int(ls.pop())` removes the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `last`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `ls`, and `other`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
