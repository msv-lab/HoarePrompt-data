Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the program checks only certain conditions for odd indices and prints 'NO' immediately if those conditions are met. However, this approach is incomplete and does not cover all necessary scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
4
<>><
<<>>
```

In this case, the robot can move as follows:
1. Start at (1, 1) and move right to (1, 2).
2. Move according to the arrow in (1, 2) to (2, 2).
3. Move right to (2, 3).
4. Move according to the arrow in (2, 3) to (1, 3).
5. Move right to (1, 4).
6. Move according to the arrow in (1, 4) to (2, 4).

This path shows that the robot can indeed reach (2, 4), but the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' because it only checks a few specific conditions without considering the full traversal logic.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
