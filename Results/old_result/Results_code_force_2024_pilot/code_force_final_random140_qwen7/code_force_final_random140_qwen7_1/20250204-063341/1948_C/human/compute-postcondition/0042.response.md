Output State: **The loop will either print 'NO' and terminate early if any condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is met for any `i` in the range, or it will print 'YES' if no such conditions are met for all valid `i` values.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will print 'YES' if none of the specified conditions are found for any `i` in the range (1 to `n-1` with a step of 2). If any of these conditions are met at any point during the loop's execution, the loop will break and print 'NO', thus terminating the loop early.
