Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without encountering any condition that breaks it out. Therefore, the final output is 'YES'.

Explanation: The loop iterates over every second index starting from 1 up to `n-1`. For each iteration, it checks two conditions:
1. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == '<' == b[i + 1]` or `a[i] == '<' == b[i - 1]`.
2. If either of these conditions is true, the loop breaks and outputs 'NO'.
3. If none of the conditions are met throughout all iterations, the loop completes without breaking, and the final output is 'YES'.
