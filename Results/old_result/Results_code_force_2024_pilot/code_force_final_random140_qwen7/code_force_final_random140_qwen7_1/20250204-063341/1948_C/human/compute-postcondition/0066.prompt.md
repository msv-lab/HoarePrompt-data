Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the input consists of t test cases, each test case includes a line with a single integer n, followed by two lines containing strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('NO')
            break
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without encountering any condition that breaks it out. Therefore, the final output is 'YES'.

In Natural Language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is 'YES', indicating that none of the conditions within the loop that would cause it to print 'NO' and break were met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop will either print 'NO' and terminate early if any condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is met for any `i` in the range, or it will print 'YES' if no such conditions are met for all valid `i` values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i + 1 < n` and the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` do not hold true for any iteration. After all iterations, if the loop completes without breaking (i.e., no `print('NO')` was executed), the final value of `i` will be `n-2` because the loop increments `i` by 2 each time and stops when `i` reaches `n-1`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: `i` is `n-2`, and the loop does not print 'NO'. The final output printed will be 'YES' if the loop completes without breaking.

This means the final output state is: `i` is `n-2`, and the final output is 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
