Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `i + 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement mentioned in the precondition. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify them.
