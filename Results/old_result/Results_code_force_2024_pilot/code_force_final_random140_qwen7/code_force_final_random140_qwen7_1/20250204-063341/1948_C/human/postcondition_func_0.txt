The function processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer \( n \) (even and between 2 and \( 2 \times 10^5 \)) and two strings of length \( n \) consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. For each test case, it checks if there exists an odd index \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \) where the character at index \( i \) in the first string matches either the character at index \( i+1 \) or \( i-1 \) in the second string and both are '<'. If such a condition is found, it prints 'NO' and stops processing further. If no such condition is found after checking all possible indices, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the above logic.
