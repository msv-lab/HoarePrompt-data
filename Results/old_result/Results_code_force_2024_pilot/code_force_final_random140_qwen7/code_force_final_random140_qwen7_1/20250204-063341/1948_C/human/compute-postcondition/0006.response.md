Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be at least 3.
- The current value of `i` plus one is less than `n`.
- Either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is less than '<' or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is less than '<'.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO' regardless of the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `i`.

Output: **NO**
