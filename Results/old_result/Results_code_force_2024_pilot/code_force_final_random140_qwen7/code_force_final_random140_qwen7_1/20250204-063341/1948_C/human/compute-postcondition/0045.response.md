Output State: **`j` is `j_prev + 1`; `a` is an input string, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the input received from the user, which is a string. The value of `j` is updated to `j_prev + 1` as stated in the initial state. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was already defined as an input integer.
