Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is defined as `i + 2`.
- There is a condition where either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is less than a character, or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is less than a character. In either case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

However, the `print('NO')` statement does not depend on the conditions mentioned above. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
