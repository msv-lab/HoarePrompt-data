Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in steps of 2 starting from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` must be an odd number.

3. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is an index such that `i + 1` is less than `n`.
   - Either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is less than '<' or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is less than '<'.
   - In either case, the loop or condition we were inside is exited.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` should be `i + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 2` must still satisfy the condition `i + 1 < n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so if `i` was previously `i`, the new value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - The condition `i + 1 < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is now `i + 2`.
- The condition `i + 1 < n` must still hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is an index such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, where `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2.**
