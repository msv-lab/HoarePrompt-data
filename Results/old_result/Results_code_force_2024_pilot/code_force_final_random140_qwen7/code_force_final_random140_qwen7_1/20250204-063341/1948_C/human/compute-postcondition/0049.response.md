Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
- The second element of `a` is either equal to the first element of `b` and both are less than, or the first element of `a` is equal to the second element of `b` and both are less than. However, these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print('NO')` statement.
- The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the output is simply the string 'NO'.
