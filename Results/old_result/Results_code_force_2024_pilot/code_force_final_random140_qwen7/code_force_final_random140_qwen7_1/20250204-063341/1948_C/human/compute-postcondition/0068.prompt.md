You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the input consists of t test cases, each test case includes a line with a single integer n, followed by two lines containing strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without encountering any condition that breaks it out. Therefore, the final output is 'YES'.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the output state is 'YES', indicating that none of the conditions within the loop that would cause it to print 'NO' and break were met. The loop processes each odd index `i` from 1 to `n-2` (since `i` increments by 2 each time), checking the specified conditions. If none of these conditions are satisfied for any `i`, the loop prints 'YES' after completing all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes t test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), followed by two lines of strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. It does not return any value directly but processes the input according to the specified rules for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
