Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `n` with a step of 2. This means `i` will take odd values.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i + 1 < n`.
   - With `i` being 5, the condition becomes `5 + 1 < n` or `6 < n`.

Given these points, let's update the state for the next iteration of the loop:

- `i` will be 5.
- `n` must still be greater than 3, but now it must also be greater than 6 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 6**
