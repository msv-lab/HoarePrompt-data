Postcondition: `i` is an index such that `i + 3` is less than `n`, and if either `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == '<' == b[i + 1]` or `a[i] == '<' == b[i - 1]` is true, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If neither condition is met, no action is taken regarding the loop or if statement.
