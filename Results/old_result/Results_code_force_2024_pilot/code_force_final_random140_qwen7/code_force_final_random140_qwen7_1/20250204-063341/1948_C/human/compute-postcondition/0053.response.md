Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 each time until it reaches a value where `i + 1` is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of characters.
   - `b` is a list of characters.
   - The loop breaks if `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` holds true.

4. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next possible value for `i` would be 3 (because the loop increments by 2).
   - For `i` to be 3, `i + 1` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `2 < n` must hold true.
   - We don't need to check the conditions involving `a` and `b` because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not change within the loop head.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `2 < n` must hold true).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
