Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The logic in the loop checks only certain conditions and breaks early if those conditions are met, but it does not fully account for all possible paths the robot can take. Here's why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Conditions**: The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is too restrictive. It only checks if the robot can move down and then left or if it can move left and then down at specific positions. This does not cover all possible scenarios where the robot might need to navigate through the grid.

2. **Missing Path Traversal**: The solution does not simulate the full traversal of the grid to check if the robot can reach (2, n). Instead, it makes an early exit based on a few conditions, which is insufficient.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, you should simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_reach_target():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Simulate the robot's path
        x, y = 1, 1  # Start at (1, 1)
        while True:
            if x == 2 and y == n:
                print('YES')
                break
            elif x == 1:
                if a[y-1] == '>':
                    y += 1
                else:
                    x, y = 2, y
            else:  # x == 2
                if b[y-1] == '<':
                    y -= 1
                else:
                    x, y = 1, y
        
        else:
            print('NO')

can_reach_target()
```

This solution simulates the robot's movement step-by-step, checking if it can reach the target cell (2, n) by following the arrows in the grid.
