Output State: **`j` is `j_prev + 1`; `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `b = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `b`. The variables `j`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is still `j_prev + 1`, `a` remains an input string, and `b` becomes the new input string from the user.
