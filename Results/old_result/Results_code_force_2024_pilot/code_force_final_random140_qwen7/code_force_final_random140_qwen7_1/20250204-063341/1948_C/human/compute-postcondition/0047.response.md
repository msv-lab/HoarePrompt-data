Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n, 2)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`, starting from `1` and incrementing by `2` each time.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being `1`, we know that `i` must be `1` at the start of the loop.

4. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `1` because the loop starts at `1` and increments by `2` each time. If `n` were `1` or less, the loop would not execute.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `j`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
