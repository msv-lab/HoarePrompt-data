Postcondition: `i` is an index such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, where `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2. If `i + 1 < n` and both `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are equal to '<', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the above condition is not met and `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are equal to '<', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
