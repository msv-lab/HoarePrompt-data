The function processes a string `s` and an integer `n`. It iterates through possible substrings of `s` to find pairs of characters that match or are replaced by '?'. If it finds a valid pair of length `j`, it prints `2 * j` and returns immediately. If no such pair is found after checking all possible lengths, it returns 0.
