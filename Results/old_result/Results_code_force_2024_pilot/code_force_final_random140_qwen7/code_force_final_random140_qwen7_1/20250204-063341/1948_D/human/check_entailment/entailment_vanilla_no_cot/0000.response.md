Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not used correctly**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly within the loop that processes each test case. The function should be called to perform the necessary checks and calculations for each test case.

2. **Logic for checking tandem repeats is flawed**: The current logic in `func_1` does not correctly check for tandem repeats. It increments a `count` variable without considering the actual tandem repeat condition. Instead, it should check if the characters at positions `k` and `k+j` match or if either character is a `?`.

3. **Return statement placement**: The return statement inside the nested loops will exit the function prematurely when the first tandem repeat is found, which may not always yield the maximum possible length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    
    def func_1():
        nonlocal max_length
        for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
            count = 0
            for k in range(0, n - j):
                if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count = 0
                if count == j:
                    max_length = max(max_length, j * 2)
                    break
            if max_length > 0:
                break
    
    func_1()
    print(max_length)
```

In this corrected version:
- The function `func_1` is called after defining it.
- The `max_length` variable is updated whenever a longer tandem repeat is found.
- The function exits the loop early if a longer tandem repeat is found, ensuring the maximum length is considered.
