Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `j` is defined as `n // 2`, meaning `j` is the integer division of `n` by 2.
- `count` is equal to `j`, so `count` is also `n // 2`.
- There is a string `s` where certain conditions are checked for indices `k` and `k + j`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

Given that `count` is equal to `j` and `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is `n // 2`. Therefore, `count * 2` would be `n`.

Output: **n**
