Postcondition: **`j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, and `count` is incremented by 1 if `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` in the if condition. If the condition `count == j` is true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the condition is false, `count` remains unchanged.**
