Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n // 2 - 1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is a string
- `count` is equal to `j`

The expression `count * 2` will be evaluated and printed.

Given that `count` is equal to `j`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, the value of `count` is `n // 2 - 1`.

Therefore, the expression `count * 2` will evaluate to `2 * (n // 2 - 1)`.

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2 \times (n // 2 - 1) = n - 2 \]

So, the print statement will output `n - 2`.

Output: **n - 2**
