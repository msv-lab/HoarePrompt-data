Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of all strings s over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will continue to execute until `count` equals `j` or the range condition `0 <= k < n - j` is no longer satisfied. If `count` equals `j` at any point during the loop's execution, the loop will print `count * 2` and then terminate. If the loop completes all iterations without `count` ever reaching `j`, it will exit without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, and `count` is incremented by 1 each time the condition `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` is met. The loop continues until `count` equals `j`, at which point it prints `count * 2` and returns. If the loop does not find a sequence where `count` equals `j` within the range of the loop, it will exit without printing anything.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `j` remains `n // 2 - 1`, `n` and `s` stay the same, and `count` will be the length of the longest sequence where each character matches its counterpart `j` positions ahead, or is a question mark (`'?'`). If such a sequence exists, the loop will print `2 * count` and then stop. If no such sequence exists, the loop will simply end without any print statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `count` is 2, `k` is `n // 2`.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, we can deduce the following:

- The loop runs from `k = 0` to `k = n - j - 1`.
- After the first iteration (`k = 0`), `count` is either 0 or 1, but it does not reach `j` (which is `n // 2 - 2`).
- After the second iteration (`k = 1`), `count` is set to 1 and the loop exits because the condition `count == j` is checked and met, leading to the print statement and return.
- For the third iteration (`k = 2`), `count` is either incremented to 2 if the condition is met again, or reset to 0 if not. However, since the loop exits when `count == j`, `count` will be 2 after the third iteration.

Thus, after all iterations, `count` will be 2, and `k` will be `n // 2` (since the loop increments `k` each time and stops at `n - j - 1`). The other variables (`j`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
