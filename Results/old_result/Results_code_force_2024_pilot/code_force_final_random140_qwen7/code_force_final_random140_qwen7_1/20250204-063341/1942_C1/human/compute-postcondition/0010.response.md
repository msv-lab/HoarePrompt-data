Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `x`, and the range function parameters.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `x` is an integer from the input split.
   - The range function `range(1, x + 1)` means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `x` must be at least 1.
   - Other variables like `n`, `arr`, `ans`, and `t` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` must be at least 1**
