Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - `x` is the same as before.
   - `ans` is either `ans + 1` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`, or remains the same as before if the condition is not met.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`. Therefore, `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `x + 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is `i_end + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 2`.
   - The value of `x` remains the same.
   - The value of `ans` depends on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to change `ans` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `arr` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `i_end + 2`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains the same as before.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `x` is the same as before, and `ans` is the same as before.**
