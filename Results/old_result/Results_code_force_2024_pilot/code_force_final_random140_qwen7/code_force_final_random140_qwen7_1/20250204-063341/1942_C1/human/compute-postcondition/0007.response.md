Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer from the input split, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split; `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained by converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the original list of strings remain unchanged. After sorting, `arr` contains the first `x` elements of the original list of strings converted to integers, arranged in ascending order.
