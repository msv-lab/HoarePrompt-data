Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - `x` is the same as before.
   - `ans` is either `ans + 1` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`, or remains the same as before if the condition is not met.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`. This means `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `x + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 2`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`. Since we don't know the exact value of `ans` at the end of the previous iteration, we will leave it as it is unless we have more information about the condition.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i_end + 2`.
- `x` is the same as before.
- `ans` remains the same as before unless the condition is met.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `x` is the same as before, and `ans` is either `ans + 1` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`, or remains the same as before if the condition is not met.**
