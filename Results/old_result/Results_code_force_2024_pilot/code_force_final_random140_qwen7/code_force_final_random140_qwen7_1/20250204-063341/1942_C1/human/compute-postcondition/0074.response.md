Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `x + 1`, `x` will remain the same as it was initially, and `ans` will be the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was true during the loop's execution.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one more than `x`, `x` will stay the same as it was at the start, and `ans` will reflect the initial count of `x - 2` plus any additional increments due to the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` being exactly 2 throughout the loop's execution.
