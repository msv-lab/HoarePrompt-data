Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings obtained from input(), `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `[n, x, y]` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This affects the `arr` variable, converting it from a sorted list of integers (with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended) to a list of strings. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
