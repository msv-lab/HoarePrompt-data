Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` is the same as before, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`. If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is not met during any iteration, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `x + 1`, `x` will remain the same as it was initially, and `ans` will be the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was true during the loop's execution.
