Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `int(arr[i]) - int(arr[i - 1])` equals 2, and `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `arr`, which is calculated as `n + arr[0]`. This new element is added while maintaining the sorted order of the list. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
