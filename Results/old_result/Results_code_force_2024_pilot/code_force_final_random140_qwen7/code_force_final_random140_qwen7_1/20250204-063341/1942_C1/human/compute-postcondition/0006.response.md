Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer from the input split, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings.**

Explanation: The code converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr`, which originally contains strings, into integers and assigns them to a new list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
