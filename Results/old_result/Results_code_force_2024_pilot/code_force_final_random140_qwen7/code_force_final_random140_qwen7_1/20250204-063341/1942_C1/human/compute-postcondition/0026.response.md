Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `x` must be at least 1, `i` will be equal to `x + 1`, `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is decremented by 1, while the other variables (`x`, `i`, `ans`, and the condition on `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
