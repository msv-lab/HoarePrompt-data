Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `x + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < x + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is `x`; otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 1`.
   - `t` is still greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x + 1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be `i + 1` and `x + 1` should remain the same.

5. **Check the postconditions**:
   - The value of `ans` depends on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`. This condition will be checked in the next iteration.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `arr` remains a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended.
- `i` is `i + 2` (since it was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration).
- `ans` remains `x` or `x - 1` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is `i + 2`, `ans` remains `x` or `x - 1` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`, and `t` is still greater than 0.**
