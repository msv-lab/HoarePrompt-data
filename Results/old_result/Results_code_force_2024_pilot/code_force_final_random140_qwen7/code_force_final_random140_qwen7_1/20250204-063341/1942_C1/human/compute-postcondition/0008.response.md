Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer from the input split, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split; `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `n + arr[0]` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially a sorted list of integers obtained by converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings, appending `n + arr[0]` updates the list. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The updated list `arr` now includes the new element `n + arr[0]` at its end.
