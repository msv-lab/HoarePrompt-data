The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` must be at least 1, `i` will be equal to `x + 1`, and `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2. However, none of these states directly affect the loop condition `t > 0`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t` itself. Since the loop can certainly execute one more time as long as `t` is greater than 0, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`x` must be at least 1, `i` will be equal to `x + 1`, `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2, and `t` must be greater than 0**
