Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from the given `x` vertices.

2. **Current Approach**: The current code calculates the number of triangles formed by consecutive vertices in the sorted list `arr`. This approach does not account for the fact that we can add up to `y` additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

3. **Correct Approach**: To maximize the number of triangles, we should aim to create as many triangles as possible using the given vertices and any additional vertices we can add. Since `y = 0` in this version, we only need to consider the given `x` vertices.

4. **Calculation**: For a polygon with `n` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `n - 2`. However, since we are only given `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles we can form is `x - 2`.

Given these points, the correct solution should directly compute `x - 2` without any additional logic for adding vertices, as `y = 0`.

### Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            # Since y = 0, we do not need to add any additional vertices.
            ans = x - 2
            print(ans)
```

This solution directly computes the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the given `x` vertices, which is `x - 2`.
