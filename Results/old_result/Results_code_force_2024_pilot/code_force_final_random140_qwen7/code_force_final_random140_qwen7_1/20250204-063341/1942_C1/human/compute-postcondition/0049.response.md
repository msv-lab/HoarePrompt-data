The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is still greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x + 1`, and `t` must be greater than 0**
