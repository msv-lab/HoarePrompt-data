Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `[n, x, y]` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input and assigns them to the list `[n, x, y]`. This changes the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, but does not affect the values of `arr`, `i`, `ans`, and `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
