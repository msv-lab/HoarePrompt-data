Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    arr.sort()
    arr.append(n + arr[0])
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be at least 1, `i` will be equal to `x + 1`, and `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with the new element `n + arr[0]` appended, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x + 1`, and `t` is still greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` is the same as before, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2`. If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is not met during any iteration, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `x + 1`, `x` will remain the same as it was initially, and `ans` will be the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was true during the loop's execution.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
