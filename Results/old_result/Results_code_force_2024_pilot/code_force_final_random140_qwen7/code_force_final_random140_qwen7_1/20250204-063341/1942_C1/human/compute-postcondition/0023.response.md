Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be at least 1, `i` will be equal to `x + 1`, and `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will still be the same as the initial value provided (since it's not modified within the loop), `i` will be `x + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `x` inclusive, and `ans` will have been incremented by 1 every time the difference between consecutive elements in the array `arr` is exactly 2.
