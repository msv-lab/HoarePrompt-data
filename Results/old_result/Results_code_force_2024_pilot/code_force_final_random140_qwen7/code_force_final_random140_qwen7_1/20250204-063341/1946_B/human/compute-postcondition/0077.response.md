Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less than before); `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`; `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value 0. The list `l` and the variable `maxi` retain their previous states, with `l` having at least one element (one less than before) and `maxi` being the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
