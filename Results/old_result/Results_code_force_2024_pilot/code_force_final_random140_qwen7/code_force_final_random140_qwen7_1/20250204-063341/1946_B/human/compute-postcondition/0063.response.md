Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the input integer, and `i` is `k + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables (`maxi`, `l`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `maxi` is still determined by the maximum value between the final value of `c` (which is now 0) and the initial value of `maxi`. The list `l` and the values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are unaffected by the assignment to `c`.
