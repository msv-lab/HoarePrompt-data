Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`, `maxi` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` (which is 0) and `maxi` (which is also 0). Since both values are the same, `maxi` remains 0. All other variables (`c`, `l`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.
