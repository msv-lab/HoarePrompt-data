Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the input integer, and `i` is `k + n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least one element. If there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of each element `ele` in `l` that is greater than or equal to 0 or where `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less than before). If `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is the sum of the elements in `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less than before), `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is the cumulative sum of all elements processed so far, including the current element, and `maxi` is updated based on the condition `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`. If `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `c` is 0 and `maxi` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele` and `maxi` is updated accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
