Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the input integer, and `i` is `k + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts each element into an integer, storing them in the list `l`. The values of `maxi`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `l` is updated to contain the integers entered by the user.
