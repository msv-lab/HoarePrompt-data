Postcondition: **`c` is either 0 or the next element from the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`. If `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `c` is updated to `abs(ele)`. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.**
