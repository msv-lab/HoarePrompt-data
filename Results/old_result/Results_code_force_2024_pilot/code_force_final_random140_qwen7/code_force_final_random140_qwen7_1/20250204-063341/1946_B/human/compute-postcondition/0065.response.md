Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in l:`. The objects involved here are `ele`, `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `ele` is the variable that will take each element from the list `l` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element. This ensures that there is something for `ele` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, we cannot directly change its content without knowing the user's input. However, we can ensure that `l` contains at least one element.
   - The variable `ele` will be set to each element of `l` during the loop iterations, but its initial value is not relevant to the loop's execution condition.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is the state of the list `l` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
