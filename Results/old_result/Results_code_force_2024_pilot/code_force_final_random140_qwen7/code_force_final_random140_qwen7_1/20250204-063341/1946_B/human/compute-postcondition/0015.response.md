Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ele` is the first element of `l`.
   - `l` must have at least one element.
   - If `ele` is less than 0, `c` is 0 and is less than or equal to the maximum of `maxi` and `c`.
   - If `ele` is greater than or equal to 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for ele in l:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `ele` is being iterated over each element of the list `l`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must still have at least one element.

4. **Updating States:**
   - Since `ele` is the first element of `l` at the start of the current iteration, it will be the second element for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `ele` will now be the second element of `l`.
   - `l` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

5. **Condition for Updating `c`:**
   - The condition for updating `c` depends on the value of `ele` and its relationship with `c` and `maxi`.
   - We need to consider both cases:
     - If `ele` is less than 0, `c` remains 0.
     - If `ele` is greater than or equal to 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `ele` will be the second element of `l`.
- `l` must still have at least one element.
- The value of `c` remains as per the condition from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ele` is the second element of `l`, `l` must have at least one element, `c` remains as per the previous iteration's condition.**
