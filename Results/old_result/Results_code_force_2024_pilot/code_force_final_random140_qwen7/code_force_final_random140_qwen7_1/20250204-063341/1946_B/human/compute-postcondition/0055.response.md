Output State: **`c` is either 0 or the next element from the list `l`, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`, `c` is increased by `ele`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. Since `ele` is not defined in the context provided, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know it is added to `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
