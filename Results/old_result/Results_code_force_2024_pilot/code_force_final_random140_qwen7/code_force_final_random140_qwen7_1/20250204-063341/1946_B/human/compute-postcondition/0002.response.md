Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
