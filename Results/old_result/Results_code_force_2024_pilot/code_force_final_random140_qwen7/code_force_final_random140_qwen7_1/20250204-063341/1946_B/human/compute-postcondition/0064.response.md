Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the input integer, and `i` is `k + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `maxi`. This updates the value of `maxi` from its previous state (which was the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
