Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a non-negative integer value.
   - Since `t` is defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input will always provide a valid integer within this range.

3. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We know that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - The loop will run `t` times based on the input provided.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration.
   - The input value (which we denote as `t`) must be a positive integer and within the specified range.

Given these points, the initial state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute properly is:

- `i` should start from 0.
- The input value should be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.
