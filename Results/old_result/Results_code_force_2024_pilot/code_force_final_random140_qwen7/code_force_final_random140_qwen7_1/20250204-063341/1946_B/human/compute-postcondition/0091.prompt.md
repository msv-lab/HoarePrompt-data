Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. The array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `c` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `l` that are greater than or equal to 0, or the maximum of `c` and the absolute value of negative elements in `l` if `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of those elements. The variable `maxi` will store the highest value that `c` attains during the iterations where `c` is reset to 0 due to encountering a negative element in `l` that satisfies the condition `c <= abs(ele)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxi` is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`, `l` will be the list of integers as provided, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, and `i` is `k + n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `maxi` is updated to the maximum value of `c` that satisfies the condition `ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele)` during any iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
