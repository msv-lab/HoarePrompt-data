Output State: **`ele` is the third element of `l`, `l` must have at least one element, and `c` is increased by the third element of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`, which is the third element of the list `l`. The conditions and the fact that `l` must have at least one element remain unchanged.
