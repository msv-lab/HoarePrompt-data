Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less than before), `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is the cumulative sum of all elements processed so far, including the current element, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum between the current value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. The other variables (`l`, `ele`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
