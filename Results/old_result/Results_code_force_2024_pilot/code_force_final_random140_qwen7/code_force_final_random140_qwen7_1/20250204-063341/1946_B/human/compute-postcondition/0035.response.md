Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `maxi`. Since `c` is initially 0 and the condition for `maxi` being the maximum of `c` and the absolute value of negative elements in `l` if `c` is less than or equal to those elements does not apply (as `maxi` is now set to 0), the value of `maxi` remains 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
