Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Maximum Positive Sum:**
   - The logic used to find `maxi` (the maximum positive sum) is flawed. It only considers the maximum sum of contiguous subarrays where elements are added up until a negative element is encountered. This approach does not account for the optimal way to maximize the sum using the operations allowed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Final Sum:**
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is not derived correctly from the problem statement. The idea of multiplying by `2 ** k` and subtracting `maxi` is not justified by the problem constraints and requirements.

3. **Handling Negative Elements:**
   - The code does not handle negative elements effectively. It should consider the sum of the array and how adding sums of subarrays can help in maximizing the total sum.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to understand that the optimal strategy involves making the array as positive as possible. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Sum the Array:**
   - Calculate the initial sum of the array.
   
2. **Use Operations Wisely:**
   - If there are negative numbers, you can use the operations to convert them into positive numbers. Specifically, you can sum subarrays containing these negative numbers and add their sum back into the array multiple times.

3. **Maximize the Sum:**
   - After performing the operations, the maximum possible sum would be the sum of the array plus the additional sums added through the operations.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the initial sum of the array
        initial_sum = sum(arr)
        
        # If the initial sum is negative, we can make it positive by adding the absolute value of the sum k times
        if initial_sum < 0:
            new_sum = (initial_sum + abs(initial_sum) * k) % MOD
        else:
            new_sum = (initial_sum + (k - 1) * initial_sum) % MOD
        
        print(new_sum)

func()
```

This approach ensures that the sum is maximized by leveraging the operations to convert negative values into positive ones, adhering to the problem constraints.
