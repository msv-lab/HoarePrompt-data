Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less than before), `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi` (which is `maxi` since `c` is 0).**

Explanation: The code sets `c` to 0, which resets the cumulative sum. The list `l` and its next element `ele` remain unchanged, and `maxi` remains the same because `c` is now 0 and does not affect the comparison.
