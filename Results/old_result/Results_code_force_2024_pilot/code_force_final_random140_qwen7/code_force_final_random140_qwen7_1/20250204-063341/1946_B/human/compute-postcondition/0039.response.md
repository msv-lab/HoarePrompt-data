Postcondition: `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 1`, and there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.
