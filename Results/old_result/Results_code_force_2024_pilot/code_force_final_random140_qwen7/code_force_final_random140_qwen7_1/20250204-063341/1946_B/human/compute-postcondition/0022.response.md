Output State: **`ele` is the third element of `l`, `l` must have at least one element, and `c` is equal to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value (`c`) and the previously stored maximum value (`maxi`). The value of `ele` and the condition that `l` must have at least one element remain unchanged. The value of `c` is updated to reflect the new maximum between itself and `maxi`.
