Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The variable `i` remains unchanged with its initial value of 0, and `t` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, and `n` and `k` are the integers input by the user.
