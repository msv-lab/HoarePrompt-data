Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least one element. If there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of each element `ele` in `l` that is greater than or equal to 0 or where `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.
