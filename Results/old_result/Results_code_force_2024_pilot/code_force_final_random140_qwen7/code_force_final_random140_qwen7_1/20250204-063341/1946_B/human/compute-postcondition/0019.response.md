Postcondition: `ele` is the second element of `l`, `l` must have at least one element, `c` is increased by `ele` if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`. Otherwise, `c` remains the same as the previous iteration's condition, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.
