Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l` that are greater than or equal to 0, or the maximum of `c` and the absolute value of negative elements in `l` if `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of those elements, `maxi` stores the highest value that `c` attains during the iterations where `c` is reset to 0 due to encountering a negative element in `l` that satisfies the condition `c <= abs(ele)`, and `l` is updated with a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `l`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, and `maxi` remain unchanged from their initial state.
