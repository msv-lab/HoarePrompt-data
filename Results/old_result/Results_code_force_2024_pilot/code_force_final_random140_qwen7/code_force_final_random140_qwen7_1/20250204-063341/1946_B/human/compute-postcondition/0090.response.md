Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `maxi` will hold the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`, considering all iterations where `c` is reset to 0 due to encountering a negative element in `l` that satisfies the condition `c <= abs(ele)`. The variable `c` will be reset to 0 whenever a negative element in `l` is encountered that meets the specified condition. The variable `sum(l)` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`. The variable `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` will be calculated and then taken modulo \(1000000007\). This final value will be printed for each test case.

The output state will be the result of the expression \((2^{k} \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007\) for each test case, after processing all the iterations of the loop.
