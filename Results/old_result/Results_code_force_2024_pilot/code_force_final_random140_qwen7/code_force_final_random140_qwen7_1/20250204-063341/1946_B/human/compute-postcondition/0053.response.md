Output State: **`c` is either 0 or the next element from the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`**.

Explanation: The line `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
