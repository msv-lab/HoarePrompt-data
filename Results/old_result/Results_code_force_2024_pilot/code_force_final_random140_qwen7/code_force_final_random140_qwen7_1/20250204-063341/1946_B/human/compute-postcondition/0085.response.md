Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element (one less than before), `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is the cumulative sum of all elements processed so far, including the current element, and `maxi` is updated based on the condition `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`. If `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `c` is 0 and `maxi` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele` and `maxi` is updated accordingly.**
