Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between the final value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`, `l` will be the list of integers as provided, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, and `i` is `k + n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum value between the current value of `c` and the initial value of `maxi`. The other variables (`l`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
