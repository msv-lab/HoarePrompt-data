Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `_rep` is used in the loop head.
   - The loop counter `t` is also part of the loop head.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.
   - The loop will continue as long as `_rep` is less than `t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\).
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` is an integer from the first input split.
   - `k` is an integer from the second input split.
   - If `n` is greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `_rep` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - If `n` is greater than `k`, no changes are made to `n`.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise (it is a constant for the entire loop).

5. **Determine the New State:**
   - If `n` is greater than `k`, then `n` remains the same.
   - `_rep` will be incremented by 1.
   - `t` remains the same.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- If `n` is greater than `k`, the state remains the same except for `_rep` which is incremented by 1.
- If `n` is not greater than `k`, the state remains the same except for `_rep` which is incremented by 1.

Since the problem does not specify whether `n` is greater than `k` or not, we assume the general case where `n` could be either greater than or equal to `k`.

**Final State:**
State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `k` is an integer from the second input split, `_rep` is incremented by 1.**

In summary, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `k` is an integer from the second input split, `_rep` is incremented by 1.**
