Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `k` is an integer from the second input split.**

The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged within the given constraints, and `t` remains at least 1. The new variables `n` and `k` are assigned the respective integers from the input.
