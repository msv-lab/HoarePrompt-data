Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
- `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\).
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_rep` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is an integer from the first input split.
- `k` is an integer from the second input split.

The print statement is simply `print('Bob')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'Bob'` without referencing any of the other variables, the output will be:

Output: **Bob**
