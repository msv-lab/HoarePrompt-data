State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `t` must be at least 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_rep` is initialized within the loop itself using `range(t)`, meaning the value of `_rep` is determined by the value of `t`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. Since `a` and `b` are not used to determine the loop's execution, their values do not need to be adjusted.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `t`, which must be at least 1.

Hence, the final state is: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `t` must be at least 1**.
