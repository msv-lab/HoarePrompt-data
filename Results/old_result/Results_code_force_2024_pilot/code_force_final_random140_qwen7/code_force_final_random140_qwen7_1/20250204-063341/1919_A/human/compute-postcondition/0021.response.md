Postcondition: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `t` must be at least 1, `_rep` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `k` is an integer from the second input split. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
