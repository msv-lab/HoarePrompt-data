Output State: `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `t` is an input integer that was initially set but is now exhausted after the loop runs `t` times, `_rep` is equal to `t` (the number of times the loop has executed), `n` and `k` are integers input from the user split by space and converted to an integer. After each iteration, if `n` is greater than `k`, `n` and `k` retain their values; otherwise, they also retain their values. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
