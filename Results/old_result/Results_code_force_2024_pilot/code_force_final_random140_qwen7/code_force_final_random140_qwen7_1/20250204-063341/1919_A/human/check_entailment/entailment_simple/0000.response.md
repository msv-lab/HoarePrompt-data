Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob when they play the game.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the given rules.
3. According to the problem, the key to winning is whether the number of coins in Alice's wallet (`a`) is greater than the number of coins in Bob's wallet (`b`). However, the solution incorrectly checks if `n > k` (which should be `a > b`) and prints 'Bob' if true, and 'Alice' if false. This is incorrect because it does not consider the parity (odd or even) of the difference between `a` and `b`.
4. The correct logic is that if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, Alice wins; if the difference is even, Bob wins. This is because the parity of the difference changes with each move, and the player who faces an even difference when it's their turn loses.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
