Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been increased by `k`.
   - `bottom_v` is 1.
   - `top_v` is reduced by 1.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
4. **Adjust the necessary states**: 
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`.

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been increased by `k`, we need to ensure that it is still less than `len(permutation)` for the loop to continue. Since `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `len(permutation)` is `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `n`.

State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is reduced by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`**.
