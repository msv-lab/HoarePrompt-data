Postcondition: `idx` is `k-1 + k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k-1 + k + 1`, `bottom_v` is either `(bottom_v + 1) + 1` or `2 + (n // 2)`, `top_v` is either `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v - 1`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `idx` remains as `k-1 + k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains as `k-1 + k + 1`, `bottom_v` is updated to either `(bottom_v + 1) + 1` or `2 + (n // 2)`, `top_v` remains as either `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is updated to either `bottom_v` or `top_v - 1`.
