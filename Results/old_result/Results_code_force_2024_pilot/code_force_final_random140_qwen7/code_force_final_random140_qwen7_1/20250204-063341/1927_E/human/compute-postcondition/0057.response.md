The initial state provides us with several conditions and values:
- `idx` is `k-1 + k`, which simplifies to `2*k - 1`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
- `bottom_v` is either `(bottom_v + 1) + 1` or `2 + (n // 2)`. This simplifies to `bottom_v + 2` or `2 + (n // 2)`.
- `top_v` is either `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`.
- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`.

The code `bottom_v += 1` increments `bottom_v` by 1. We need to consider the two possible values of `bottom_v`:

1. If `bottom_v` was initially `2 + (n // 2)`, then after incrementing, `bottom_v` becomes `3 + (n // 2)`.
2. If `bottom_v` was initially `bottom_v + 2`, then after incrementing, `bottom_v` becomes `bottom_v + 3`.

Since the exact initial value of `bottom_v` is not specified, we keep both possibilities. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is `2*k - 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `bottom_v` is either `3 + (n // 2)` or `bottom_v + 3`, `top_v` is either `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`**.
