Output State: **`idx` is `k-1 + k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k-1 + k + 1`, `bottom_v` is either `bottom_v + 1` or `1 + (n // 2)`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - 1`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is updated to `top_v - 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state of `top_v` was either `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`, after decrementing by 1, it becomes `n - (n // 2) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
