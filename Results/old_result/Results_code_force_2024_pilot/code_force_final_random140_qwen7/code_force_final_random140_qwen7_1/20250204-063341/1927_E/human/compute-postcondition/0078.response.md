Postcondition: `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, `idx` is less than `len(permutation)`, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1 if `idx` is even, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `bottom_v` if `idx` is even, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd.
