Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, where the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now `1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is reduced by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The other variables (`permutation`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, `top_v`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state and the code snippet provided.
