Output State: **`idx` is `k-1 + k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k-1 + k`, `bottom_v` is either `bottom_v + 1` or `1 + (n // 2)`, `top_v` is either `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`.**

This means that the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`, making it `k-1 + k`. The values of `idx`, `bottom_v`, `top_v`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` remain dependent on their original conditions regarding `k` and `n`.
