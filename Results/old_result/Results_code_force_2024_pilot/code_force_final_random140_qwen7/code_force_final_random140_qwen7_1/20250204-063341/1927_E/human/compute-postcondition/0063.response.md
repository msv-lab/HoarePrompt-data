Output State: `idx` is either `2*k - 1` or `k-1 + k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `len(permutation) - 1`, `bottom_v` is `3 + (n // 2)`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - 1`, and `permutation` is filled such that even indices are filled with increasing values starting from `1 + (n // 2)` and odd indices are filled with decreasing values starting from `n - (n // 2)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k` each iteration until it reaches the length of the `permutation` list. Since `idx` starts at `k-1` and increments by `k` each time, it will either stay as `k-1 + k` or reset to `k-1` when it hits an odd index, but in the final iteration, it won't matter as the loop condition will no longer be satisfied. The `bottom_v` starts at `1 + (n // 2)` and increases by 1 each even iteration, while `top_v` starts at `n - (n // 2)` and decreases by 1 each odd iteration. After all iterations, `bottom_v` will be `3 + (n // 2)` and `top_v` will be `n - (n // 2) - 1`. The `permutation` list will be filled according to the rules given in the loop body, with even indices containing increasing values and odd indices containing decreasing values.
