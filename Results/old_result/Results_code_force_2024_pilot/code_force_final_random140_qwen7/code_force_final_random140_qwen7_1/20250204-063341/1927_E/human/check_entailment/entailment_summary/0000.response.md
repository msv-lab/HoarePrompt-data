Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n.
2. A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is no more than 1.
3. The provided code has two functions:
   - `func_1()`: Constructs a permutation for a single test case.
   - `func_2()`: Processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

4. Let's analyze `func_1()`:
   - It initializes a permutation list of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - It uses two pointers, `bottom_v` starting at 1 and `top_v` starting at `n`, to fill the permutation list.
   - It alternates between filling the list with increasing and decreasing values, ensuring a balanced distribution.
   - This approach helps in creating a permutation where the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will be close to each other due to the alternating pattern.

5. Now, let's consider the construction of the permutation:
   - The alternating pattern ensures that the values in the permutation are spread out evenly, which helps in minimizing the difference between the sums of any continuous segment of length `k`.
   - Since `k` is even, the pattern ensures that the sums of any two consecutive segments of length `k` will be very close to each other, satisfying the k-level condition.

6. The `func_2()` function correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summaries, the functions together meet the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
