Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, `idx` is an even number and less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced by `bottom_v`.**

Explanation: The code replaces the element at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` in the list `permutation` with the value `bottom_v`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, the element at index `idx` in `permutation` is now `bottom_v`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
