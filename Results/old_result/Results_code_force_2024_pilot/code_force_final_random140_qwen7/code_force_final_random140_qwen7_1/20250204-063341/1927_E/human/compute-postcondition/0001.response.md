Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
