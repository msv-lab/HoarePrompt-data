Postcondition: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to a value within the bounds of `permutation` (i.e., less than `len(permutation)`), `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to either `bottom_v` or `top_v`, `bottom_v` is incremented if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was updated due to the if condition, and `top_v` is decremented if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was updated due to the else condition.**
