Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `permutation` is a list of n zeros, `n` is an integer input split from the first space-separated value, `k` is an integer input split from the second space-separated value, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is n, `idx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while idx < k:
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
    while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
        if idx % 2 == 0:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
            bottom_v += 1
        else:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
            top_v -= 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
    idx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is increased by 1, the permutation list follows the alternating pattern starting from 1 and going up to n, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `n-1`, `bottom_v` is `1 + (n // 2)`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)` if n is either odd or even.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `idx` is `k-1 + k * (len(permutation) // k) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `len(permutation) - 1`, `bottom_v` is `1 + (n // 2) + len(permutation) // 2`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - len(permutation) // 2`, and `permutation` is filled such that even indices are assigned values from `bottom_v` upwards and odd indices are assigned values from `top_v` downwards until all elements are assigned.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `idx` is incremented by 1. The loop continues to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`. The final state of the `permutation` list will have its elements set according to the described pattern, with `bottom_v` and `top_v` being incremented and decremented respectively as per the conditions inside the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
