Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means `t` now holds the number of test cases, but the values of `n` and `k` remain undefined as they haven't been assigned any values yet. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer and represents the number of test cases is preserved.
