Based on the initial state provided, `result` is a string containing the permutation list elements separated by spaces, with each element converted to a string. Since no specific permutation or values are given, we can only describe the general form of what `result` would look like.

For example, if the permutation list was `[1, 2, 3]`, then `result` would be `"1 2 3"`. If the permutation list was `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `result` would be `"a b c"`.

Given this, the `print(result)` statement will output the string representation of the permutation list elements separated by spaces.

Output: **the permutation list elements separated by spaces (each element converted to a string)**
