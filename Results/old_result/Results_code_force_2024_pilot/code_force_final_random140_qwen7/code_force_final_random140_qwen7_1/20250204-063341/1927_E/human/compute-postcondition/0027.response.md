Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1` and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `top_v`.**

Explanation: The code updates `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by incrementing it by 1 and assigns `top_v` to the position in the `permutation` list indicated by the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation) - k` remains valid after the update.
