Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even, and returns information based on these values.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any direct parameters but handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` under specific conditions (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even) and provides some form of output based on these values.
