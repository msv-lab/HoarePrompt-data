Output State: **`idx` is `k-1 + k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k-1 + k + 1 + k`, `bottom_v` is either `(bottom_v + 1) + 1` or `2 + (n // 2)`, `top_v` is either `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was previously `k-1 + k + 1`, adding `k` to it results in `k-1 + k + 1 + k`. The values of `idx`, `bottom_v`, `top_v`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions as specified in the precondition.
