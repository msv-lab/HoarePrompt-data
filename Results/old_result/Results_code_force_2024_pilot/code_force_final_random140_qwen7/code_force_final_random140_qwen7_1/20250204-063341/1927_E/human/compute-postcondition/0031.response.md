Output State: The `permutation` list will be filled with alternating values starting from `1` up to `n`. Specifically, the even indices (0-based) will contain the smallest remaining value of `bottom_v`, and the odd indices will contain the largest remaining value of `top_v`. After all iterations, `bottom_v` will equal `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 + 1` or `n // 2` depending on whether `n` is even or odd, and `top_v` will be `n // 2`.

To break it down further:
- If `n` is even, the final `bottom_v` will be `n // 2 + 1` and `top_v` will be `n // 2`.
- If `n` is odd, the final `bottom_v` will be `n // 2 + 1` and `top_v` will be `n // 2`.

The `permutation` list will look like this:
- For even `n`: `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-3, ..., n//2, n//2+1]`
- For odd `n`: `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-3, ..., n//2, n//2+1]` or `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-3, ..., n//2, n//2]`

The `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` variable will be equal to `n - 1` after the loop completes, as it increments by `k` each iteration until it reaches or exceeds the length of the `permutation` list.
