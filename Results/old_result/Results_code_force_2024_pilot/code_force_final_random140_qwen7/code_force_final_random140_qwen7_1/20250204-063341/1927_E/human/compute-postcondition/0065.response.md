Output State: **`idx` is `k-1 + k * (len(permutation) // k) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `len(permutation) - 1`, `bottom_v` is `1 + (n // 2) + len(permutation) // 2`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - len(permutation) // 2`, and `permutation` is filled such that even indices are assigned values from `bottom_v` upwards and odd indices are assigned values from `top_v` downwards until all elements are assigned.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` was previously set to `k-1 + k * (len(permutation) // k)`. After executing `idx += 1`, `idx` is now `k-1 + k * (len(permutation) // k) + 1`. The other variables (`multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, `bottom_v`, `top_v`, and `permutation`) remain unchanged because the code snippet only modifies `idx`.
