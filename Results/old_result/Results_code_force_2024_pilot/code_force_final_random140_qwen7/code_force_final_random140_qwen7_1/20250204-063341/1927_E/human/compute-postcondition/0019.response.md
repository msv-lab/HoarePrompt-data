Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with one element replaced by `top_v` at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is reduced by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.**

This means that the `permutation` list has one zero replaced by `top_v` at the index specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`, while `bottom_v` remains 1 and `top_v` is now `top_v - 1`. The condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n` still holds.
