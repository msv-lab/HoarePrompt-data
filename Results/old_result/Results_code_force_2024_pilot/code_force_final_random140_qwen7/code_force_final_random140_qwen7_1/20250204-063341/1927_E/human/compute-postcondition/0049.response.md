`bottom_v` is incremented by 1. Initially, `bottom_v` is either `bottom_v + 1` or `1 + (n // 2)`. After incrementing, `bottom_v` becomes either `(bottom_v + 1) + 1` or `1 + (n // 2) + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is `k-1 + k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k-1 + k + 1`, `bottom_v` is either `(bottom_v + 1) + 1` or `2 + (n // 2)`, `top_v` is either `n - (n // 2)` or `n - (n // 2) - 1`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`**
