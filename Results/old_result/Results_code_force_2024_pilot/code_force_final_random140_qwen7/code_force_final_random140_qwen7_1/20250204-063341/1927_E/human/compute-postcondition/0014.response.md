Postcondition: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros. If `idx` is even (i.e., `idx % 2 == 0`), the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is set to `bottom_v`, which is 2. Otherwise, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is set to `n`, and `bottom_v` is adjusted to 1 while `top_v` is reduced by 1.**
