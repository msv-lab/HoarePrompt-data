Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `bottom_v` is increased by 1 if `idx % 2 == 0`, and `top_v` is decreased by 1 if `idx % 2 != 0`.**

This means that the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`. If `idx` is even (`idx % 2 == 0`), then `bottom_v` has been incremented by 1, and if `idx` is odd (`idx % 2 != 0`), then `top_v` has been decremented by 1. The conditions and updates to `permutation` based on the parity of `idx` remain unchanged.
