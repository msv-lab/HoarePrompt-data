Output State: `t` is equal to 0.

Natural Language Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be reduced by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, once `t` becomes 0, the loop stops. Therefore, the final state of `t` is 0.
