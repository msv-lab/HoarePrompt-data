Based on the initial state provided:

- `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
- `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`.
- `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`.
- The number of 'A's (`countA`) is less than or equal to the number of 'B's (`countB`).
- The current value of `countB` is greater than the current value of `countA`.

The print statement is simply `print('B')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string 'B', regardless of the values of `userString`, `countA`, and `countB`, the output will be:

Output: **B**
