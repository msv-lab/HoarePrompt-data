Postcondition: `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the third character of `userString`. If the third character (`letter`) is 'A', `countA` is 2 and `countB` is 1. If the third character (`letter`) is 'B', `countA` is 1 and `countB` is 2 if it was 'B' previously, otherwise it remains 1.
