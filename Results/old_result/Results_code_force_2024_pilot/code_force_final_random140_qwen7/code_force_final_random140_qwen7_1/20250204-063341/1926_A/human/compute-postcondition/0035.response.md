Based on the initial state provided:

- `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
- `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`.
- `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`.
- The condition `countA` is greater than `countB` holds true.

The print statement is simply `print('A')`.

Since the print statement directly prints the string `'A'`, regardless of the values of `userString`, `countA`, and `countB`, the output will be:

Output: **A**
