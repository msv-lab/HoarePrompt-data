Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the third character of `userString`, `countA` is 2 if the second character was 'A', `countB` is 1 if the second character was 'B'**.

Explanation: The code `countA += 1` increments the value of `countA` by 1. Since the initial value of `countA` is 1 if the second character of `userString` was 'A', after executing the code, `countA` will be 2 if the second character was 'A'. The values of `userString`, `letter`, and `countB` remain unchanged.
