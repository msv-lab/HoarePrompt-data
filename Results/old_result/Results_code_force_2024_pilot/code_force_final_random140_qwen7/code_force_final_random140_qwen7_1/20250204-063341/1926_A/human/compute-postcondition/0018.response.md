Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the second character of `userString`, `countA` is 1**.

Explanation: The initial state is that `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', and `letter` is the second character of `userString`. The code increments `countA` by 1, which means `countA` now equals 1. The values of `userString` and `letter` remain unchanged.
