Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `a`, `i`, `l`, and `h`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `a`. After each iteration, `j` takes the next character from the string `a`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `a`: Since `j` is iterating through the string `a`, the length of `a` does not change, but the value of `a` itself will be one character shorter after each iteration.
   - `i`: The problem statement mentions that `i` is incremented by 1, but it is not directly related to the loop head. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` here.
   - `l`: This variable counts the number of 'A' characters in `a`. Each time a character is processed, if it is an 'A', `l` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - `h`: This variable counts the number of non-'A' characters in `a`. Each time a character is processed, if it is not an 'A', `h` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `a`: Since `j` is processing one character from `a` in each iteration, `a` will be one character shorter.
   - `l` and `h`: These values remain the same unless the current character `j` is an 'A' or not.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` is a non-empty string, but one character shorter than before.
- `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A' (either incremented by 1 or unchanged).
- `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A' (either incremented by 1 or unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, one character shorter than before, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A' (either incremented by 1 or unchanged), and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A' (either incremented by 1 or unchanged)**.
