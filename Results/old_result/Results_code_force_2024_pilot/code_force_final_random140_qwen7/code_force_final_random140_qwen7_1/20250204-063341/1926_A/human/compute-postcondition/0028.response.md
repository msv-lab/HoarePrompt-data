Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the third character of `userString`, `countA` is 1 if the second character was 'A', `countB` is 1 if the second character was 'B', we continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `userString`, `letter`, `countA`, and `countB` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
