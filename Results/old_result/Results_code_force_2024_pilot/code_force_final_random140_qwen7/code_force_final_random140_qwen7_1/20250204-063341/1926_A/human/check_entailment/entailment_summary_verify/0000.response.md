Reasoning: 

The original assessment is partially accurate but not entirely correct. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Function Logic and Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the input string.
   - The function prints 'A' if there are more 'A's, 'B' if there are more 'B's, and does nothing if the counts are equal (though the function does not explicitly handle the tie case, it implicitly handles it by not printing anything).

2. **Unnecessary Code**:
   - The line `list(userString)` is indeed unnecessary and does not affect the outcome. It converts the string into a list, which is not required for the counting process.

3. **Tie Handling**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function does not explicitly handle the tie case. However, since the problem guarantees that the input string will only contain 'A' and 'B', the tie case (i.e., `countA == countB`) cannot occur. Therefore, the function will always print either 'A' or 'B'.

4. **Correctness of the Provided Code**:
   - The provided code correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
   - It prints 'A' if `countA` is greater than or equal to `countB`, and 'B' otherwise.
   - This logic ensures that the correct character is printed based on its frequency in the input string.

Given these points, the provided code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The original assessment was overly critical about the tie handling, which is not necessary due to the problem constraints.

Final: **True**
