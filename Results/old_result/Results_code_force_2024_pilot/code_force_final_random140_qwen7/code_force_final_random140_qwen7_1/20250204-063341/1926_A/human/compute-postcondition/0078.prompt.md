Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a new string input from the user, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A', `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A', `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is the same as before.
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j in 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A' (either incremented by 1 if `j` is 'A' or unchanged if `j` is not 'A'), `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A' (either incremented by 1 if `j` is not 'A' or unchanged if `j` is 'A'), `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is the same as before.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A' (either incremented by 1 or unchanged), and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A' (either incremented by 1 or unchanged).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string, one character shorter than before, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A' (either incremented by 1 or unchanged), and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A' (either incremented by 1 or unchanged). If the character `j` is 'A', then `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
