You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings:
    func_1(userString)

def func_1(userString):
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
    if countA > countB:
        print('A')
    elif countB > countA:
        print('B')
    else:
        pass



- Annotated Code: 
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings:
    func_1(userString)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func_1(userString):
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`, and `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`.
    if (countA > countB) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        if (countB > countA) :
            print('B')
            #This is printed: B
        else :
            pass
        #State: Postcondition: `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`, and `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`. After executing the if-else block, the number of 'B's (`countB`) is greater than or equal to the number of 'A's (`countA`).
    #State: Postcondition: `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`, and `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`. After executing the if-else block, either `countA` is greater than `countB` or `countB` is greater than or equal to `countA`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program is designed to handle a list of strings (`userStrings`), where each string represents a test case. This matches the problem description which states there will be multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to process each string individually. It takes a single string `userString` as an argument.

3. **Character Counting**:
   - The program initializes two counters, `countA` and `countB`, to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the string and increments the appropriate counter based on whether the character is 'A' or 'B'.
   - The `else` clause in the `if-elif-else` statement is unnecessary because the loop will only execute when the character is either 'A' or 'B'.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares the counts.
   - If `countA` is greater than `countB`, it prints 'A'.
   - If `countB` is greater than `countA`, it prints 'B'.
   - If both counts are equal, it does nothing (the `else` block is empty).

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases match the expected input format and the function correctly processes each string to determine the more frequent character.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all possible combinations of 'A' and 'B' in the strings correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the number of 'A's and 'B's is equal by not printing anything (though the problem statement does not explicitly mention handling this case, the program behaves correctly).

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each string.
