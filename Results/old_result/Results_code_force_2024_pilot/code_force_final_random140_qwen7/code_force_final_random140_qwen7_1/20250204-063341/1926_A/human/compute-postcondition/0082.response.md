Postcondition: `a` is an empty string, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed (which is the length of the original string `a`), `l` is the total count of characters in the original string `a` that are 'A', and `h` is the total count of characters in the original string `a` that are not 'A'. **The count of characters 'A' (`l`) is less than or equal to the count of characters not 'A' (`h`).**
