Postcondition: `a` is an empty string, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed (which is the length of the original string `a`), `l` is the total count of characters in the original string `a` that are 'A', and `h` is the total count of characters in the original string `a` that are not 'A'. **`l` is less than or equal to `h`**.
