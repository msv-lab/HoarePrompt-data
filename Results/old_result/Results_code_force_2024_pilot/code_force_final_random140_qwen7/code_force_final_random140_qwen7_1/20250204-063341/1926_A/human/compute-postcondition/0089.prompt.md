Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive; `l` is 0; `h` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a = str(input())
    for j in a:
        if j in 'A':
            l += 1
        else:
            h += 1
    if l > h:
        print('A')
    elif l < h:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a string input from the user, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in 'A', and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in 'A'. The condition `l > h` holds true if `l` is greater than `h`; otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a new string input from the user, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A', and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A'. Throughout the entire execution of the loop, the number of 'A's in `a` is always compared to the number of non-'A' characters, and the condition `l > h` either holds true or becomes false based on the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an empty string, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed (which is the length of the original string `a`), `l` is the total count of characters in the original string `a` that are 'A', and `h` is the total count of characters in the original string `a` that are not 'A'. If the count of characters 'A' (`l`) is greater than the count of characters not 'A' (`h`), the condition `l > h` is true. Otherwise, the count of characters 'A' (`l`) is less than or equal to the count of characters not 'A' (`h`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
