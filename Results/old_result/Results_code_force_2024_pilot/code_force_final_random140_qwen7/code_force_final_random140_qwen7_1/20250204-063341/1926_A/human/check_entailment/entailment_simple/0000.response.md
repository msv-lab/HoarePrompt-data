### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input strings, which are all of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B'.
2. **Counting Characters**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string.
3. **Conditional Logic**: The logic inside `func_1` correctly determines which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in the string and prints it accordingly.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where `countA` equals `countB`, but since the problem statement specifies that the strings are distinct and of length 5, this scenario should not occur (as there would be no way to have exactly 2.5 'A's and 2.5 'B's). Therefore, the `else` block with `pass` is unnecessary and redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.
5. **Output**: The program produces the correct output for each test case as per the example provided.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
