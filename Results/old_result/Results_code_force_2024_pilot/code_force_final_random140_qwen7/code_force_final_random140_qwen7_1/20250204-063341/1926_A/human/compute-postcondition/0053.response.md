Postcondition: **`a` is a new string input from the user, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in 'A', and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in 'A'. Throughout the entire execution of the loop, the number of 'A's in `a` has never been greater than the number of non-'A' characters.**
