Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `test_cases` and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

4. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop counter `_` is an underscore, it is not explicitly incremented or modified within the loop, but `test_cases` itself could be decremented.

5. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `test_cases` must remain greater than 0. Therefore, `test_cases` should be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 0.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1**.
