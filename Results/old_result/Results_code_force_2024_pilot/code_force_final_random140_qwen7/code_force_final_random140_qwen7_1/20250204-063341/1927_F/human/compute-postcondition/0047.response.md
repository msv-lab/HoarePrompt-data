Output State: **`w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`.**

The code `parent_v = dsu.find(v)` finds the root of the component containing `v` and assigns it to `parent_v`. The values of `w`, `u`, `v`, and `parent_u` remain unchanged.
