Postcondition: **`que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the value of `end` from the previous iteration, `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, and `prev[nei]` equals `node`. This holds whether `nei` is not in `prev` or not, as the else part does not change the state.**
