Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple cycles with the same minimal edge weight exist. Specifically, the program stops as soon as it finds a cycle, but it does not guarantee that the cycle found has the minimal weight among all possible cycles.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following test case:

```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
```

In this case, there are three cycles: (1-2-3), (1-3-2), and (2-3-1). All these cycles have the same minimal edge weight of 1. The program will output one of these cycles, but it does not ensure that the cycle with the minimal weight is chosen. For instance, it might output (1-2-3), but it could also output (2-3-1) or (1-3-2).

Since the program does not guarantee finding the cycle with the minimal weight among all possible cycles, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
