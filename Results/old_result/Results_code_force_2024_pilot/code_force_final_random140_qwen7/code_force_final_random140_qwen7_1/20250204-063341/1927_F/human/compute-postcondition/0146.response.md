Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for nei in graph[node]:`. The key variables here are `nei`, `node`, and `graph`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `graph[node]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `graph[node]` had at least one element remaining.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - **`node`**: This variable remains unchanged within the loop body since it is used as the starting point for each iteration of the loop.
   - **`nei`**: This variable changes with each iteration of the loop, taking on the value of the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.
   - **`graph`**: The structure of `graph` remains unchanged; however, the state of `graph[node]` changes as elements are removed from it.

4. **Postconditions and Adjustments**:
   - After each iteration, `nei` is checked against `prev`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`, and `nei` is appended to `que`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `graph[node]` must still have at least one element remaining.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- `node` remains the same.
- `nei` will be the next neighbor in `graph[node]` (the first element that was not processed in the previous iteration).
- `graph[node]` must still have at least one element remaining.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`**.
