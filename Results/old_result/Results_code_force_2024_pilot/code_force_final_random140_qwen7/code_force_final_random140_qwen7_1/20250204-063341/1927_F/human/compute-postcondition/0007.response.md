Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` must be at least 3, as it needs to be greater than 2 (from the output state after 3 iterations) to complete all required iterations. Since the loop runs `test_cases` times and we know it ran at least 3 times, `test_cases` cannot be less than 3. Therefore, the final value of `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 3.
