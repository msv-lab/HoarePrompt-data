Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.
2. The provided code consists of several functions, but the core logic is implemented in `func_6`, which is responsible for constructing the graph, finding the minimum spanning tree (MST), and identifying the desired cycle.
3. `func_6` correctly initializes the graph and reads the edges.
4. It sorts the edges in descending order of weight and uses a DSU to build the MST.
5. After constructing the MST, it performs a BFS to find the shortest path from a specified start node to an end node, which helps in identifying the cycle.
6. The function prints the weight of the last edge processed during MST construction and the length of the shortest path, followed by printing the shortest path itself in reverse order.
7. `func_7` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case.
8. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided code should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.

Based on the above analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
