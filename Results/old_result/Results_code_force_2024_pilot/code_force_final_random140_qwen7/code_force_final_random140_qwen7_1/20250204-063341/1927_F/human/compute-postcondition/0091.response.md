Output State: **`que` is a deque with one less element, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que`, `prev` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. In this case, it indicates that we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were inside, without changing the values of the variables `que`, `node`, and `prev`.
