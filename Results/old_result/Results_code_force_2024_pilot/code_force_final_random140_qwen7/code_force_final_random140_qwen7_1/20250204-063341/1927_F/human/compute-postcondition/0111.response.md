Output State: **`que` is a deque with one more element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the value of `end` from the previous iteration, `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, and `prev[nei]` equals `node`.**

Explanation: The code appends `nei` to the deque `que`. This increases the number of elements in `que` by one. All other variables remain unchanged, with `node` being the next neighbor of the current node in the graph, `nei` being the value of `end` from the previous iteration, and `prev[nei]` being updated to the current `node`.
