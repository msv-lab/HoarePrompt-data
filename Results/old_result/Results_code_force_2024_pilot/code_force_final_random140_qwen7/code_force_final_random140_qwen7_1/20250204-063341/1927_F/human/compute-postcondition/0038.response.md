Output State: **`parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU object `dsu`, `w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, `parent_u` is updated to the root of `u` found by `dsu.find(u)`**.

In this output state, the variable `parent_u` has been updated to the root of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method call. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
