Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for nei in graph[node]:`. The variables involved here are `nei` and `node`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `graph[node]`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `graph[node]` has at least one element.
   - `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`.
   - `nei` is added to `que` as its last element.
   - If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `nei` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, it will be the next node to process.
   - `node` will remain the same as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `graph[node]` will lose one element (the current `nei`), but since it had at least one element, it will still have at least one element left for the next iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `node` remains the same.
- `graph[node]` loses one element but still has at least one element.
- `nei` becomes the next element in `graph[node]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `graph[node]` has at least one element, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, and `nei` is the next element in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.**
