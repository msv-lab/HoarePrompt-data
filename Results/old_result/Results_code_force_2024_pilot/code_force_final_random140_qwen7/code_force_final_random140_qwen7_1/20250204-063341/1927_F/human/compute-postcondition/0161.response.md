The loop condition is `curr != -1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `curr` must be a valid node (not equal to -1) and should have a predecessor in the shortest path tree.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `que` is an empty deque.
- `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty.
- The dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`.
- The variable `curr` is updated to the predecessor of `end` in the shortest path tree.
- The final `node` equals `end`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `curr` must be a valid node (not equal to -1). Since `curr` is set to the predecessor of `end` in the shortest path tree, and assuming the shortest path tree is correctly constructed, `curr` should not be -1. However, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to confirm that `curr` is indeed a valid node in the shortest path tree.

Given the information, no adjustments are necessary to the states of `que`, `node`, `prev`, or `end` because these states do not affect the loop condition directly. The only state that needs to be ensured is that `curr` is not -1, which is already implied by the loop condition.

Therefore, the state remains as provided:

State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, the variable `curr` is updated to the predecessor of `end` in the shortest path tree, and the final `node` equals `end`.**
