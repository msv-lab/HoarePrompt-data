Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge in an undirected weighted graph. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs the graph using an adjacency list representation. It reads the edges and adds them to the graph, ensuring that both endpoints of each edge are added to each other's adjacency lists.

2. **Edge Sorting and Union-Find Initialization**: The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. A union-find data structure (DSU) is initialized to keep track of connected components.

3. **Finding the Minimal Weight Cycle**: The program iterates over the sorted edges. When it finds a cycle (i.e., two vertices belong to the same connected component), it records the weight of the current edge as the potential minimal weight and updates the start and end vertices of the cycle. This ensures that the first cycle found with the smallest edge weight is recorded.

4. **Path Reconstruction**: Using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, the program reconstructs the path from the start vertex to the end vertex, forming the cycle. The path is then reversed to get the correct traversal order.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimal edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in the cycle in traversal order.

Given the provided functions and the overall logic, the program correctly handles the problem requirements. It processes each test case appropriately and outputs the required information for each case.

Correctness: **True**
