Output State: **`que` is a deque with one less element, `node` is the first element that was removed from `que` and has the value `start`, `nei` is the value `end`, and `prev[nei]` is updated to `node`.**

Explanation: The code `prev[nei] = node` updates the dictionary `prev` such that the key `nei` now maps to the value `node`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
