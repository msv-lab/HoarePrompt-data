Output State: **_min_edge is w, `w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `w` (which is the weight of the next edge) to the variable `_min_edge`. All other variables (`u`, `v`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`) remain unchanged.
