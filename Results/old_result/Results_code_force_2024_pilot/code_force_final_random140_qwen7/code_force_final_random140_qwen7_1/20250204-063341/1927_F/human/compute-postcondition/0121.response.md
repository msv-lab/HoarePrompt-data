Output State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last element that was removed from `que` before `que` became empty, `prev` is a dictionary containing the shortest path from `start` to every node in the graph that was reachable within the given constraints, and if the final `node` equals `end`, the loop would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `que` will be empty since it loses one element per iteration and starts with more elements than it ends up with. The `node` variable will hold the last node that was popped from `que` before it became empty. The `prev` dictionary will contain the shortest path information from `start` to all nodes that were processed, with each key-value pair representing a node and its predecessor on the shortest path. If the final `node` is `end`, it indicates that the path from `start` to `end` was successfully found during the loop's execution.
