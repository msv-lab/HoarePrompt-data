Output State: **`que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the value of `end` from the previous iteration, `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. No variables are reassigned or altered by this statement, so the values of `que`, `node`, `nei`, and `prev[nei]` remain unchanged from their previous states. The loop continues to execute.
