Based on the initial state provided:

- `que` is an empty deque.
- `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty.
- `prev` is a dictionary containing the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`.
- `curr` is set to `prev[curr]` until it becomes `-1`, indicating that the shortest path has been fully traced back.
- `path` is a list containing the shortest path from `end` to `start` in reverse order.

Given these conditions, when the code `print(*path[::-1])` is executed, it will print the elements of the `path` list in their original order (since `[::-1]` reverses the list and then `*` is used to unpack the list into separate arguments for the print function).

Since `path` contains the shortest path from `end` to `start` in reverse order, and `prev` contains the predecessors needed to reconstruct this path, the `path` list will be constructed correctly.

Therefore, the output will be the shortest path from `end` to `start` in the correct order.

Output: **the shortest path from end to start**
