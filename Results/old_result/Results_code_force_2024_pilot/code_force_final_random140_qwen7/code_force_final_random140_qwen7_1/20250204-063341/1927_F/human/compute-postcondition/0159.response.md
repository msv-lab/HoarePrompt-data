Output State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, the variable `path` contains the current node `end`, `curr` is set to `end`, and the final `node` equals `end`.**

The code `path.append(curr)` appends the current node (`end`) to the `path` list. Since `curr` is set to `end`, the `path` list now includes `end`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
