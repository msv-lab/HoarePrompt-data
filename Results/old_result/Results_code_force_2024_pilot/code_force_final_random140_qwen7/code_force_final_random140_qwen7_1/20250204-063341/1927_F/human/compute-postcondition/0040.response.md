Output State: **_min_edge is w, `parent_v` is updated to the root of `v`, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`, `parent_v` is updated to the root of `v` found by `dsu.find(v)`, `w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `w` to `_min_edge`. Additionally, `parent_v` is updated to the root of `v` found by `dsu.find(v)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
