Output State: **`graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `prev[nei]` is `node`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `node` to `prev[nei]`, meaning that `prev[nei]` now holds the value of `node`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
