Output State: **`node` remains the same, `nei` becomes the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary, `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, `que` contains the new `nei` and `nei` is added to it.**

This means that at the start of the next iteration of the loop:
- The value of `node` remains unchanged.
- `nei` is set to the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.
- `prev[nei]` is updated to the current value of `node`.
- `que` now contains the new `nei` and `nei` itself is added to `que`.
