Output State: **`prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`, `graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**

In this output state, the variable `prev[nei]` is updated to hold the value of `node`. All other variables (`graph[node]`, `node`, `nei`, and their conditions) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
