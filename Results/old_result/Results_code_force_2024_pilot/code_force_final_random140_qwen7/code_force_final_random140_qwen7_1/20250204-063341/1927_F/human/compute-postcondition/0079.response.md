Postcondition: **`node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `prev[nei]` is now assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` and `nei` added to it; `nei` is now the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary. This remains true whether `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, or not. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `nei` is already in `prev` or not, after executing the if-else block, `prev[nei]` will be assigned the value of `node`, `que` will contain `nei` twice, and `nei` will be the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.
