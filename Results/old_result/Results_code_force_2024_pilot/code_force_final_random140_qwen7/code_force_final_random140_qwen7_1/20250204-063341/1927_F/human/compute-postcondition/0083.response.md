Output State: **`node` remains the same, `nei` becomes the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary, `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, and `que` now contains the new `nei` and `nei` is added to it.**

This means that the variable `prev[nei]` is updated to the current value of `node`, and the variable `que` now includes the newly added `nei`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
