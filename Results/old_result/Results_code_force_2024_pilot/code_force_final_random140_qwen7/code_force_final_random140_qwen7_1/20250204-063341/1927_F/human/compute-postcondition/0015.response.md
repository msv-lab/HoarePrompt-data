Output State: **`i` is 2, `i` must be less than `m`, `u` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `v` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `w` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `graph[u]` now includes `v` and `v` is appended to `graph[u]`, `graph[v]` now includes `u` and `u` is appended to `graph[v]`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)` and the tuple `(w, u, v)` is appended.**

Explanation: The code appends `v` to `graph[u]` and `u` to `graph[v]`. Since `u` and `v` are the values returned by `func_3()`, their values remain unchanged. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `w`, and `edges`) also remain unchanged.
