Output State: All edges in the `edges` list have been processed, and the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) operations have merged all connected components. The variable `start` will hold the starting vertex of the minimum spanning tree (MST), and `end` will hold the ending vertex of the MST. `_min_edge` will store the weight of the last edge added to the MST. If no cycle was formed during the process (which would mean all vertices are connected), `_min_edge` will contain the weight of the last edge that was added to ensure all vertices are part of a single connected component. If a cycle was detected, `_min_edge` will contain the weight of the lightest edge that caused the cycle, and `start` and `end` will indicate the vertices involved in that cycle.

The `parent_u` and `parent_v` variables will reflect the ultimate root of the components that were originally `u` and `v`, respectively, after all possible unions have taken place. The `w`, `u`, and `v` variables will not be relevant since the loop has completed, and they will hold the values of the last edge processed, which did not form a cycle or was the last edge processed before the loop ended.
