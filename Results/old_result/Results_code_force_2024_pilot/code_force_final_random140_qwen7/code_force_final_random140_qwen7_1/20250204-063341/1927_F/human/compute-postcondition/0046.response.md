Output State: **`w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`.**

Explanation: The line `parent_u = dsu.find(u)` finds the root (or the representative) of the connected component that contains the node `u`. This operation does not change the values of `w`, `u`, or `v`, but it assigns the root of the component containing `u` to the variable `parent_u`.
