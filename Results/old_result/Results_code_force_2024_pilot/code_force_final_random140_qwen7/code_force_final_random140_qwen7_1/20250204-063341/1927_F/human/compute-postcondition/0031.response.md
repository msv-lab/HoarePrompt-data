Output State: **_min_edge is w, parent_u is the root of u in the DSU object dsu, parent_v is the root of v in the DSU object dsu, start is u**.

Explanation: The code `start = u` assigns the value of `u` to the variable `start`. No other variables are affected, so `_min_edge`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` retain their previous values.
