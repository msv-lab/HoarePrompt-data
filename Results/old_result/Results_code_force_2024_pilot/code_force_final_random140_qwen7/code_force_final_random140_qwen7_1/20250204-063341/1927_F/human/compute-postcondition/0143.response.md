Output State: **`prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`, `graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `que` now has `nei` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends `nei` to the end of the list `que`. All other variables retain their previous values. Specifically, `prev[nei]` is still assigned the value of `node`, `graph[node]` still has at least one element remaining, `node` is still the element that was removed from the front of `que`, and `nei` is still the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.
