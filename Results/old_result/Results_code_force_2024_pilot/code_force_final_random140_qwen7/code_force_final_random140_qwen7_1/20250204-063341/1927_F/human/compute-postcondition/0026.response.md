Output State: **`parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`; `end` is -1; `_min_edge` is positive infinity (float('inf')); `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements; `i` is equal to `m - 1`; `i` is still less than `m`; `u` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration; `v` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration; `w` holds the value returned by `func_3()` on the last iteration; the `graph` dictionary has updated its adjacency lists such that for every edge added, both vertices `u` and `v` have each other in their respective adjacency lists; the `edges` list contains tuples `(w, u, v)` for each of the `m` edges added during the loop's iterations; the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weight `w` of the edges; `start` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `parent_u = dsu.find(u)` finds the root of vertex `u` in the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) object `dsu`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
