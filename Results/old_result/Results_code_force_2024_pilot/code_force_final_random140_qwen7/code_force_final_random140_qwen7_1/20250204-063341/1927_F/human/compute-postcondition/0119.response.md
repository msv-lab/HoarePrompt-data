Postcondition: `que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the next neighbor being processed, and `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` has one more element than before.
