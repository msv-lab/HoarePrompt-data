Output State: **`i` is 2, `i` must be less than `m`, `u` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `v` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `w` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `graph[u]` now includes `v` and `v` is appended to `graph[u]`, `graph[v]` now includes `u` and `u` is appended to `graph[v]`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)` and the tuple `(w, u, v)` is appended, `graph[v].append(u)`**

Explanation: The code appends `u` to the list `graph[v]`. Since `graph[v]` already contains `u` (as per the initial state), appending `u` again does not change its content. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
