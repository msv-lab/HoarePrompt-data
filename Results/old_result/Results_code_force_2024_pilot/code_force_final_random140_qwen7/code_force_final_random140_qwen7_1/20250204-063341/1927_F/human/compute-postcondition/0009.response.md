Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` satisfy specific conditions, followed by `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `u`, `v`, and `w`. The function does not return any value explicitly but processes the input according to the given constraints.**
