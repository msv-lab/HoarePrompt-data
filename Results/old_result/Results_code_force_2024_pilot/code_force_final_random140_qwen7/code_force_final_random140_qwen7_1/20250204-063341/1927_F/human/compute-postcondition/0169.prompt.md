Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, and the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`. The variable `path` is an empty list, `curr` is set to `end`, and the final `node` equals `end`, indicating the loop would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. All nodes reachable from `start` are now in `prev`, with each node pointing to the node that was traversed to reach it. The `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed.
Code of the loop:
while curr != -1:
    path.append(curr)
    curr = prev[curr]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, the variable `curr` is updated to the predecessor of `end` in the shortest path tree, and the final `node` equals `end`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` is updated to the predecessor of `curr` in the shortest path tree, and `path` now includes the node `curr`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` is equal to `prev[curr]`, and `path` now includes the node `curr` with the updated value of `[node, prev[curr]]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
