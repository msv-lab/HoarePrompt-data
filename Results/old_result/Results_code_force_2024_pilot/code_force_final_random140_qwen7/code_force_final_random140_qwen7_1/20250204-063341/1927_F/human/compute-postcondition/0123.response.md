Output State: **`que` is now a deque that does not contain the node that was first in the original deque; `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`.**

Explanation: The code `node = que.popleft()` removes the leftmost (first) element from the deque `que` and assigns it to the variable `node`. After this operation, `que` no longer contains this element, but `node` holds its value.
