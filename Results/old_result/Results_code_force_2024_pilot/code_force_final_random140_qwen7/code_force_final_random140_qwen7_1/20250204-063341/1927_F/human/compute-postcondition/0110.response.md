Output State: **`que` is a deque with one less element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the value of `end` from the previous iteration, `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`, and `prev[nei]` equals `node`.**

This means that the variable `prev[nei]` has been updated to the current value of `node`, while all other conditions remain unchanged. The deque `que` has one less element, `node` is still the next neighbor of the current node in the graph, and `nei` remains the value of `end` from the previous iteration.
