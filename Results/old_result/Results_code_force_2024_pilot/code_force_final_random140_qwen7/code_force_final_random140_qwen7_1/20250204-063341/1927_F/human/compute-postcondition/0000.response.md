Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4 after calling `func_1()`.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the return value of the function `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since the initial state specifies that `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and no other details about the function `func_1()` are provided, we can only conclude that `test_cases` retains its property of being an integer within the specified range after the function call. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
