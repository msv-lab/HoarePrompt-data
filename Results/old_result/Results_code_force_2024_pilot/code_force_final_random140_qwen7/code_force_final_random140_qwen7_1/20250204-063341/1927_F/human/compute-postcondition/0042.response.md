Output State: **_min_edge is w, `parent_v` is updated to the root of `v` found by `dsu.find(v)`, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`, `start` is `u`, `end` is `v`**.

Explanation: The line `end = v` assigns the value of `v` to the variable `end`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `_min_edge`, `parent_v`, `parent_u`, and `start` remain as they were in the initial state.
