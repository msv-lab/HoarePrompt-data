Output State: **`graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `graph[node]`, `node`, and `nei` remain unchanged from their initial states.
