Output State: **`parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU object `dsu`, `w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, the union of `u` and `v` has been performed by `dsu.union(u, v)`**.

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v)` operation unites the sets containing `u` and `v`. This means that both `u` and `v` now belong to the same set in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. The roots of `u` and `v` are updated accordingly, but their specific new values are not provided directly by the code. The other variables (`parent_u`, `parent_v`, `w`, `u`, `v`) remain unchanged in terms of their values, but their context within the DSU changes due to the union operation.
