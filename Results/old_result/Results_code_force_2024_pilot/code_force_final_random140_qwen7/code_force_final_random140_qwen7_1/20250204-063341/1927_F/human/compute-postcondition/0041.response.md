Output State: **_min_edge is w, `parent_v` is updated to the root of `v` found by `dsu.find(v)`, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`, `start` is `u`**.

Explanation: The line `start = u` assigns the value of `u` to the variable `start`. The values of `_min_edge`, `parent_v`, `parent_u`, and `w` remain unchanged from their initial states.
