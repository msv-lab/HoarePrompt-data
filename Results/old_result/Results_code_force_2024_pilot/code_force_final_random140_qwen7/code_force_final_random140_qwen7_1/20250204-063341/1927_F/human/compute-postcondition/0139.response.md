Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `node` and `nei`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each neighbor (`nei`) of the current node (`node`). The loop continues as long as there are neighbors in `graph[node]`.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `graph[node]` has at least one element.
   - `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`.
   - `nei` is added to `que` as its last element.
   - If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `nei` in `graph[node]`, the loop will continue if `graph[node]` still has elements.
   - After processing the current `nei`, the next iteration will take the next neighbor from `graph[node]`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `node` remains the same because it is the starting point of the loop.
   - `nei` will change to the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.

6. **Post-iteration state**:
   - `graph[node]` should now have one less element (since one neighbor was processed).
   - `nei` will be the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`**.
