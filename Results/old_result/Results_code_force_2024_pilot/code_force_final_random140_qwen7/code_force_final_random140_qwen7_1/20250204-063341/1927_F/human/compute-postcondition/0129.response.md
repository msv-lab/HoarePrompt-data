Output State: **`graph[node]` has at least one element, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, the current value of `node` is equal to `start`, and the current value of `nei` is equal to `end`. We continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no specific action is performed within the loop body after the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the same conditions as the initial state, with the additional information that the loop continues.
