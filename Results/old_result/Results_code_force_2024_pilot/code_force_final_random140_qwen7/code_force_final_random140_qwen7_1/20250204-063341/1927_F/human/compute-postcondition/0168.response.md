Output State: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, `curr` is equal to the start node, and `path` is a list containing all nodes from `end` to `start` in reverse order, representing the shortest path in the graph.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `curr` has reached the start node since the loop continues until `curr` is no longer a predecessor in the `prev` dictionary (i.e., it reaches the root of the shortest path tree). The `path` list now contains the complete shortest path from the `end` node back to the `start` node, as each iteration appends the current node's predecessor to the path.
