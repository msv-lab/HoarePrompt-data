Output State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`, the variable `curr` is updated to the predecessor of `end` in the shortest path tree, and `path` now includes the node `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `path.append(curr)` appends the current node (`curr`) to the list `path`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
