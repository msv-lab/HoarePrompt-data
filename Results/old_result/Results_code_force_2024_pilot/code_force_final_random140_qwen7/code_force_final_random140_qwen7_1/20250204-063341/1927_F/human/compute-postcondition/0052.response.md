Postcondition: **`w` is the weight of the next edge, `u` is one endpoint of the next edge, `v` is the other endpoint of the next edge, `parent_u` is the root of the component containing `u`, `parent_v` is the root of the component containing `v`. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `start` is `u`, `_min_edge` is `w`, and `end` is `v`. Otherwise, the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed.**
