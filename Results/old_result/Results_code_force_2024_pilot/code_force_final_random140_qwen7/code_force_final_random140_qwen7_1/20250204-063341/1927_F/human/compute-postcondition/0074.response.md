The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the impact of the `continue` statement is not directly observable in terms of changing the values of the variables. The variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` added to it; `nei` is now the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.**
