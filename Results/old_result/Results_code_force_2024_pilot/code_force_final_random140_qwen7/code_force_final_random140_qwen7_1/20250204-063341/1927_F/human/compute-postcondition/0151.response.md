Postcondition: `graph[node]` has at least one element remaining, `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, and `prev[nei]` is either `node` or unchanged, `que` now contains the element `nei` appended to its end if `nei` was not previously in `prev`.
