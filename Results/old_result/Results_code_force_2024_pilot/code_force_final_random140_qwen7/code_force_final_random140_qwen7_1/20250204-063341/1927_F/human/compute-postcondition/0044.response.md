Postcondition: **`parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU object `dsu`, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU object `dsu`. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is `w`, `parent_v` is updated to the root of `v` found by `dsu.find(v)`, `start` is `u`, and `end` is `v`. Otherwise, the union of `u` and `v` has been performed by `dsu.union(u, v)` and `w` remains the weight of the next edge, `u` and `v` remain their respective endpoints.**
