Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `m-1`. At this point, `i` must still be less than `m`. The variable `u` and `v` will hold the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration, and `w` will be the weight of the last edge added. The `graph` dictionary will have updated adjacency lists such that for every pair `(u, v)` added through the loop, both `u` and `v` will have each other in their respective adjacency lists. The `edges` list will contain tuples `(w, u, v)` for each edge added during the loop, with the last tuple being `(w, u, v)` from the final iteration.

In summary, the graph will be fully constructed with all specified edges, and the `edges` list will contain all the edge details added during the loop execution.
