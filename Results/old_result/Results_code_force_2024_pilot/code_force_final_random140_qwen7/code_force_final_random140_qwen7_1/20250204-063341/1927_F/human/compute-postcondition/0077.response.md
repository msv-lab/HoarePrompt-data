Output State: **`node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `prev[nei]` is now assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` and `nei` added to it; `nei` is now the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `que.append(nei)` appends the value of `nei` to the list `que`. This means that `nei` is added to the existing elements in `que`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
