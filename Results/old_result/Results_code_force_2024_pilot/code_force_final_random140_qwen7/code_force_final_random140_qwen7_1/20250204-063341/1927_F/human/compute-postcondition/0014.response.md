Output State: **`i` is 2, `i` must be less than `m`, `u` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `v` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `w` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `graph[u]` now includes `v` and `graph[v]` now includes `u`, `edges` now includes `(w, u, v)` and the tuple `(w, u, v)` appended.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, w = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its three return values to `u`, `v`, and `w` respectively. The initial conditions for `i` and `m` remain unchanged, and the relationships between `u`, `v`, and `w` and the graph and edges are updated according to the function's return values.
