Postcondition: `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection. `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection. `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` added to it. If `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, we continue the loop or iteration.
