Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for nei in graph[node]:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `node` and `nei`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `graph[node]`. This means that `nei` will iterate over all keys in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary.
   - The value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection.
   - `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection.
   - `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`.
   - `que` contains `nei` added to it.
   - If `node` equals `start` and `nei` equals `end`, we continue the loop or iteration.

4. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the existence of `nei` in `graph[node]`, the next `nei` will be the next element in the collection associated with `node`.
   - The value of `node` remains the same because it is the starting point of the iteration.
   - The value of `nei` changes to the next element in the collection associated with `node`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `node` remains the same.
   - `nei` changes to the next element in the collection associated with `node`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `nei`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`node` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection. `nei` is a key in the `graph` dictionary, and the value associated with `nei` in the `graph` dictionary is a non-empty collection; `prev[nei]` is assigned the value of `node`; `que` contains `nei` added to it. `nei` is now the next element in the collection associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary.**
