Output State: **`que` is a deque with one more element than before, `node` is the next neighbor of the current `node` in the graph (i.e., `nei`), `nei` is the next neighbor being processed, and `prev[nei]` is updated to the current `node`.**

Explanation: The code `que.append(nei)` appends the variable `nei` to the deque `que`. This increases the number of elements in `que` by one. The other variables (`node`, `nei`, and `prev[nei]`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
