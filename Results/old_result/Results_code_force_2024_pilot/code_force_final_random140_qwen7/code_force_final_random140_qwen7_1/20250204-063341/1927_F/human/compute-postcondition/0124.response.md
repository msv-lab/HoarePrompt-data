Output State: **`que` is now a deque that does not contain the node that was first in the original deque; `node` is the element that was removed from the front of `que`. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `que` and `node` remain unchanged.
