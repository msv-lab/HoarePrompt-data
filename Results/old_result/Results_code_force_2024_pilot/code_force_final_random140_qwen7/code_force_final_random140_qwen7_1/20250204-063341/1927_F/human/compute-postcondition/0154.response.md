Output State: `que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, and the dictionary `prev` contains the shortest path from `start` to every node in the graph that was reachable. If the final `node` equals `end`, the loop would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added, and `parent_u` and `parent_v` are no longer relevant since the loop has completed. The `edges` list has been fully processed, and the `prev` dictionary now contains the shortest path information for all reachable nodes from `start`.
