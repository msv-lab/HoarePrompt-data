Output State: **`que` is an empty deque, `node` is the last node processed before `que` became empty, and the dictionary `prev` contains the predecessors of all nodes that were processed in the graph, forming the shortest path tree rooted at `start`. The variable `path` is an empty list, and the final `node` equals `end`, indicating the loop would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. All nodes reachable from `start` are now in `prev`, with each node pointing to the node that was traversed to reach it. The `graph` dictionary reflects the final adjacency list structure of the graph after all edges have been added and union operations have been performed.**

The code initializes the variable `path` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `que`, `node`, `prev`, `start`, `end`, or `graph`. The conditions described in the initial state remain unchanged except for the addition of `path` being an empty list.
