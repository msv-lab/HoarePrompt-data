Output State: **`i` is 3, `ones[3]` is `ones[2]` + (1 if `nums[2]` == 1 else 0)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ones[i]` based on the value of `ones[i - 1]` and the condition `nums[i - 1] == 1`. Since `i` is 3, the code calculates `ones[3]` as `ones[2]` plus 1 if `nums[2]` is 1, or 0 otherwise. The initial value of `i` remains 3, and the value of `ones[3]` depends on the value of `nums[2]`.
