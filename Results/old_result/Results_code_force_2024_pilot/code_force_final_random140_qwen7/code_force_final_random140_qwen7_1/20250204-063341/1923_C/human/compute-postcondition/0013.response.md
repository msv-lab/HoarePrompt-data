Output State: `i` is `n`; `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `ones[n]` is the count of `1`s in `nums`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `sum[n]` will hold the total sum of all integers in the `nums` list. The `ones[n]` will store the count of how many times the integer `1` appears in the `nums` list.
