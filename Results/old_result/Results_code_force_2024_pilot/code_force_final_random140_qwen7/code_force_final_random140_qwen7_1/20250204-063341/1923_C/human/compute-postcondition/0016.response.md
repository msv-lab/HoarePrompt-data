Output State: **`i` is `q`; `l` is an input integer; `r` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split(' '))` and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The initial value of `i` is `q`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `l` and `r` as input integers, while `i` retains its initial value `q`.
