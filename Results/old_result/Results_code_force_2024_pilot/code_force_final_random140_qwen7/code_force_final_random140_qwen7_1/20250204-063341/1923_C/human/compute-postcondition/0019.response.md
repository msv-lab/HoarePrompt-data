Output State: **`i` is `q`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `l`, `r`, and the condition `l == r` remains unchanged, the output state includes these variables in their original form, indicating that we continue the loop.
