Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `sum[2]` is `sum[1]` + `nums[1]` + `nums[1]`.
   - `ones[2]` is `ones[1]` + (1 if `nums[1]` == 1 else 0) + (1 if `nums[1]` == 1 else 0).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Calculate the New Values**:
   - `sum[3]` will be `sum[2]` + `nums[2]` + `nums[2]`.
   - `ones[3]` will be `ones[2]` + (1 if `nums[2]` == 1 else 0) + (1 if `nums[2]` == 1 else 0).

However, since we are only adjusting the states at the start of the next iteration based on the loop head, we don't need to calculate the new values for `sum[3]` and `ones[3]`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**.
