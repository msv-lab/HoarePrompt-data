Postcondition: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 2`, `l` and `r` are integers entered by the user, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
