Output State: **`i` is 2, `sum[2]` is `sum[1]` + `nums[1]`, `ones[2]` is `ones[1]` + (1 if `nums[1]` == 1 else 0), `ones[2]` is updated to `ones[1]` + (1 if `nums[1]` == 1 else 0)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ones[2]` to be equal to `ones[1]` plus 1 if `nums[1]` is equal to 1, otherwise 0. Since the initial state already specifies the relationship between `ones[2]` and `ones[1]`, and `nums[1]`, the only change is in the value of `ones[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
