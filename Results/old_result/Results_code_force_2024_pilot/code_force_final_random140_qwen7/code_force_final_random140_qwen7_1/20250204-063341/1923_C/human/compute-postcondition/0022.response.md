Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `sumInRange` as the difference between `sum[r]` and `sum[l - 1]`. The values of `onesInRange`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
