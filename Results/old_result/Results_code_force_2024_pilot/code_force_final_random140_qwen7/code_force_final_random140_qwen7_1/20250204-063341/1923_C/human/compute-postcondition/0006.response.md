Output State: **`i` is 1; `sum[1]` is `sum[0]` + `nums[0]`; `ones[1]` is `ones[0]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum[1]` to be the sum of `sum[0]` and `nums[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `ones[1]` is unchanged from its initial state, which is `ones[0]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0).
