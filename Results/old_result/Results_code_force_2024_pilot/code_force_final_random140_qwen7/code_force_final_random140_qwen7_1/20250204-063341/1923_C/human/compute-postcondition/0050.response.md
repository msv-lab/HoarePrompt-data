Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t`, a list of integers `c` of length `n`, and `q` queries. For each query, it takes two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function returns the results of processing these queries based on the specified conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, a list of `n` positive integers `c`, and `q` queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function processes each query to determine some result based on the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i`, and returns the aggregated results of all queries.
