You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Program:
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it checks whether a specific condition is met based on the count of 1s and the sum of elements within a specified range of the list. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes two arrays `ones` and `sum` to store the cumulative counts and sums, respectively.
   - This initialization helps in calculating the number of 1s and the sum within any range efficiently using prefix sums.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - `ones[i]` stores the count of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum (`sumInRange`) within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - The condition for a subarray to be "good" is checked using the formula:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - Simplifying the condition:
     \[
     \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \le \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - If the condition holds, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition \( \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \le \text{sumInRange} \) is correct for determining if a subarray can be transformed into another array `b` satisfying the given conditions.
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray can be split into two parts: the sum of the 1s and the sum of the non-1s, with the non-1s being strictly greater than 0.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `l == r` by printing "NO", which is correct since a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the conditions.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of prefix sums allows efficient computation of the required values for each query, making the solution scalable for large inputs.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
