Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 2`, `l` and `r` are integers entered by the user, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `onesInRange` to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `l`, `r`, or `sumInRange`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
