Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `i` is set to `q`.
- `l` and `r` are input integers.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- The condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange)` is satisfied.

The `print` statement simply outputs `'YES'`.

Since the condition is satisfied, the print statement will execute without any further computation needed.

Output: **YES**
