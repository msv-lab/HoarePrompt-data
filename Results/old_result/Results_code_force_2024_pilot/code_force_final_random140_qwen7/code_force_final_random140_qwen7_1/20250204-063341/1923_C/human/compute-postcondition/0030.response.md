Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `i` is `q - 1`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, the values of `l` and `r` are updated to integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. Since the initial values of `l` and `r` are described as "input integers," their values are now explicitly set to the integers entered by the user. All other variables (`onesInRange`, `i`, `sumInRange`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
