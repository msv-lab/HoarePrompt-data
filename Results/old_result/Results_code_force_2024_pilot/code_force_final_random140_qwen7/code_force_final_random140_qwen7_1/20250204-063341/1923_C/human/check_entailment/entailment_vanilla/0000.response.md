### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` such that:
     - The sum of elements in both arrays is equal.
     - No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For a subarray to be "good", it must contain at least one `1` because otherwise, it's impossible to create a corresponding `b` where all elements are positive and different from `a`.
   - If the subarray has more than one `1`, we can always construct a valid `b` by swapping some `1`s with other numbers while ensuring the sums remain equal and no elements are the same.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code uses prefix sums (`ones` and `sum`) to efficiently count the number of `1`s and calculate the sum of elements within any subarray.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray contains at least one `1` and if the number of `1`s plus the remaining elements allows for a valid transformation into `b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where `l == r` by immediately printing "NO".
   - It correctly calculates the number of `1`s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` ensures that there are enough elements to form a valid `b`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic is sound and correctly implements the conditions for determining if a subarray is "good".
   - The implementation efficiently processes each query using prefix sums, which is optimal given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly determines whether a subarray is "good" based on the provided conditions.

**Correctness: True**
