Postcondition: **`r` is updated to either `r + 1` or `r + rn`, `c` is increased by `ans` if `ans >= y`, otherwise `c` remains unchanged, `ans` and `rn` are updated to the values returned by `dfs(node, y)`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, and `node` is updated to the next element in `g[x]`.**
