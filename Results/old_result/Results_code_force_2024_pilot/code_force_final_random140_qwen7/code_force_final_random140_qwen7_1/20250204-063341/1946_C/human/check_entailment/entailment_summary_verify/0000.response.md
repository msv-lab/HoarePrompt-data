### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required functionality.

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`.
   - The upper bound `r` should indeed be `n` because the size of each connected component can be at most \( n \).
   - The original assessment correctly points out this issue.

2. **Check Function Logic**:
   - The `check` function uses a DFS to determine if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The `dfs` function in `check` returns the size of the largest connected component and the total number of nodes in that component.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not account for the exact number of edges to be removed and the distribution of components.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies this flaw.

3. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function counts the size of the largest connected component and the total nodes in that component.
   - It does not correctly handle the removal of edges and the counting of connected components.
   - The original assessment correctly points out this issue.

Given these observations, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality. The binary search bounds are incorrect, and the `dfs` function does not properly handle the edge removal and component size checks.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The provided code is incorrect based on the analysis of the binary search bounds and the logic within the `dfs` and `check` functions.
