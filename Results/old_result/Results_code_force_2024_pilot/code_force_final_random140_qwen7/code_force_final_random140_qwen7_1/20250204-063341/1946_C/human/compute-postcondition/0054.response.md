Output State: The stack contains tuples of the form `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `tree.vertices[v]`. Specifically, `stack` will contain every child of `tree.vertices[v]` exactly once, with each child paired with `False`.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `stack` will include a tuple for each child of the vertex `v` in the `tree`. Each tuple in the stack will have the child vertex as the first element and `False` as the second element. This means that the stack will be fully populated with all the children of `v`, and no additional elements will be present.
