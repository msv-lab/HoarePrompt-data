Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` contains at least one element, `u` is the first element of `tree.vertices[v].children`, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it.**

This means that the first element `u` from `tree.vertices[v].children` is added to the `stack` along with a boolean value `False`. The rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
