Output State: **The program returns the tuple (good_components[s], remaining_size[s]), where `good_components[s]` is the total count of good components including the initial vertex 's' and all its descendants, and `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of sizes of all children of 's' that have a size greater than or equal to `x`, or the sum of sizes of all children of 's' if no child meets the size condition.**

This output state describes the final values of `good_components[s]` and `remaining_size[s]` after processing all nodes in the tree, as per the given initial conditions and the logic of the code snippet provided.
