Output State: **`good_components[v]' is increased by `good_components[u]', `remaining_size[v]' is updated to be `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]', and `postorder' is updated with the value of `v'; `remaining_size[v]' is now the sum of its original value and `remaining_size[u]'.**

This means that the value of `remaining_size[v]' has been updated to include the value of `remaining_size[u]' added to its original value. All other conditions remain unchanged.
