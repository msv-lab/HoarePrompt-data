Output State: **`postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is a child of `tree.vertices[v]` except the last element which is now `(v, True)`, and the stack has appended `(v, True)` as a new element.**

This means that the `stack` now includes the tuple `(v, True)` as its last element, while all other elements remain unchanged. The `postorder` list remains the same as it was in the initial state.
