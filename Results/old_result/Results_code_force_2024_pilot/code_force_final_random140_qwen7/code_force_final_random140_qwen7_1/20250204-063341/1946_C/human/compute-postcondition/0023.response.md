Postcondition: `r` is updated to either `r + 1` or `r + rn`, `c` is updated to `c + ans` if `ans >= y`, otherwise `c` remains unchanged, `ans` and `rn` remain unchanged, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, and `node` is updated to the next element in `g[x]`. If `node` is not in `visited`, then `r` is updated to either `r + 1` or `r + rn`, and `c` is updated to `c + ans` if `ans >= y`, otherwise `c` remains unchanged.
