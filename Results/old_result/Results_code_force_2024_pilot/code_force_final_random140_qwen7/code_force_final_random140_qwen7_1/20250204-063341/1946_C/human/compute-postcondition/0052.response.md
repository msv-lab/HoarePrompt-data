Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` contains at least one element, `u` is the next element of `tree.vertices[v].children`, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it, and the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to `stack`.**

This means that the tuple `(u, False)` was already in the stack before the code was executed, and now it has been appended again, making the stack contain two instances of the same tuple.
