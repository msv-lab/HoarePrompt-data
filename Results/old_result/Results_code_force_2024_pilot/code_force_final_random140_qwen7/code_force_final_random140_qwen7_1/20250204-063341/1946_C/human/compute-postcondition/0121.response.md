Postcondition: **`postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` is either non-empty containing tuples of the form `(u, False)` representing unprocessed child nodes of `v`, or it is empty indicating all children of `v` have been processed. `good_components[v]` reflects the total count of good components including `v` itself and its descendants, and `remaining_size[v]` holds the accumulated sizes of all children of `v`.**
