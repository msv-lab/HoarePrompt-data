Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided functions collectively solve the problem as described. Let's break down the problem and the functions step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a tree with \( n \) vertices and need to remove \( k \) edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).
   - The goal is to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies this condition.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree and performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \). The binary search is performed between 1 and \( n / k + 1 \). For each midpoint \( mid \), it calls `check(mid)` to verify if it's possible to achieve the desired condition with \( mid \) as the minimum size of each component.
   - **dfs**: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the sizes of connected components and the number of components that meet the size requirement \( y \).
   - **check**: This function uses DFS to verify if it's possible to have all connected components of size at least \( x \) after removing \( k \) edges. It returns `True` if the condition is met and `False` otherwise.

3. **Binary Search and DFS**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` is used to efficiently find the maximum \( x \) by narrowing down the range using the `check` function.
   - The `dfs` function correctly calculates the sizes of connected components and the number of components that meet the size requirement.
   - The `check` function correctly uses DFS to validate the condition for a given \( x \).

Given that:
- The binary search in `func_1` correctly narrows down the range for \( x \).
- The `dfs` function correctly calculates the sizes of connected components and verifies the condition.
- The `check` function correctly uses DFS to validate the condition for a given \( x \).

The provided functions collectively solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
