Output State: **`postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)`, `good_components[v]` is 0, `remaining_size[v]` is 1, `stack` now contains an additional tuple `(u, False)`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `stack.append((u, False))` appends a new tuple `(u, False)` to the `stack`. This operation does not affect the values of `postorder`, `good_components[v]`, or `remaining_size[v]`. It only adds a new element to the `stack`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new tuple in the stack.
