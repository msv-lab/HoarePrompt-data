Postcondition: **All children of `tree.vertices[v]` have been processed, `stack` is empty, `good_components[v]` reflects the total count of good components including `v` itself and its descendants, considering the condition based on `remaining_size[u]`. The `remaining_size[v]` holds the accumulated sizes of all children of `v`. The `postorder` contains the traversal order of all vertices.**
