Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `tree`, which is an instance of a tree structure class; `s`, an integer representing the starting vertex; and `x`, an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. It returns a tuple containing two elements: `good_components[s]`, which is the total count of good components including the initial vertex 's' and all its descendants, and `remaining_size[s]`, which is the sum of sizes of all children of 's' that have a size greater than or equal to `x`, or the sum of sizes of all children of 's' if no child meets the size condition.**
