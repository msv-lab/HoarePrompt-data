Output State: **`postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is a child of `tree.vertices[v]` except the last element which is now `(v, True), postorder` is updated with the value of `v`.**

Explanation: The code pops an element from the `stack`, updating both `v` and `postorder`. The popped element is expected to be of the form `(u, False)`, indicating a child vertex `u` of `tree.vertices[v]` that hasn't been processed yet. After popping, the last element in the `stack` is updated to `(v, True)`, marking that `v` has been processed. The `postorder` list is updated to include the current vertex `v`.
