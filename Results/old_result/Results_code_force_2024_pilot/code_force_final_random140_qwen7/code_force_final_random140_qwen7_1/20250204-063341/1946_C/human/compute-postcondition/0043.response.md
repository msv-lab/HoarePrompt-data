Output State: **`stack` is now an empty list, `v` is the first element of the last tuple in the original stack, and `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in the original stack.**

Explanation: The code `v, postorder = stack.pop()` pops the last tuple from the `stack` and assigns the first element of the tuple to `v` and the second element to `postorder`. After popping, the `stack` becomes empty.
