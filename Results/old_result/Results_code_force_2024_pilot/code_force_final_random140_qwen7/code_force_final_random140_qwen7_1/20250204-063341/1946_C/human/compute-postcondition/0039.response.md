Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of a tree. It then constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree. Next, it performs a binary search to find a specific value `r`, which is printed as the output. The function does not return any value.**
