Output State: **`r` is updated to `r + rn`, `c` remains unchanged, `ans` and `rn` remain unchanged, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, and `node` is updated to the next element in `g[x]`.**

Explanation: The code `r += rn` updates the value of `r` by adding `rn` to its current value. The other variables (`c`, `ans`, `rn`, `g[x]`, and `node`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for `r`, which is now `r + rn`.
