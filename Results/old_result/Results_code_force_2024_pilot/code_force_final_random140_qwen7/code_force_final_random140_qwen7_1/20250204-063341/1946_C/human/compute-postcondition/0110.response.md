Postcondition: `good_components[v]' is increased by either 1 or `good_components[u]', `remaining_size[v]' is updated to be `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]', and `postorder' is updated with the value of `v'. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]' is specifically increased by 1.
