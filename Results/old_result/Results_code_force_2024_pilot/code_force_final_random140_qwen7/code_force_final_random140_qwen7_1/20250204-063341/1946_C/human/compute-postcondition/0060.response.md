Output State: **`good_components[v]` is increased by 2; `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += 1` increases the value of `good_components[v]` by 1. Since `good_components[v]` was initially increased by `good_components[u]`, and now it is increased by another 1, the total increase is by 2. The condition `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x` remains unchanged.
