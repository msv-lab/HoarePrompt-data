Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` is a list containing one tuple `(s, False)`, `good_components` is an empty dictionary, `remaining_size` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        good_components[v] = 0
        remaining_size[v] = 1
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    elif postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            good_components[v] += good_components[u]
            if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                good_components[v] += 1
            else:
                remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stack` is either a list containing alternating elements of vertices from `tree.vertices['s'].children` starting with `'s'` and ending with the deepest vertex, or an empty list. `v` is either the last vertex added to the `stack` which is the deepest vertex in the children hierarchy, or 's'. `postorder` is either False or True. `good_components['s']` is the total count of good components from all children of 's', and `remaining_size['s']` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of 's' where `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`; if no such children exist, `remaining_size['s']` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of 's'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: If `postorder` is an empty value, `stack` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `stack` contains tuples of the form `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `tree.vertices[v]`, and for each node `v` in the tree, `good_components[v]` is increased by the sum of `good_components[u]` for each child `u` of `v`. Additionally, if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x` for any child `u`, then `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` for those children.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` is either non-empty containing tuples of the form `(u, False)` representing unprocessed child nodes of `v`, or it is empty indicating all children of `v` have been processed. `good_components[v]` reflects the total count of good components including `v` itself and its descendants, and `remaining_size[v]` holds the accumulated sizes of all children of `v`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
