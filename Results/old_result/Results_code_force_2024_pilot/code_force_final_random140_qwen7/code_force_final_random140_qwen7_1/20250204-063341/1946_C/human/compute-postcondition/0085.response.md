Output State: **`postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is a child of `tree.vertices[v]` except the last element which is now `(v, True)`, and the stack has appended `(v, True)` as a new element; `good_components[v]` is 0.**

The code `good_components[v] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `good_components[v]`. This does not affect the values of `postorder` or the contents of the `stack`. Therefore, the `postorder` remains unchanged, and the `stack` retains its previous state with the addition of the tuple `(v, True)`.
