Postcondition: `good_components[v]` is increased by either 2 (if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`) or by `good_components[u]` (if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`). Additionally, if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, then `remaining_size[v]` is set to `remaining_size[u]` and `good_components[u]` remains unchanged.
