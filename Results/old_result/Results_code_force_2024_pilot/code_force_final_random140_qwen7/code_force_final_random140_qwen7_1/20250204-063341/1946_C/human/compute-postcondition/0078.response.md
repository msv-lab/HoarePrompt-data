Output State: **`good_components[v]` is increased by the sum of `good_components[u]` for each child `u` of `v` in the tree. If `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x` for any child `u`, then `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` for those children.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `good_components[v]` will hold the total count of good components from all children of vertex `v`, plus one additional count for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.
