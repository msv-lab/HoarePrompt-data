The function `check` accepts an integer `x` and returns a boolean value. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from vertex 1 to determine if all connected components in the graph have at least `x` vertices. If the DFS confirms this condition and the number of edges removed (`r`) meets a certain threshold (`k`), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
