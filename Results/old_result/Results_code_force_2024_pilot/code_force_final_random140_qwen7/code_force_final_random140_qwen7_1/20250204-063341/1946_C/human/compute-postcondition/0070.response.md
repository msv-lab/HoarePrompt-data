Postcondition: `good_components[v]' is increased by either 1 (if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`) or `good_components[u]' + 1 (if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`). `good_components[u]' remains unchanged, and `remaining_size[u]' remains unchanged in both cases. Additionally, if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `remaining_size[v]' is increased by `remaining_size[u]'`.
