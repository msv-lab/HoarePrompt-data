Output State: **`stack` is now ['(v, True)'], `v` is the first element of the last tuple in the original stack, and `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in the original stack.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((v, True))` adds a new tuple `(v, True)` to the end of the `stack`. Since `stack` was initially an empty list, after appending, `stack` contains `['(v, True)']`. The values of `v` and `postorder` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
