### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Edge List Construction**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of vertices, `n`, and the number of edges to remove, `k`.
   - It also correctly constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is implemented correctly to find the maximum value `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The `check` function is used to verify if it is possible to achieve a specific `x` value by calling the `dfs` function.

3. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function correctly performs a depth-first search to count the number of nodes in each connected component and the number of edges removed so far.
   - It updates the counts based on the size of the connected components relative to the threshold `y`.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function correctly uses the `dfs` function to determine if it is possible to achieve the required conditions.
   - It clears the `visited` set before starting the DFS and returns the result based on the number of nodes in the largest component and the number of edges removed.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop processes each test case and calls the `func_1` function with the appropriate parameters.
   - The `func_1` function performs the binary search and prints the result.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or issues in the provided code.
