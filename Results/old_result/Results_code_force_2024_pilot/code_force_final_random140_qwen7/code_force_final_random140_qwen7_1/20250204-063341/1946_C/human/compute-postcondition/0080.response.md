Postcondition: **`stack` remains an empty list. If `postorder` is not an empty value, then for each node `v` in the tree, `good_components[v]` is increased by the sum of `good_components[u]` for each child `u` of `v`. Additionally, if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x` for any child `u`, then `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` for those children.**
