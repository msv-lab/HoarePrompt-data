Postcondition: `stack` is an empty list, `v` is the first element of the last tuple in the updated stack, and `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in the updated stack. If `postorder` is not an empty value, then `good_components[v]` is increased by the sum of `good_components[u]` for each child `u` of `v` in the tree. Additionally, if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x` for any child `u`, then `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` for those children.
