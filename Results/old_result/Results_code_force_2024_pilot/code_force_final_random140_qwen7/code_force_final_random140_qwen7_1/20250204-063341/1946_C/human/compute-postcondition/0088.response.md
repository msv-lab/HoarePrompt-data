Output State: **`postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` and a new element `(u, False)` is appended, `good_components[v]` is 0, `remaining_size[v]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends a new tuple `(u, False)` to the `stack`. Since `u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v]`, the new tuple is specifically `(u, False)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
