You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge in the tree, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):

    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)

    #State: All elements in `edges` have been processed, and for each edge (a, b), both `g[a]` and `g[b]` include `b` and `a`.

    #State: Output State: `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `mid` is the last value calculated before the loop exits.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the while condition `l <= r` will no longer be true because `l` will eventually become greater than `r`. At this point, the loop terminates. The variable `c` remains 0 and `visited` remains an empty set as they are not modified within the loop. The value of `mid` will be the last calculated value before the loop exits, which is determined by the latest values of `l` and `r`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of a tree. It then constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree. Next, it performs a binary search to find a specific value `r`, which is printed as the output. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, y is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. g is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and visited is a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal.

    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two elements: 'c', which is the sum of all 'ans' values when 'ans' was less than 'y', and 'r', which is the sum of all 'rn' values plus the number of times 'ans' was greater than or equal to 'y'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. `x` represents a vertex in the tree, and `y` represents the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from vertex `x`. It calculates and returns a tuple containing two elements: `c`, which is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`, and `r`, which is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer, visited is a set initialized to be empty, and dfs is a function that takes the current vertex, the size threshold x, and returns a tuple (bool, int) where the bool indicates whether all connected components have at least x vertices and the int represents the number of edges removed so far.

    visited.clear()

    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: `visited` is a set containing 1, `ans` is a boolean value, `r` is an integer value. `ans` is less than `x` or `r` is less than `k`
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` accepts an integer `x` and returns a boolean value. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from vertex 1 to determine if all connected components in the graph have at least `x` vertices. If the DFS confirms this condition and the number of edges removed (`r`) meets a certain threshold (`k`), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

Here's why the code is incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. However, the upper bound `r` should be `n` because the size of each connected component can be at most \( n \). This means the search space should be from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Check Function Logic**: The `check` function is supposed to verify if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices. However, the current implementation of `dfs` in `check` does not correctly count the number of connected components and their sizes after removing edges. Specifically, the `dfs` function returns the size of the largest connected component and the total number of nodes in that component, which does not help in verifying the condition for \( k \) edges removal.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function does not correctly handle the removal of edges and the counting of connected components. It only counts the size of the largest connected component and the total nodes in that component, which is not sufficient to determine if exactly \( k \) edges can be removed to meet the requirement.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
