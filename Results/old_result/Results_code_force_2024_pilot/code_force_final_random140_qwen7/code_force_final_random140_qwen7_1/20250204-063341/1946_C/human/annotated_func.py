#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge in the tree, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: All elements in `edges` have been processed, and for each edge (a, b), both `g[a]` and `g[b]` include `b` and `a`.

    l = 1

    #State: Output State: `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `mid` is the last value calculated before the loop exits.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the while condition `l <= r` will no longer be true because `l` will eventually become greater than `r`. At this point, the loop terminates. The variable `c` remains 0 and `visited` remains an empty set as they are not modified within the loop. The value of `mid` will be the last calculated value before the loop exits, which is determined by the latest values of `l` and `r`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of a tree. It then constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree. Next, it performs a binary search to find a specific value `r`, which is printed as the output. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, y is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. g is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and visited is a set of visited vertices during the DFS traversal.

            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: `r` is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`, and `c` is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two elements: 'c', which is the sum of all 'ans' values when 'ans' was less than 'y', and 'r', which is the sum of all 'rn' values plus the number of times 'ans' was greater than or equal to 'y'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. `x` represents a vertex in the tree, and `y` represents the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from vertex `x`. It calculates and returns a tuple containing two elements: `c`, which is the sum of all `ans` values when `ans` was less than `y`, and `r`, which is the sum of all `rn` values plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer, visited is a set initialized to be empty, and dfs is a function that takes the current vertex, the size threshold x, and returns a tuple (bool, int) where the bool indicates whether all connected components have at least x vertices and the int represents the number of edges removed so far.
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: `visited` is a set containing 1, `ans` is a boolean value, `r` is an integer value. `ans` is less than `x` or `r` is less than `k`
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` accepts an integer `x` and returns a boolean value. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from vertex 1 to determine if all connected components in the graph have at least `x` vertices. If the DFS confirms this condition and the number of edges removed (`r`) meets a certain threshold (`k`), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
