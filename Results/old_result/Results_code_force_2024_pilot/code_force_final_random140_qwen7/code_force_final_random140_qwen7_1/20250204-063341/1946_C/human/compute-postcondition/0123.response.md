Output State: `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True` for the initial vertex 's'. For every vertex `v` in the tree, `good_components[v]` contains the total count of good components including `v` and all its descendants. `remaining_size[v]` contains the sum of sizes of all children of `v` whose size is greater than or equal to `x`, or the sum of sizes of all children of `v` if no child meets the size condition.

This means that after the loop has executed all iterations, the stack is empty because all nodes have been processed. The `postorder` flag for the initial vertex 's' is set to `True`, indicating that the processing for 's' is complete. Each vertex `v` in the tree has its `good_components[v]` updated to reflect the total count of good components from `v` and all its descendants. Similarly, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to include the sizes of all children of `v` that meet the specified size condition.
