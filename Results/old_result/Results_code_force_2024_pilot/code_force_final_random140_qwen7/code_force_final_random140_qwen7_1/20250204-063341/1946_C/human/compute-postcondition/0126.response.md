Functionality: **The function accepts a tree structure (`tree`), a starting vertex (`s`), and a minimum size threshold (`x`). It processes the tree to determine the total count of good components including the starting vertex and all its descendants, and the sum of sizes of all children of the starting vertex that meet or exceed the size threshold. The function returns these two values as a tuple.**
