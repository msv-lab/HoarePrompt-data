Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - This part is correct and works as expected.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`.
   - The goal is to find the maximum value `x` such that the tree can be split into connected components of size at least `x` after removing `k` edges.
   - The binary search logic is correct. It narrows down the possible values of `x` using the `check` function.

3. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search to count the number of nodes and the number of connected components of a certain size.
   - The function `dfs` is designed to return a tuple `(c, r)` where `c` is the number of nodes in the current subtree and `r` is the number of connected components in the current subtree.
   - The function correctly updates the `visited` set to avoid revisiting nodes.
   - However, there is an issue with the logic inside the loop. The variable `r` should only be incremented when the size of the current subtree is at least `y`. The current implementation increments `r` for every node, which is incorrect.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to verify if it is possible to split the tree into connected components of size at least `x` after removing `k` edges.
   - The logic in `check` is correct but relies on the `dfs` function, which has the issue mentioned above.

### Corrected DFS Function

To fix the issue, the `dfs` function should be modified as follows:

```python
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            (ans, rn) = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
    if c >= y:
        r += 1
    return (c, r)
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a logical error in the `dfs` function. After correcting this error, the program should work as intended.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
