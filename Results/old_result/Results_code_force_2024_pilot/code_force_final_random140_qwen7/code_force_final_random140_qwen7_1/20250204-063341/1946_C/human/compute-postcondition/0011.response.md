Output State: **`c` is `c` plus `ans`, `r` is `r` plus `rn`, `ans` is the result of the dfs function call with `node` and `y` as arguments, `rn` is the result of the dfs function call with `node` and `y` as arguments, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` is less than `y`**.

In natural language, this means that the variable `c` has been incremented by the value of `ans`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
