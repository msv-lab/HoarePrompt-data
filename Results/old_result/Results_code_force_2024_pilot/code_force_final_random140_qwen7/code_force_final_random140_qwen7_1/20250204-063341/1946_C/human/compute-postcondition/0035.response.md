Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x` and `y`. `x` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, and `y` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function returns a tuple containing two elements: 'c', which is the sum of all 'ans' values when 'ans' was less than 'y', and 'r', which is the sum of all 'rn' values plus the number of times 'ans' was greater than or equal to 'y'.**
