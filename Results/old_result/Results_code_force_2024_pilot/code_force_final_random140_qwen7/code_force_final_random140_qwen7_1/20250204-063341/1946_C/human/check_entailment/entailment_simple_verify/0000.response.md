### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Binary Search Initialization:
The binary search is indeed initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. While this initialization might seem reasonable, the key issue lies in the `check` function, which uses this binary search result incorrectly.

#### Check Function Logic:
The `check` function is designed to verify if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. However, the current implementation of the `dfs` function in `check` does not correctly count the number of connected components and their sizes after removing edges. The `dfs` function returns the size of the largest connected component and the total number of nodes in that component, which is not sufficient to determine if exactly `k` edges can be removed to meet the requirement.

#### DFS Function:
The `dfs` function does not correctly handle the removal of edges and the counting of connected components. It only counts the size of the largest connected component and the total nodes in that component. This approach is insufficient because it does not account for the specific requirement of removing exactly `k` edges to ensure each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality. The binary search is misused, and the `dfs` function does not accurately count the necessary information to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
