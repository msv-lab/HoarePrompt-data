Postcondition: `r` is the result of the program, `ans` is the result of the dfs function call with `node` and `y` as arguments, `rn` is the result of the dfs function call with `node` and `y` as arguments, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is not in `visited`. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `r` is increased by `rn` plus 1. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ans` and `r` remains unchanged.
