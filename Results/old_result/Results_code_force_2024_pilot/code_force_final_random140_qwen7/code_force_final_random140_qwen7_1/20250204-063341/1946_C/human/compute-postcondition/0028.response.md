Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`, `c` remains unchanged, `ans` and `rn` are updated to the values returned by `dfs(node, y)`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, and `node` is updated to the next element in `g[x]`.**

Explanation: The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The other variables (`c`, `ans`, `rn`, `node`, and `g[x]`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `g[x]` must contain at least one element and that `node` is updated to the next element in `g[x]` is preserved. The values of `ans` and `rn` are updated to the values returned by the function call `dfs(node, y)`.
