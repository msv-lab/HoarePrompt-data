Output State: **`good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`**.

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`. The conditions that `v` is the first element of the last tuple in the original stack, `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in the original stack and is true, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element remain unchanged.
