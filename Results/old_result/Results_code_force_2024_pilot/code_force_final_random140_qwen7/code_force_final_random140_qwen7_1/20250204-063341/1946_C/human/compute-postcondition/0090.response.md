Output State: **`postorder` is not an empty value, `stack` contains at least one tuple of the form `(u, False)` and a new element `(u, False)` is appended, `good_components[v]` is 0, `remaining_size[v]` is 1, `stack` now contains an additional tuple `(u, False)`**.

This means that the stack has an extra tuple `(u, False)` appended to it, while all other variables retain their previous values.
