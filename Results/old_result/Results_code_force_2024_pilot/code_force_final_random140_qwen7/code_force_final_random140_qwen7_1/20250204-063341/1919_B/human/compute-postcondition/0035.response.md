Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for q in e:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `e`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**: From the postcondition given, we know that at the end of the previous iteration:
   - `q` is a string.
   - If `q` is equal to `'+',` then `P` is 1. Otherwise, `q` is not equal to `'+',` and `M` is 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `q` must be a string (which it already is based on the postcondition).
   - The value of `q` determines the values of `P` and `M`.
   - If `q` is `'+',` then `P` should be 1, and `M` should be 0.
   - If `q` is not `'+',` then `M` should be 1, and `P` should be 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `q` is a string, it remains a string in the next iteration.
   - The value of `q` will determine the new values of `P` and `M`.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `q` is a string.
- If `q` was `'+',` then `P` is 1, otherwise `M` is 1.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `q` from the previous iteration, we can only state the general condition for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `q` is a string, P is 0 or M is 1 depending on the value of `q`**.

To be more specific, if `q` was `'+',` then `P` is 1, otherwise `M` is 1. But since we don't know the exact value of `q`, we can generalize it as:

**State: `q` is a string, P is 0 or M is 1**.
