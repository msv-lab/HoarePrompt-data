Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(abs(P - M))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the total number of '+' characters encountered in the string `e`, and `M` is the total number of '-' characters encountered in the string `e`.

This final state occurs because after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the string `e` will be fully processed, meaning it will become an empty string. The variables `P` and `M` will hold the counts of '+' and '-' characters, respectively, from the original string `e`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `q` will be the last character in the string `e`, `P` will be the total count of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` will be the total count of '-' characters in `e`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `M` will be equal to the number of characters in the string `e` that are not '+', and `P` will be equal to the number of '+' characters in the string `e`. The variable `q` will be the last character in the string `e`, and `i` and `s` will retain their initial values since they are not affected by the loop.

This means that if `e` is the entire string processed by the loop, `M` and `P` together account for all characters in `e`, with `M` representing the count of '-' characters (or any character other than '+') and `P` representing the count of '+' characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
