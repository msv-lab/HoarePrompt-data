Output: **abs(P - M) (where P is the count of '+' characters and M is the count of '-' characters in the original string e)**

Explanation:
- Initially, `e` is a non-empty string containing '+' and '-' characters.
- As the string `e` is processed, `P` keeps track of the number of '+' characters encountered.
- Similarly, `M` keeps track of the number of '-' characters encountered.
- After processing the entire string `e`, `e` becomes an empty string.
- The expression `abs(P - M)` calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the original string `e`.
- Therefore, the print statement outputs this absolute difference.
