Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty input string (with the first character removed), and `q` is the next character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.
