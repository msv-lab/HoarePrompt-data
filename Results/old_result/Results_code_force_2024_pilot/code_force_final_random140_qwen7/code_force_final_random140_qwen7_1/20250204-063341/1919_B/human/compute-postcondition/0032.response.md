Output State: **`q` is a string, and `q` is not equal to '+', `M` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `M` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was not 0 because `q` is not equal to '+'). Since `q` is a string and not equal to '+', no changes are made to `q`. Therefore, `M` is now 1.
