Output State: **`e` is the newly input string, `q` is the last character in the string `e`, `P` is 0, `M` is the total count of '-' characters in `e`, `i` is equal to `int(input())`, `s` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The line `P = 0` sets the variable `P` to 0, which was previously the total count of '+' characters in the string `e`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
