Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The logic in the code simply counts the number of '+' and '-' in the string and outputs the absolute difference between these counts. However, the problem requires splitting the array into subarrays in such a way that the total penalty is minimized. The current implementation does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to consider dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the optimal splits. The current solution does not achieve this and hence is incorrect.
