Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program expects an integer `s` as input, which should actually be the length of the string `e`. This is a mismatch in the expected input.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e`. However, the problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized, not just counting the '+' and '-' characters.
3. **Penalty Calculation**: The program does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. It simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation based on the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
