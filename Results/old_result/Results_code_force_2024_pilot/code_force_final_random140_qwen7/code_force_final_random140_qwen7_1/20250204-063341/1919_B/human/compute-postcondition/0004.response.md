Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0 (or 1), `s` is an input integer, `e` is the input string, `P` is 0, `M` is 0**.

The code initializes a new variable `M` and assigns it the value 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `e`, or `P`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
