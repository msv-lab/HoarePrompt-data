Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the input value from `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each integer in the range from 0 to the integer input minus 1. This means the loop will run for `int(input())` times.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The input value remains the same throughout the loop.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q` is the last character in the string `e`.
   - `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`.
   - `M` is the total count of '-' characters in `e`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 at the start of each new iteration, if the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` would be equal to `int(input())`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.

Given that the loop has completed all its iterations, the next state should reflect the condition where the loop cannot execute anymore. Therefore, `i` should be equal to `int(input())`.

6. **Final state**:
   - The state of `q`, `P`, and `M` does not change as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `i` should be set to `int(input())`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the final state since the loop has completed) is:

**State: **`q` is the last character in the string `e`, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the total count of '-' characters in `e`, `i` is equal to `int(input())`**.
