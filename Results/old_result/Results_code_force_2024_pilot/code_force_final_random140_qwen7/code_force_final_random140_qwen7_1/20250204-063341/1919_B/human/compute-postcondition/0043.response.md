Output State: **`q` is the next element in the list `e`, `P` is 2, `M` is 2**

Explanation: The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Given the initial state where `M` is 1 if the previous `q` was '+', otherwise `M` is 2, and since `P` is 2 if the previous `q` was '+', otherwise `P` is 0, the value of `M` changes from 1 to 2 (or remains 2 if it was already 2). The values of `q` and `P` remain unchanged.
