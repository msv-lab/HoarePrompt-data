Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `input()`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `input()`. 

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `i` is 0 or 1
   - `s` is an input integer
   - `e` is an empty string
   - `P` is the total number of '+' characters encountered in the string `e`
   - `M` is the total number of '-' characters encountered in the string `e`

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `input()` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - The string `e` remains empty since no processing has occurred yet.
   - The counts `P` and `M` remain 0 since no characters have been processed yet.

5. **New State**:
   - `i` will be 1 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1).
   - `input()` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `e` remains an empty string.
   - `P` remains 0.
   - `M` remains 0.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is 0, and `M` is 0**.
