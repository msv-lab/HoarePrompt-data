Output State: **`q` is the next element in the list `e`, `M` is 1 more than its original value, and `P` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Since `q` is the next element in the list `e`, and the condition for `P` being 1 (i.e., `q` being '+') is not met, `P` remains 0. Therefore, `M` is increased by 1 while `P` stays unchanged.
