### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \( n < k \)**:
     - The program correctly prints "NO" when Alice has fewer coins than the required number of jewels.
     - State: `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

   - **Case 2: \( n = k \)**:
     - The program prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
     - State: `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

   - **Case 3: \( n > k \)**:
     - The program checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \).
       - If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1 coin respectively.
       - If false, it prints "NO".
     - State: `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - For "YES" cases, the program correctly prints the number of stalls and their respective prices.
   - For "NO" cases, the program correctly prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like \( n = k \) and \( n > k \) appropriately.
   - The logic for setting up stalls and determining the prices is sound.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all given test cases accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
