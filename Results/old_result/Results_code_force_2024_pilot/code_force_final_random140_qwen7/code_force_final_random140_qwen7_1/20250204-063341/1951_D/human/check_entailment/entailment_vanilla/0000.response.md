Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Checking Basic Conditions:**
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than `k`.
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels since she spends all her coins.
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with specific prices. This condition ensures Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying 1 jewel from the first stall and the rest from the second stall.

3. **Handling Remaining Cases:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NO". This implies that the remaining cases (where `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`) are not handled correctly by the current logic.

### Detailed Check:

- **Case 1: \( n < k \)**
  - The program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

- **Case 2: \( n == k \)**
  - The program correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

- **Case 3: \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \)**
  - The program correctly prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with specific prices. However, this condition is too restrictive. It only works when Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying 1 jewel from the first stall and the rest from the second stall. This condition should be relaxed to allow more flexibility in setting up stalls.

- **Remaining Cases:**
  - The program incorrectly prints "NO" for cases where `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`. These cases should be handled by setting up more stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1: \( n = 7, k = 3 \)**
  - Expected Output: "YES"
  - Actual Output: "YES"
  - Explanation: Alice can buy 3 jewels from 3 stalls with prices 2, 2, and 2 respectively.

- **Test Case 2: \( n = 6, k = 4 \)**
  - Expected Output: "NO"
  - Actual Output: "NO"
  - Explanation: Alice cannot buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins using the current logic.

- **Test Case 3: \( n = 255, k = 8 \)**
  - Expected Output: "YES"
  - Actual Output: "YES"
  - Explanation: Alice can buy 8 jewels from 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1` properly. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

**Correctness: False**
