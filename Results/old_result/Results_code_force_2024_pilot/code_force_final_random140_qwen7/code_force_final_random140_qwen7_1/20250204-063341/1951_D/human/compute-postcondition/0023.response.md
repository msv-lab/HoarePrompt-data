Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it checks if `n` is less than `k`. If true, it prints "NO". If `n` equals `k`, it prints "YES" followed by 1 twice. If `n` is greater than `k` and `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is true, it prints "YES" followed by 2 and `n - k + 1`. If none of these conditions are met, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
