Reasoning:

1. **Function Structure**: The program iterates over each test case using a loop, which correctly handles multiple test cases as specified.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition `if n < k:` is correctly implemented to check if Alice cannot afford even one jewel from any stall, hence printing "NO".
   - The second condition `elif n == k:` is correctly implemented to check if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if the price of each stall is 1 coin, hence printing "YES" followed by 1 and 1.
   - The third condition `elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:` is intended to check if it's possible to distribute the coins among stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, this condition is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility of setting different prices for each stall to achieve the exact count of `k` jewels.
   - The final `else` block correctly handles the case where none of the above conditions are met, printing "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program fails to handle the general case where `n > k` and needs to distribute the coins across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The current logic only considers specific edge cases and does not provide a general solution.

Given the execution summary, the program does not correctly implement the logic to handle all test cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not account for the scenario where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by distributing the coins across multiple stalls with varying prices.

Correctness: **False**
