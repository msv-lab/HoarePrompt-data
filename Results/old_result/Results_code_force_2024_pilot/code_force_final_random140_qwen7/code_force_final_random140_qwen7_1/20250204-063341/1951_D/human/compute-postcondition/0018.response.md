Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` equals `k`, the function does not change `t`. Otherwise, the function evaluates whether `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)`. If the condition is true, `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. If the condition is false, `t` also remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
