You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: 'NO'
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: n - k + 1, 1
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: 'NO'
            #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than `k`, and the function evaluates whether `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)`. If the condition is true, the function does not change `t`. If the condition is false, the function also does not change `t`. Therefore, `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
        #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` equals `k`, the function does not change `t`. Otherwise, `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 regardless of the evaluation of the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)`.
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is less than `k`, then `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `t` also remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and if `n` equals `k`, `t` is unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, it processes two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The function does not return a value explicitly but processes each test case based on the given constraints and returns results for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
