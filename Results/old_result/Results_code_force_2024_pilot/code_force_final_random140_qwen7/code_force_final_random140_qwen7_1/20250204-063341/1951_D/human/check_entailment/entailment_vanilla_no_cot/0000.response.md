Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for all test cases as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Case Analysis**: The current implementation only handles a few specific cases (when `n < k`, when `n == k`, and a partial case when `k-1 < n-k+1`). However, the problem requires handling a broader range of cases, especially when setting up to 60 stalls with appropriate prices.

2. **General Solution Requirement**: The program should be able to handle any `n` and `k` within the given constraints and determine if it is possible to set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The current logic is insufficient to cover all scenarios.

3. **Output Format**: If the answer is "YES", the program should output the number of stalls and the corresponding prices, but the current implementation does not provide these details correctly for all cases.

Here is a more comprehensive approach to solve the problem:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        # Determine the number of stalls needed
        stalls = 0
        remaining_coins = n
        prices = []
        while k > 0 and stalls < 60:
            price = min(k, remaining_coins)
            prices.append(price)
            remaining_coins -= price
            k -= 1
            stalls += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(stalls)
            print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This solution iteratively sets the price for each stall such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, ensuring the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
