Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer less than `k`.
- `k` is an input integer.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since no specific values for `n` and `k` are given, and the value of `t` does not affect the print statement, the output will always be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
