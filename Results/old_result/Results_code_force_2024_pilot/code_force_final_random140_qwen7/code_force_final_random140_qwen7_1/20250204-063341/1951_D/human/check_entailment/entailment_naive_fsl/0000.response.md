Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where more than two stalls might be needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 255`, `k = 8`

According to the problem, Bob needs to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. The program only considers two cases:
1. When `n < k`, it prints "NO".
2. When `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1.
3. When `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1.

However, for `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not explore the possibility of setting up more than 2 stalls. A valid solution would involve setting up 8 stalls with prices `128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1` as shown in the example output.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases and hence is incorrect.
