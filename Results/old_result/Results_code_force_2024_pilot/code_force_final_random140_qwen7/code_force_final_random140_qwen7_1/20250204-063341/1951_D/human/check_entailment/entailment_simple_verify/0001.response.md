### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the main logic and flow of the program. However, let's systematically evaluate the program against the problem requirements and the provided examples to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which processes the input and prints the output.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It checks if `n < k`. If true, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy any jewels if she has fewer coins than the desired number of jewels.
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `1`. This means only one stall is needed with a price of 1 coin per jewel, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n > k`, it further checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying `k-1` jewels from one stall and 1 jewel from another stall.
     - If the condition holds, it prints "YES", `2`, and the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This setup allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If none of the above conditions hold, it prints "NO".

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by looping over the number of test cases and processing each one individually.

### Verification Against Examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `7 3`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Alice has 7 coins and needs to buy 3 jewels. The program correctly identifies that she can buy 3 jewels by setting up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - Actual Output: `YES`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `6 4`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: Alice has 6 coins and needs to buy 4 jewels. Since `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy 4 jewels.
   - Actual Output: `NO`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `255 8`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Alice has 255 coins and needs to buy 8 jewels. The program correctly identifies that she can buy 8 jewels by setting up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`.
   - Actual Output: `YES`

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Condition `n < k`:**
  - The program correctly identifies when Alice has fewer coins than required and prints "NO".
  
- **Condition `n == k`:**
  - The program correctly identifies when Alice has exactly the same number of coins as required and prints "YES" with 1 stall and a price of 1 coin per jewel.
  
- **Condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1`:**
  - The program correctly identifies when Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from one stall and 1 jewel from another stall.
  - The prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` are correctly calculated and printed.
  
- **General Case:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where `n > k` and the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` does not hold, printing "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected outputs for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
