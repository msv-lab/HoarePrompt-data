You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1() -> None:
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    st = set()
    for i in range(n):
        st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)
    print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    st = set()
    for i in range(n):
        st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `st` is a set containing `n` elements, each element being one of the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of `n`, indicating that all elements in the range of the loop have been processed. The set `st` will contain `n` unique elements, each of which is the sum of an element from the list `arr` and its index plus one (`arr[i] + i + 1`).
    print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))
    #This is printed: the n unique elements of st sorted in descending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data consisting of multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes the sum of each list element and its index plus one (`arr[i] + i + 1`), stores these sums in a set to ensure uniqueness, and then prints these unique sums in descending order. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the output based on the input provided.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required logic.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Inside the loop for each test case, the function `func_1()` is called.
   - The function `func_1()` initializes an empty set `st`.

3. **Inserting Elements into Set:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array, the program adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. This ensures that each element is unique because sets cannot have duplicate values.

4. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The set `st` is converted to a list and sorted in descending order.
   - The sorted list is printed.

### Correctness Check

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Set Operations:**
   - The program correctly uses a set to ensure that each element added to the set is unique.
   
2. **Element Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates `arr[i] + i + 1` for each element before adding it to the set.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the set in descending order before printing, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - The problem asks for the lexicographically largest array `b`, but since the set inherently avoids duplicates and the sorting is done in descending order, the output will be the lexicographically largest possible array.

### Conclusion

Given that the program correctly handles the set operations, element calculations, and sorting, it meets the requirements of the problem.
