Output State: **`ans` is updated by appending the next element `x` from `arr` to itself.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(x)` appends the next element `x` from the list `arr` to the list `ans`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `x` is the next element in the sequence. The precondition that `ans` contains either the first element of `arr` followed by `x` (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and less than `ans[-1]`), or the first element of `arr` with its last element decreased by 1 (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and greater than or equal to `ans[-1]`), remains valid after the append operation. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
