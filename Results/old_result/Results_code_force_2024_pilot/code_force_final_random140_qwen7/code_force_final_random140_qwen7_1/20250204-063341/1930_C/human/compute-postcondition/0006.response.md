Output State: **`i` is 3; `st` contains the value `arr[3] + 4`; `n` must be greater than 2**

Explanation: The code `st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)` adds the value of `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. Initially, `i` is 2. So, `arr[i]` becomes `arr[2]`, and `i + 1` becomes `2 + 1`, which is `3`. Therefore, `arr[i] + i + 1` becomes `arr[2] + 3`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The set `st` now contains the value `arr[2] + 3`, which is `arr[3] + 4`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
