Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing either the first element of `arr` followed by `x` (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and less than `ans[-1]`), or the first element of `arr` with its last element decreased by 1 (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and greater than or equal to `ans[-1]`); `ans` has had `x` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `ans`. The conditions for the contents of `ans` remain unchanged except for the addition of `x`.
