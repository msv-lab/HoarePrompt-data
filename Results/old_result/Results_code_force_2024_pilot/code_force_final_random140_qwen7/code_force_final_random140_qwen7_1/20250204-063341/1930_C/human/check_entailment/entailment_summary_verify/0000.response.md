### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description and Constraints**:
   - We need to perform operations on an array `a` of length `n` and a set `S`.
   - Each operation involves selecting an index `i`, inserting `a_i + i + 1` into `S`, and deleting `a_i` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
   - Finally, we need to sort the set `S` in descending order to form the array `b`.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes no input arguments and returns nothing (`None`).
   - It reads `n` and the array `arr` from input.
   - It creates a set `st` and adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to it for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It prints the elements of `st` sorted in descending order.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The set `st` is constructed by adding `arr[i] + i + 1` for each `i`.
   - The set inherently ensures that all elements are unique.
   - The elements are printed in descending order, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Deletion and Index Adjustment**:
   - The problem statement mentions that after each deletion, the indices of the remaining elements in `a` should decrease by 1. However, this is not directly relevant to the construction of the set `st`.
   - The set `st` is built based on the current values of `arr[i] + i + 1` without considering the changes in indices due to deletions. This is because the problem only requires us to construct the set with the given formula and sort it in descending order.

5. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The requirement is to find the lexicographically largest array `b` formed by sorting the set `st` in descending order.
   - Since the set `st` is built correctly and sorted in descending order, the output will be the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

Given the above points, the program correctly constructs the set `st` and sorts it in descending order, which satisfies the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct because it constructs the set `st` correctly and sorts it in descending order, which is the required output according to the problem statement.
