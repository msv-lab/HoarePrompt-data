Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `t` to an integer between 1 and 10^4 as per the initial state, and introduces a new variable `n` which is set to the integer input. The list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on them.
