Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to achieve the lexicographically largest possible array \( b \). Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Order**: The program simply adds \( a_i + i + 1 \) to the set \( S \) without considering the deletion of \( a_i \) and the subsequent changes in indices. This means it doesn't simulate the actual operations as described in the problem statement.

2. **Set Operations**: The set \( S \) is being populated with values \( a_i + i + 1 \), but the problem specifies that \( i \) should be selected such that \( 1 \leq i \leq |a| \) and then \( a_i + i \) should be inserted (without the extra +1).

3. **Lexicographical Maximization**: The program sorts the set \( S \) in descending order directly, but it doesn't ensure that the operations are performed in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final array \( b \).

### Correct Approach:
To achieve the lexicographically largest \( b \), you need to carefully choose \( i \) at each step to maximize the value added to the set \( S \). Specifically, you should always add the maximum possible value that can be obtained by \( a_i + i \).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Sort the array in ascending order
    arr.sort()
    
    st = set()
    for i in range(n):
        # Add the maximum possible value a_i + i
        st.add(arr[n-1-i] + i)
    
    # Convert the set to a sorted list in descending order
    b = sorted(st, reverse=True)
    print(' '.join(map(str, b)))
```

This approach ensures that at each step, the maximum possible value is added to the set \( S \), leading to the lexicographically largest possible array \( b \).
