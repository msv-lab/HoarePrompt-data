Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and `arr` is a list of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 10^9, obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
