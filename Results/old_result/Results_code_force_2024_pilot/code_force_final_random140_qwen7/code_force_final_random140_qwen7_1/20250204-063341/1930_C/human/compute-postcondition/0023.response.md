To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is a list containing all elements from `arr` after processing according to the given rules. However, the specific processing rules are not provided in the initial state description.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

Given the initial state, we know that `ans` is a list, but we do not have any information about the contents of `ans` or how it was processed from `arr`. Since no specific processing rules are mentioned, we assume that `ans` is simply a list of elements from `arr`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **what is printed (where what is printed is the elements of the list ans separated by spaces)**
