Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element is the sum of the index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer input, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for x in arr[1:]:
    if x >= ans[-1]:
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    else:
        ans.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing either the first element of `arr` followed by `x` (where `x` is the second element of `arr` and less than `ans[-1]`), or the first element of `arr` with its last element decreased by 1 (where `x` is the second element of `arr` and greater than or equal to `ans[-1]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing either the first element of `arr` followed by `x` (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and less than `ans[-1]`), or the first element of `arr` with its last element decreased by 1 (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and greater than or equal to `ans[-1]`); in the case where `x >= ans[-1]`, `ans`'s last element is decreased by 1, otherwise `x` is appended to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is a list. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, then the last element of `ans` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the next element `x` from `arr` is appended to `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
