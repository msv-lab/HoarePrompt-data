Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a` in descending order, then iterates through the sorted list to create a new list `ans`. This new list `ans` contains elements processed according to specific rules: starting with the first element of the sorted list, each subsequent element is either the previous element decremented by one or the current element itself, whichever is greater. Finally, the function prints the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.**
