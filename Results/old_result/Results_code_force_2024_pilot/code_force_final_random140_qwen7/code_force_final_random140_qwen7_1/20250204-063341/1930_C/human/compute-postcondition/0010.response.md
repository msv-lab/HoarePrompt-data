Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `st` is a set containing `n` elements, each element being one of the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of `n`, indicating that all elements in the range of the loop have been processed. The set `st` will contain `n` unique elements, each of which is the sum of an element from the list `arr` and its index plus one (`arr[i] + i + 1`).
