Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `st` contains the value `arr[0] + 1`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, if `i` is currently `1`, it means the loop has already executed once.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be `2`.

5. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than `2` for the loop to execute again.

6. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be updated to `2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `2`.

7. **State of `st`**:
   - The state of `st` does not change within the loop head, so it remains as `st` contains the value `arr[0] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `st` contains the value `arr[0] + 1`, `n` must be greater than 2**
