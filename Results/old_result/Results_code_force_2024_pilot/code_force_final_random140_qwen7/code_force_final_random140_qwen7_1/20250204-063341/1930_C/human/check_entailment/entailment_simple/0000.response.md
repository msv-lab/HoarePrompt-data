Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing the set \( S \) by inserting \( a_i + i + 1 \) for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), and then sorting this set in descending order to form the array \( b \).
2. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of test cases \( t \) and iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
4. It then constructs the set \( S \) by adding \( a_i + i + 1 \) for each \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).
5. Finally, it prints the elements of \( S \) sorted in descending order.

Given the problem constraints and the steps taken in the program, the program correctly implements the required logic. The set \( S \) is constructed with unique elements as required, and the final output is sorted in descending order.

Correctness: **True**
