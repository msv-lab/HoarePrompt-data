Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and `arr` is a list of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
