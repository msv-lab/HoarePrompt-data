Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the deletion of elements from the array `a` as described in the problem statement. Specifically, after inserting `a_i + i + 1` into the set `st`, it does not adjust the indices of the remaining elements in `a` to reflect the removal of `a_i`. This means that the set `st` will contain values that do not correspond to the actual state of the array `a` after deletions.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
6 4 8
```

According to the problem description, the steps would be:
1. Select `i = 1`, insert `6 + 1 = 7` into `S`, delete `6` from `a`. Now `a = [4, 8]`.
2. Select `i = 1`, insert `4 + 1 = 5` into `S`, delete `4` from `a`. Now `a = [8]`.
3. Select `i = 1`, insert `8 + 1 = 9` into `S`, delete `8` from `a`. Now `a = []`.

Thus, the set `S` should be `{9, 7, 5}` in decreasing order, which is `[9, 7, 5]`.

However, the program outputs `[9, 5, 7]` because it does not adjust the indices of the remaining elements in `a` after each deletion. Therefore, the program does not produce the lexicographically largest possible array `b` as required by the problem description.
