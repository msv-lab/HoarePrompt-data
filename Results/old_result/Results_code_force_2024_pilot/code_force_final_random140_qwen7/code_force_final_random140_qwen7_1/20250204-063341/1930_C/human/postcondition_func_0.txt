The function processes input data consisting of multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes the sum of each list element and its index plus one (`arr[i] + i + 1`), stores these sums in a set to ensure uniqueness, and then prints these unique sums in descending order. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the output based on the input provided.
