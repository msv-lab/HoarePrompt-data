Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element.
   - `ans` is a list containing either the first element of `arr` followed by `x` (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and less than `ans[-1]`), or the first element of `arr` with its last element decreased by 1 (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and greater than or equal to `ans[-1]`); in the case where `x >= ans[-1]`, `ans`'s last element is decreased by 1, otherwise `x` is appended to `ans`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, meaning it starts from the second element of `arr`.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which takes the value of each element in `arr[1:]` during each iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `arr[1:]`, the next value of `x` will be the next element in `arr` after the current one.
   - The state of `arr` itself does not change within the loop; it remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - The state of `ans` will depend on the value of `x` and the condition specified in the problem statement.

5. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume the previous iteration processed the element `x` from `arr[1:]`.
   - After processing, `ans` might have been updated based on the conditions given.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `arr` after the one processed in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `x` will be the second element of `arr` if the previous `x` was the first element, the third element if the previous `x` was the second element, and so on.

7. **Updated States:**
   - `t` and `n` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.
   - `arr` remains the same.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

Given this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `x` will be the next element in `arr` after the one processed in the previous iteration.
- `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

Since `arr` is not changing, we don't need to update it explicitly. We only need to focus on `x` and `ans`.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element.
- `ans` is a list containing either the first element of `arr` followed by `x` (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and less than `ans[-1]`), or the first element of `arr` with its last element decreased by 1 (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and greater than or equal to `ans[-1]`); in the case where `x >= ans[-1]`, `ans`'s last element is decreased by 1, otherwise `x` is appended to `ans`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing either the first element of `arr` followed by `x` (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and less than `ans[-1]`), or the first element of `arr` with its last element decreased by 1 (where `x` is the next element of `arr` and greater than or equal to `ans[-1]`); in the case where `x >= ans[-1]`, `ans`'s last element is decreased by 1, otherwise `x` is appended to `ans`.**
