Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers input during the last iteration of the loop. No changes are made to `t` during the loop's execution.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` remains the same as its initial value, and `n`, `m`, and `k` take on the values from the last set of inputs provided to the loop. The loop does not modify `t` unless one of the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is met, but since these conditions do not change `t` and we are considering the final state after all iterations, `t` remains unchanged.
