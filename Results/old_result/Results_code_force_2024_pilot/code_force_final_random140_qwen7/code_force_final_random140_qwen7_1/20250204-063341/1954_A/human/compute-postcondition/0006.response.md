Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- The condition \((n > k \text{ and } n - \mathit{math.ceil}(n / m) > k)\) holds true.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, as long as the condition is satisfied. Since the condition is already given to be true, it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **Yes**
