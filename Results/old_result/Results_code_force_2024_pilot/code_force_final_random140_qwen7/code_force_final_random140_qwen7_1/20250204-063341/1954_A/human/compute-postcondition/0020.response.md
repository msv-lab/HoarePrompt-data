Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a tuple containing three positive integers (n, m, k) where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50 and n ≤ 1000. It returns a value based on the relationship between these integers.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three integers (n, m, k) through a tuple and checks their relationships, returning a value accordingly.
