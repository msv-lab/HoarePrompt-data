Reasoning:
The given program aims to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The logic in the program needs to be carefully analyzed to ensure it correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement.

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The program checks if \( n \leq k \) or if \( n - \lceil n / m \rceil \leq k \).
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', indicating that Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts have the same color.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES', indicating that Alice can achieve her goal.

2. **Condition \( n \leq k \)**:
   - This condition is straightforward. If Bob can repaint at most \( k \) parts, and there are \( n \) parts, then if \( n \leq k \), Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Thus, this condition is correct.

3. **Condition \( n - \lceil n / m \rceil \leq k \)**:
   - Here, \( \lceil n / m \rceil \) represents the minimum number of different colors needed to paint the ribbon such that no single color is used more than \( \lceil n / m \rceil \) times.
   - If \( n - \lceil n / m \rceil \leq k \), it means Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, even if Alice tries to distribute the colors as evenly as possible. Therefore, this condition is also correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop to process each test case individually.
   - The input constraints (\( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \)) are respected.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The conditions are correctly checked, and the output is printed appropriately for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
