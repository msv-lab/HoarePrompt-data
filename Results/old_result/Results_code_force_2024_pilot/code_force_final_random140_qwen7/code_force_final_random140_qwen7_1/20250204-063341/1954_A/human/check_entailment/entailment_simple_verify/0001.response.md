### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `n <= k`: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, making it impossible for Alice to prevent this. Hence, the output is 'NO'.
     2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be painted differently to ensure that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color is within the limit `k`. Specifically, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that no single color can cover all parts when repainted by Bob. If subtracting this from `n` results in a value less than or equal to `k`, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Hence, the output is 'Yes'.

3. **Output**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The first condition `n <= k` is straightforward and correctly identifies cases where Bob can always repaint all parts.
- The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is more complex but also correct. It ensures that if the number of parts that need to be painted differently (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is within the limit `k`, then Alice can achieve her goal.

### Edge Cases:
- When `n == k`, the second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` might not hold true for all values of `m`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 2`, then `math.ceil(n / m) = 3`, and `5 - 3 = 2`, which is equal to `k`. This means Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, which is correct.
- The program handles all edge cases correctly by checking both conditions.

However, upon closer inspection, we find that the second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` does not fully capture the requirement. Specifically, it does not consider the scenario where `n` is significantly larger than `k` and `m` is small enough to allow Alice to paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
- Input: `5 2 2`
- Expected Output: `YES`

Here, `n = 5`, `m = 2`, and `k = 2`. According to the given logic:
- `math.ceil(n / m) = math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3`
- `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`

Since `2 <= 2`, the program incorrectly outputs 'YES'. However, Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that ensures Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. For example, painting the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` ensures that even if Bob repainted up to 2 parts, he cannot make all parts the same color.

### Correct Approach:
A more accurate approach would be to check if `m * k < n`. If this condition holds, then Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if m * k < n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate because it did not correctly handle all edge cases and scenarios. The corrected program should use the condition `m * k < n` to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Final: **False**
