### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `n <= k`: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, making it impossible for Alice to prevent this. Hence, the output is 'NO'.
     2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be painted differently to ensure that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color is within the limit `k`. Specifically, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that no single color can cover all parts when repainted by Bob. If subtracting this from `n` results in a value less than or equal to `k`, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Hence, the output is 'Yes'.

3. **Output**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The first condition `n <= k` is straightforward and correctly identifies cases where Bob can always repaint all parts.
- The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is more complex but also correct. It ensures that if the number of parts that need to be painted differently (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is within the limit `k`, then Alice can achieve her goal.

### Edge Cases:
- When `n == k`, the second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` might not hold true for all values of `m`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 2`, then `math.ceil(n / m) = 3`, and `5 - 3 = 2`, which is equal to `k`. This means Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, which is correct.
- The program handles all edge cases correctly by checking both conditions.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
