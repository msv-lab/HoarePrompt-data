Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then no changes are made to `t`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than `k`, then no changes are made to `t` as well.
