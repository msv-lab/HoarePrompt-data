You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \leq k \) or if \( n - \lceil n/m \rceil \leq k \). If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `n <= k`: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, making it impossible for Alice to prevent this. Hence, the output is 'NO'.
     2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be painted differently to ensure that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color is within the limit `k`. Specifically, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that no single color can cover all parts when repainted by Bob. If subtracting this from `n` results in a value less than or equal to `k`, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Hence, the output is 'Yes'.

3. **Output**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The first condition `n <= k` is straightforward and correctly identifies cases where Bob can always repaint all parts.
- The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is more complex but also correct. It ensures that if the number of parts that need to be painted differently (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is within the limit `k`, then Alice can achieve her goal.

### Edge Cases:
- When `n == k`, the second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` might not hold true for all values of `m`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 2`, then `math.ceil(n / m) = 3`, and `5 - 3 = 2`, which is equal to `k`. This means Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, which is correct.
- The program handles all edge cases correctly by checking both conditions.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Correctness: **True**
