Reasoning:
The provided solution checks whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The logic used in the code is as follows:

1. If `n <= k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, this means that even after Alice paints the ribbon, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
3. Otherwise, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, so the answer is 'Yes'.

Let's verify this against the examples provided:

- For the test case `1 1 1`: `n <= k` is true, so the output is 'NO'.
- For the test case `5 1 1`: `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is true, so the output is 'NO'.
- For the test case `5 2 1`: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is true, so the output is 'NO'.
- For the test case `5 2 2`: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is false, so the output is 'YES'.
- For the test case `5 5 3`: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is false, so the output is 'YES'.

The logic in the code matches the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
