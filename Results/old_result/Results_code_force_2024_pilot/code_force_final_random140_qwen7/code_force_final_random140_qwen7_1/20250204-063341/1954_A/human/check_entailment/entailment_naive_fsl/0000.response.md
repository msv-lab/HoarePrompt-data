Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m` is greater than `k` and `n` is also greater than `k`. According to the problem description, if `n > k` and `m > 1`, Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. However, the current implementation fails to consider this scenario correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
3 2 1
```
Here, `n = 3`, `m = 2`, and `k = 1`. In this case, Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1]`. No matter which part Bob repaints, he cannot make all parts the same color because there are two different colors and only one part can be repainted.

The current implementation incorrectly prints 'NO' for this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
