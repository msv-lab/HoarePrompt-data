Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs up to the third iteration with the given conditions, `t` must initially be at least 3 to allow for all iterations to complete.
