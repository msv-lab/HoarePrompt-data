The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (representing the number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and lists of integers `a_i` and `x_i`. If the input is valid, it executes a series of operations defined within `func_1()` for each test case. If the input is invalid (i.e., not a valid integer), it prints 'Invalid input format' and returns `None`. The function ensures that `t` is an integer and is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, allowing all test cases to be processed.
