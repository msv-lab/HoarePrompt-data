Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by `b[3]`**.

Explanation: The code `r -= b[i]` decreases the value of `r` by `b[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `r` is decreased by `b[3]`. The conditions for `n` and the behavior of `r` relative to `b[i]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
