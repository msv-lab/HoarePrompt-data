Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in the list `b` from index 1 to `n`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
