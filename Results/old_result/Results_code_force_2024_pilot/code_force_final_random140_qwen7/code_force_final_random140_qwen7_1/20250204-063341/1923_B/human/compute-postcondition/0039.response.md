Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `b` is a list of `n+1` integers initialized to 0. After the loop executes all its iterations, `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in the list `b` from index 1 to `n`. If the input format is invalid, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns.**

Explanation: The `try` block reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the list `a` and then iterates through a series of inputs to update the list `b`. After the loop, `r` is calculated based on the value of `k` and the elements in `b`. If the input format is incorrect, a `ValueError` is raised, and the function prints 'Invalid input format'. Therefore, the program checks the input format and performs the necessary calculations only if the input is valid.
