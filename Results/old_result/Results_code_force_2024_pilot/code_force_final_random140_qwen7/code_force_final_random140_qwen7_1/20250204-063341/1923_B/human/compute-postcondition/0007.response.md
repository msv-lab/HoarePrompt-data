Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.

Natural Language Description: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, and each iteration decrements `t` by 1. Since the loop executed up to 3 times, `t` must have been at least 3 initially and has now been reduced to 0 or a negative number, but it cannot be less than 0 because the loop would have stopped before completing all iterations. Therefore, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
