Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by `b[2]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `r` is increased by `k`. The code `r -= b[i]` subtracts the value of `b[i]` (where `i` is 2) from `r`. Since `i` is 2, `r` is now decreased by `b[2]`. The conditions and values of `n` and the unchanged behavior of the function (returning None if `r` was less than `b[i]`) do not affect the updated value of `r`.
