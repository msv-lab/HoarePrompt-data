Output State: **`t` is an integer, and it must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations. If the input is not a valid integer, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns None.**

Natural Language Description: The `try` block attempts to read an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function `func_1()` is called. If the input is not a valid integer, a `ValueError` is raised, and the program catches this exception, printing 'Invalid input format'. In this case, the function returns `None`. Therefore, `t` must be an integer and must be large enough to accommodate all the test cases, ensuring that the loop can run through all iterations without encountering a `ValueError`.
