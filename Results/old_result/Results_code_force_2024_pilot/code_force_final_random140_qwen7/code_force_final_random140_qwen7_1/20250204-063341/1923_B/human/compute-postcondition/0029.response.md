Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `k`.**

The code `r += k` increments the value of `r` by the value of `k`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r` or `k`, the only thing we can definitively say is that `r` has been increased by `k`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
