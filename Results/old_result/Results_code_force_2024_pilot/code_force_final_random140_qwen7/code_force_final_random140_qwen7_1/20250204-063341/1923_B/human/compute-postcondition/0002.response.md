Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignment or modification of variables), the only precondition that remains unchanged is that `t` must be greater than 0. No new values are assigned to `t` or any other variables, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
