Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the movement and shooting of monsters as described in the problem. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the total health of monsters at each position and does not account for the fact that monsters can move towards the player and potentially reach the player's position.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2
1 1
-1 1
```

According to the problem description, the player should be able to survive and kill both monsters because the player can shoot one bullet at each monster in the first second, and both monsters will die simultaneously.

However, the program `func_1` will output `NO` because it incorrectly sums the health of monsters at each position and does not properly handle the movement of monsters.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate the movement and shooting of monsters step-by-step, ensuring that the player can always target the closest monsters first and handle the movement of monsters accurately.
