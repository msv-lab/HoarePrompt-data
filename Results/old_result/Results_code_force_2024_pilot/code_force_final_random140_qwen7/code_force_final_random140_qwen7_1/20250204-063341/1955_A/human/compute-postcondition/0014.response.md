Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the new integer input.
   - `a` is the second integer input.
   - `b` is the third integer input.
   - `s1` is calculated as `n * a`.
   - `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(min(s1, s2))
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to compare the values of `s1` and `s2`:

- `s1 = n * a`
- `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`

### Analysis:
- If `n` is even, then `n // 2` is an integer and `n % 2` is 0. Therefore, `s2` simplifies to `b * (n // 2)`.
- If `n` is odd, then `n // 2` is an integer and `n % 2` is 1. Therefore, `s2` simplifies to `b * (n // 2) + a`.

In both cases, `s1` is `n * a` and `s2` depends on whether `n` is even or odd.

### Comparison:
- If `n` is even:
  - `s1 = n * a`
  - `s2 = b * (n // 2)`
  - Since `n // 2` is an integer, `s2` is half of `n * a` (if `b = a`), but generally, it is less than or equal to `n * a` unless `b` is significantly larger.

- If `n` is odd:
  - `s1 = n * a`
  - `s2 = b * (n // 2) + a`
  - Again, `s2` is less than or equal to `n * a` unless `b` is significantly larger.

Given that `s1` is always `n * a` and `s2` is either `b * (n // 2)` or `b * (n // 2) + a`, the minimum value between `s1` and `s2` will be `s2` if `b` is smaller than `a` or equal to `a`, and `s1` otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the minimum of `n * a` and `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

Output: **min(n * a, b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a)**
