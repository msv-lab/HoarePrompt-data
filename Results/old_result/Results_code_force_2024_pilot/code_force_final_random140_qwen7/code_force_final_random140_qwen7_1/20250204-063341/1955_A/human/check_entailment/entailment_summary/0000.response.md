Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying \(n\) yogurts.
- It iterates over each test case using a loop that runs for the number of test cases specified by the user.
- For each test case, it calculates the total cost without any promotion (\(s1 = n \times a\)) and with the promotion applied (\(s2 = b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a\)).
- It then prints the minimum of these two values, which is the optimal cost for Maxim to buy \(n\) yogurts.
- The program does not return any value after processing all test cases, but this is acceptable since the problem statement does not require a return value; it just requires printing the results for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
