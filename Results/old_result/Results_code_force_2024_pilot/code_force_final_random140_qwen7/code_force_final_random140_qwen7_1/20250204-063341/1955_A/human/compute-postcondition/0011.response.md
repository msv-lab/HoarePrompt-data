Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is `n * a`, `s2` is updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `t`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is still valid. The values of `s1` and `s2` are updated based on the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
