Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is `n * a`, `s2` is `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s2` based on the inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, `s2` is set to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
