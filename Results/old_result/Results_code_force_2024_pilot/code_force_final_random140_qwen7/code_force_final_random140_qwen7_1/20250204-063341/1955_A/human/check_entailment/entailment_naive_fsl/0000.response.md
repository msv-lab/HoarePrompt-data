Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given promotion rules. 

- For each test case, the program first calculates the total cost without using any promotion (`s1 = n * a`).
- It then calculates the total cost using the promotion for as many pairs of yogurts as possible (`s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`), which ensures that the remaining yogurts are bought individually if necessary.
- Finally, it prints the minimum of these two costs.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly. For instance:
- In the first test case (2 yogurts, regular price 5, promotion price 9), the minimum cost is 9.
- In the second test case (3 yogurts, regular price 5, promotion price 9), the minimum cost is 14 (buy one pair for 9 and one individual for 5).
- In the third test case (3 yogurts, regular price 5, promotion price 11), the minimum cost is 15 (buy one pair for 11 and one individual for 5).
- In the fourth test case (4 yogurts, regular price 5, promotion price 11), the minimum cost is 20 (buy two pairs for 22, but since we need to minimize, we can buy two pairs for 22 and adjust to 20).

Since the program correctly implements the logic for all described scenarios, it is correct.
