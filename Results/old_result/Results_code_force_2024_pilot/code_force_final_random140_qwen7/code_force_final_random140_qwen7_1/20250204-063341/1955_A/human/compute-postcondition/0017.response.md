Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). The function returns a result based on the values of n, a, and b for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integer values for t, n, a, and b. For each set of these values, the function performs some operation (not specified here) and returns a result based on the values of n, a, and b.
