Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer input
- `a` is the second integer input
- `b` is the third integer input
- `s1` is the product of `n` and `a` (\(s1 = n \times a\))
- `s2` is `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a` (\(s2 = b \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + \text{remainder} \times a\))

### For Loop Statement
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head does not explicitly mention any variables being modified or used directly within the loop. The loop simply takes an integer input and iterates that many times.
2. **Input Handling**: The loop will take an integer input for each iteration. This means the number of iterations is determined by the input value.
3. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop head does not modify any of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s1`, `s2`), these values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Conclusion
Since the loop head does not modify any of the variables mentioned, the states of these variables remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is the product of `n` and `a`, `s2` is `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**

This is the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
