Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` as specified.
3. It calculates two possible total costs:
   - `s1 = n * a`: This represents the cost if Maxim buys all yogurts at the regular price.
   - `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`: This represents the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
4. The program then prints the minimum of these two costs, which is the optimal solution according to the problem statement.
5. The logic for calculating `s2` ensures that Maxim gets the best deal by maximizing the use of the promotion while still accounting for any remaining yogurts that cannot be paired.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
