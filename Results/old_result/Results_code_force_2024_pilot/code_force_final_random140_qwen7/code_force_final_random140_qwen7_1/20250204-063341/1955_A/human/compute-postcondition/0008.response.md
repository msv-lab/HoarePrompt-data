Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is `n * a`, `s2` is updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, and `s1` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s2` to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s1`, and the expressions they are involved in remain unchanged except for `s2`.
