Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is `n * a`, `s2` is `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, and `s1` is updated to `n * a`**.

Explanation: The code `s1 = n * a` updates the value of `s1` to be the product of `n` and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
