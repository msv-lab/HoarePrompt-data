Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is the product of `n` and `a`.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `n` by `a` and assigns the result to `s1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
