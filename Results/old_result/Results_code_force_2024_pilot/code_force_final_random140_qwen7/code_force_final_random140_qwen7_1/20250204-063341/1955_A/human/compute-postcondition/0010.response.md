Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which represents the number of iterations the loop will run.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `a` is the second integer input.
   - `b` is the third integer input.
   - `s1` is `n * a`.
   - `s2` is updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, and `s1` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - In each iteration, the user provides another integer input, which determines the number of times the loop will run.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs based on the input from the user, the only thing that changes is the number of iterations left.
   - After each iteration, the user provides a new integer input, which becomes the new value for the loop counter.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same as it was initially defined.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `s1` remains unchanged.
   - `s2` will be updated based on the new value of `n` (which is the new input).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the new integer input provided by the user.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- `s1` remains unchanged.
- `s2` is updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

Since the loop is controlled by the input, the only thing that changes is `n` and the loop counter. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `s1` is `n * a`, `s2` is updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**.
