Output State: `once` is either True or False, `ans` is either the value of the last element in `arr` whose frequency is 0 or 1, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `once` will retain its last updated value (either True or False). The variable `ans` will hold the value of the last element in `arr` that meets one of the following conditions: its frequency is 0, or its frequency is 1 and `once` was False when it was processed. The variable `counter` will reflect the frequency of each element in the original array `arr`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating the last index of the array that was processed in the loop. The variable `n` remains unchanged, representing the length of the array `arr`.
