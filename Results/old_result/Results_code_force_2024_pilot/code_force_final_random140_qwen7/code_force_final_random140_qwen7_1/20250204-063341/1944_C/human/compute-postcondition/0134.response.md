Output State: **`counter[i]` is incremented by 1, `counter[i]` is now equal to its previous value plus one**.

Explanation: The code `counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1` increments the value of `counter[i]` by 1. Since `counter[i]` was already equal to its previous value plus one before the code execution, the new value of `counter[i]` is its previous value plus one again. Therefore, `counter[i]` is incremented by 1, making it equal to its previous value plus one.
