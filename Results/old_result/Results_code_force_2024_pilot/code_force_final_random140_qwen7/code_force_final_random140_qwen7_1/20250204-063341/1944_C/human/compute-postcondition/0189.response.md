Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`. The value of `ans` will be the highest unique element in `arr` plus one if such an element exists, otherwise it will be the highest unique element. The variable `once` will be True if at least one element with a frequency of 1 was found before encountering an element with a frequency of 0. The variable `i` will be set to the last index of `arr`, and `n` will remain as the length of `arr`. The `counter` dictionary will reflect the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `ans` will hold the value of the highest unique element in `arr` plus one if such an element exists, otherwise it will hold the value of the highest unique element. The variable `once` will be True if at least one element with a frequency of 1 was found before encountering an element with a frequency of 0. The variable `i` will be set to the last index of `arr`, and `n` will remain as the length of `arr`. The `counter` dictionary will reflect the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
