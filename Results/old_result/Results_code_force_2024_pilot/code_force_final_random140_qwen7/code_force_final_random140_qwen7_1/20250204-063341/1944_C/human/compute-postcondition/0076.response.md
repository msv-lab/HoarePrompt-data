Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the variable being iterated over.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the iteration.

3. **Understand the loop execution conditions**:
   - The loop will start when `i` is less than `n`.
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 after each iteration until `i` reaches `n`.

4. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `once` is `False`.
   - `ans` is `0`.
   - `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - `i` is the last element processed in `arr`.
   - `arr` and `n` remain as they were initially.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being the last element processed in `arr`, we need to set `i` to 0 (the starting value for the range function).
   - `n` should be the length of `arr` because the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`once` is False, `ans` is 0, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr`**
