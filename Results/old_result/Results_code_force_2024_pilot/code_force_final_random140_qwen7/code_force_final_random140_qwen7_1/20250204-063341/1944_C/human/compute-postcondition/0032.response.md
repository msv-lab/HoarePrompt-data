Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and either the counter at index `i` is 0, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the counter at index `i` is not 0, in which case `once` is True. If the counter at index `i` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the counter at index `i` is not 1, the conditions remain unchanged.
