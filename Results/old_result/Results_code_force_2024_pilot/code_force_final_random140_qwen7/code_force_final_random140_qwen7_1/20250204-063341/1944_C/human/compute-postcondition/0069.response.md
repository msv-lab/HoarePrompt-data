Output State: **`i` is a different element in `arr`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `counter` is a dictionary with key `n-1` and value 1, `counter[i]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the count of the element `i` in the `counter` dictionary. Since `i` was not previously a key in the dictionary, `counter.get(i, 0)` returns 0, and then 1 is added to it, making `counter[i]` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
