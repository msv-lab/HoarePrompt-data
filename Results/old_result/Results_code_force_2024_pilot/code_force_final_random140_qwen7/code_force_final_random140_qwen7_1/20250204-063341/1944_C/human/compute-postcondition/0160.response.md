Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `once` is either False or True, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` was initially False, `once` becomes True. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
