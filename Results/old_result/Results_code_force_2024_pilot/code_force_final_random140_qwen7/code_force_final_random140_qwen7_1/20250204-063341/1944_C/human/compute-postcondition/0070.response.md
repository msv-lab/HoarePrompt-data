Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one element left in `arr`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is a different element in `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `counter` is a dictionary with key `n-1` and value 1.
   - `counter[i]` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was a different element in `arr` during the previous iteration, `arr` now has one less element.
   - `arr` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `counter` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.
   - `i` will now be the next element in `arr`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `arr`, and `arr` still has at least one element.

**State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `counter` is a dictionary with key `n-1` and value 1, `counter[i]` is 1**
