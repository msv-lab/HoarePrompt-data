Output State: **`counter[i]' is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `counter[i]` by incrementing it by 1. If `i` is already a key in the dictionary `counter`, its value is retrieved and incremented by 1. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary, `counter.get(i, 0)` returns 0, and then 1 is added to it, setting `counter[i]` to 1. In both cases, `counter[i]` is updated.
