Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `counter[i]` is the count of `i` in `arr` incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the count of the element `i` in the dictionary `counter`. Since `i` is the next element in `arr`, `counter[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions for `arr` and `i` remain unchanged, but now `counter[i]` reflects the updated count of `i` in `arr`.
