Output State: **`counter` is an empty dictionary, `t` is an integer input from the user that must be in the range [1, 20000], `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `counter`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
