Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `i` and `ans`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no other variables are updated or affected by the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged.
