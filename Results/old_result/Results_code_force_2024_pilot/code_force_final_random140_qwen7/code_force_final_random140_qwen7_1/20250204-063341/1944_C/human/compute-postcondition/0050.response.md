Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, once is True**

Explanation: The variable `once` is set to `True`, which was not previously defined. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` must still be greater than 2, and `once` is now `True`.
