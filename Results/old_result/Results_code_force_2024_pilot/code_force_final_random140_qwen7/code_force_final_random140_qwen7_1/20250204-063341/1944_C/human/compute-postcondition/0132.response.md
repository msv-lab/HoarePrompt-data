Output State: **`counter[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `counter[i]` is now equal to its previous value plus one.**

Explanation: The code `counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1` increments the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary. Since `counter.get(i, 0)` returns the current count of `i` (or 0 if `i` is not yet in the dictionary), adding 1 to it increments the count. The initial state is that `counter[i]` is incremented by 1, and `i` is the next element in `arr`. After executing the code, `counter[i]` is updated to its previous value plus one, while `i` remains the next element in `arr`.
