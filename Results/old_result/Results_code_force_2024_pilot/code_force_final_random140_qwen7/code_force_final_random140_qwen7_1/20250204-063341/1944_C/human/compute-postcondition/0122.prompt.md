Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `once` is False, `ans` is 0, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is the last element processed in `arr`, `arr` and `n` remain as they were initially.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `once` is False, `ans` is 0, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr`. If the frequency of the current element (`arr[i]`) is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the frequency of the current element (`arr[i]`) is exactly 1, we either update `once` to True and set `ans` to `i + 1`, or maintain the original state where `once` is False and `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `once` is either True or False, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr`. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` and `once` is False, then `once` becomes True and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `once` remains False and `ans` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `once` is either True or False, `ans` is either 3 or 4, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `arr`. If the frequency of `i` (which is 3) in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is set to 3. Otherwise, if the frequency of `i` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to 4. Otherwise, `ans` remains 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
