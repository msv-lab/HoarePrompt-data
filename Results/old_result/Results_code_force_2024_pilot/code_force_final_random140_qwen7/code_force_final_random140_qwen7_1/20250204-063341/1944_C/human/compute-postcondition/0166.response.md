Output State: **`ans` is 1, `once` is either False or True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 1, to `ans`. The values of `once` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 due to the assignment, making it 2.
