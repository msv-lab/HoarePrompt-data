Output State: `once` is either True or False, `ans` is either the highest unique element's value plus one or the highest unique element's value, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `ans` will hold the value of the highest unique element in `arr` plus one if such an element exists, otherwise it will hold the value of the highest unique element. The variable `once` will be True if at least one element with a frequency of 1 was found before encountering an element with a frequency of 0. The variable `i` will be set to the last index of `arr`, and `n` will remain as the length of `arr`. The `counter` dictionary will reflect the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
