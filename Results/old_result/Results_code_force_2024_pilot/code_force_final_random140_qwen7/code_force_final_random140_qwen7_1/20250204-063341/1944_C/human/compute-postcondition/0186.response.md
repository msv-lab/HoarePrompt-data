Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` remains 3. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` is True, then `ans` is set to 4. If `counter.get(i, 0)` does not equal 1, then `ans` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
