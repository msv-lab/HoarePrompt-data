Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, making `i` equal to `n-1`. The code snippet then takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while `i` remains unchanged at `n-1`.
