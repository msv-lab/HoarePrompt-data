Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `ans`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since the initial state of these variables is given and no operation is performed on them within the provided code snippet, their values remain unchanged.
