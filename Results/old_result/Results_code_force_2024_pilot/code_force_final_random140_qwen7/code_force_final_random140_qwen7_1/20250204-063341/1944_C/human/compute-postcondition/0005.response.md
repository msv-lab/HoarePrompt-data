Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` will take on the values from the list `arr` during each iteration.
   - `arr` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
   - Since `i` will take on the values from `arr`, if `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The state of `i` is not directly modifiable since it will take on the values from `arr` during each iteration.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `counter` is an empty dictionary, which is not relevant to the loop execution.
   - `t` is an integer input from the user that must be in the range [1, 20000], which is also not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `n` is an input integer, which is not directly related to the loop execution.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` must contain at least one element**
