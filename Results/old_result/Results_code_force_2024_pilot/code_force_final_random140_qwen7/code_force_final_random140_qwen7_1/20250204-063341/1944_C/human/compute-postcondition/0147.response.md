Output State: **`once` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the counter at index `i` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `once = True` does not change the value of `once` but explicitly sets it to `True`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and the counter at index `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
