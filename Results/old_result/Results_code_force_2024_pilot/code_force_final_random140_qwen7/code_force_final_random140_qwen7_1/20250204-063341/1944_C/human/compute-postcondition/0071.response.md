Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `counter` is a dictionary with key `n-1` and value 1, `counter[i]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1` checks if the key `i` exists in the dictionary `counter`. If it does, it retrieves its value; otherwise, it uses 0 as the default value. Since `counter[i]` was initially 1, the code increments it by 1, making `counter[i]` equal to 2. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
