Output State: **All elements in `arr` have been iterated over, and their counts have been stored in `counter`.**

In this final output state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning every element in the list `arr` has been processed exactly once. The variable `counter` now contains the count of each unique element present in `arr`. The other variables (`once`, `ans`, `i`, `n`, `t`) remain in their initial or last updated states as they were not modified within the loop body.
