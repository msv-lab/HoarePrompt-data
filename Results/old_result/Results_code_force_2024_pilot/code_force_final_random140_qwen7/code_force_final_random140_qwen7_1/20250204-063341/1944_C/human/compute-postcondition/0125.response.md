Output State: **`once` is either True or False, `ans` is either the highest unique element's value plus one or the highest unique element's value, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables (`once`, `ans`, `counter`, `i`, `n`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
