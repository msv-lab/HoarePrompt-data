Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `n` is an integer that defines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the given state**:
   - The variable `ans` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `once` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The `counter` dictionary is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

5. **Formulate the required state**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0) so that the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
