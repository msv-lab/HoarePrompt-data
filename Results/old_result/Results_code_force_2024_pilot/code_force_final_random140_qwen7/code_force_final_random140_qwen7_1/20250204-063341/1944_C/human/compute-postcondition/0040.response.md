Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `ans`. It only indicates that the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
