Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`; `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `counter` is a dictionary with key `n-1` and value 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `counter` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `i`. Initially, `i` is equal to `n-1`, so `counter[n-1]` is set to 1 (since `counter.get(n-1, 0)` returns 0 and then 1 is added). The values of `arr` and the initial state of `counter` (being an empty dictionary) remain unchanged.
