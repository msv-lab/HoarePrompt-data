Output State: **`once` is True, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `arr`**.

Explanation: The line `once = True` sets the variable `once` to `True`. The values of the other variables (`ans`, `counter`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
