Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking input as a string, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, but now `arr` holds the list of integers obtained from the input.
