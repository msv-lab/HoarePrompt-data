Output State: **`once` is False, `ans` is 1, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the context where it was used. All other variables retain their initial states.
