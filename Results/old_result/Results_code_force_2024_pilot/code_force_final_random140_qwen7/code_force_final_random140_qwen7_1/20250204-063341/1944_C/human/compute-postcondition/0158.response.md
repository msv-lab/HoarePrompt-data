Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and either `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` was initially False, in which case `once` becomes True and `i` remains 0, or `counter.get(i, 0)` does not equal 1 or `once` was initially True, in which case there is no change in the state.
