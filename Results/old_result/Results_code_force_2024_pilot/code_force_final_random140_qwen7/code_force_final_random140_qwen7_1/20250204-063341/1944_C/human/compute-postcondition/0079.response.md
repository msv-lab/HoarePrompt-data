Output State: **`once` is False, `ans` is 0, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `once`, `ans`, `counter`, `i`, or `n`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional structure, leaving the other variables unchanged.
