Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `arr` must contain at least one element.
   - `counter[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` exists in `counter`, otherwise it is set to 1.

2. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for i in arr:`. This means that `i` takes on each value from the list `arr` in sequence.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - Since `arr` must contain at least one element, and `i` is taken from `arr`, the next value of `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`.
   - After processing an element `i` from `arr`, `counter[i]` is updated (either incremented or set to 1).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` must be the next element in `arr`.
   - Since `arr` contains at least one element, there will be another element to process unless `arr` is exhausted.

5. **Updated State**:
   - The state of `arr` remains the same because the loop hasn't processed all elements yet.
   - The state of `counter` will change based on the new value of `i`, but since we don't know the exact value of `i` for the next iteration, we can only say that `counter` will be updated accordingly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `arr`, and `arr` still contains at least one element.

**Answer**:
State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `counter[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` exists in `counter`, otherwise it is set to 1, and `i` is the next element in `arr`**.
