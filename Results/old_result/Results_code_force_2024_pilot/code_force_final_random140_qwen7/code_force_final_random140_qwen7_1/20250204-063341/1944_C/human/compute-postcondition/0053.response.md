Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `ans`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since there is no loop or if statement shown in the code, the values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged.
