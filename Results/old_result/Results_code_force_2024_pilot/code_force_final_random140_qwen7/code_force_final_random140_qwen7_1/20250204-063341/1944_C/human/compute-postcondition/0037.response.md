Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `once` is True**.

Explanation: The variable `once` is explicitly set to `True`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `ans` being 0 and the most internal loop or if statement being broken out of is no longer relevant since `once` is now explicitly set to `True`.
