Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `once` is either `True` or `False`.
   - `ans` is either `1` or `2`.
   - `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `n` is the length of `arr`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `3` in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `3`.
   - `n` remains the same (length of `arr`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`once` is either True or False, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `arr`**.
