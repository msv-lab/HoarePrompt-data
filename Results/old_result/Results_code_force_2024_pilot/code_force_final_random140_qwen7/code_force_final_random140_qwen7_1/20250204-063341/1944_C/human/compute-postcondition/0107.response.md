Postcondition: `once` is either True or False, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr`. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` and `once` is False, then `once` becomes True and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `once` remains False and `ans` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
