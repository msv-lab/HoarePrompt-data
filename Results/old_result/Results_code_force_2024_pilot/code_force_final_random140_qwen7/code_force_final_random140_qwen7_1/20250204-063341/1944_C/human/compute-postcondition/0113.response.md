Output State: **`once` is either True or False, `ans` is 3, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `arr`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 3, to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
