Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `counter[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` exists in `counter`, otherwise it is set to 1, and `i` is the next element in `arr`; `counter[i]` is updated to `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`**.

This means that the value of `counter[i]` has been updated based on whether `i` was already a key in `counter`. If `i` was already a key, its value is incremented by 1. If `i` was not a key, it is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
