Output State: **`ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 0, to `ans`. The other variables (`once`, `n`, and the value of `counter.get(i, 0)`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
