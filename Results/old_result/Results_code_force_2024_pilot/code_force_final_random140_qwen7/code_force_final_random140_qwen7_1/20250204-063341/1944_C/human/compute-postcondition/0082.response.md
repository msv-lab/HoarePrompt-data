Output State: **`once` is True, `ans` is 0, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr`, and the frequency of the current element (`arr[i]`) is not 0.**

Explanation: The line `once = True` does not change the value of `once`. It simply reassigns `once` to `True`, which is its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
