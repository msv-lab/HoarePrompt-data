Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

3. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `counter`.
   - If an integer `i` is not present in `counter`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `i` is present exactly once and hasn't been set yet (`once` is `False`), it sets `ans` to `i + 1`.
   - If `i` is present exactly once and `once` is already `True`, it sets `ans` to `i`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Finding MEX**:
   - The logic in the program is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob play optimally.
   - The program does not account for the fact that Alice can strategically pick elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The program only checks for the presence of each number from `0` to `n-1` and does not consider the sequence of moves made by Alice and Bob.

2. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob or their strategic choices.
   - It simply finds the smallest missing number in the count of elements, which does not reflect the optimal play scenario.

### Correctness Evaluation

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and does not simulate the optimal play of both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

**Correctness: **False**
