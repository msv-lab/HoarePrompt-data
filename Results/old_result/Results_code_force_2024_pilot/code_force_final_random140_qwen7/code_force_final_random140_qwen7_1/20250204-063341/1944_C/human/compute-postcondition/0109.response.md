Output State: **`once` is either True or False, `ans` is 3, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `arr`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 3, to the variable `ans`. The values of the other variables (`once`, `counter`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
