Postcondition: `once` is either True or False, `ans` is 3, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `arr`. If the frequency of `i` (which is 3) in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` becomes True and `ans` is set to 4. Otherwise, `once` remains unchanged and `ans` is set to 3.
