Output State: **`once` is True, `ans` is `i + 1`, `counter` reflects the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr`, and the frequency of the current element (`arr[i]`) is not 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns `i + 1` to `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `ans` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
