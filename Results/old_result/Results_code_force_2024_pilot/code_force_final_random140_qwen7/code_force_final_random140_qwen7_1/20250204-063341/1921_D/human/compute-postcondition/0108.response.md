Postcondition: `a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` and `b2` remain unchanged or are decremented by 1, `ans` is increased by either `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])` or `dif2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and `a2` is either decreased by 1 or `a1` is increased by 1.
