Output State: **`ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1 <= a2` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif3` adds the value of `dif3` to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition `a1 <= a2` must still hold true for the loop to execute one more time.
