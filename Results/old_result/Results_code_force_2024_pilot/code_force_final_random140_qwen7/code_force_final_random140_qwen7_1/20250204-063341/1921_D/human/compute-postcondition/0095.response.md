Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2` - 1, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2-1]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2-1])**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. This affects the calculation of `dif2` and `dif4`, which both depend on the value of `b2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their previous definitions.
