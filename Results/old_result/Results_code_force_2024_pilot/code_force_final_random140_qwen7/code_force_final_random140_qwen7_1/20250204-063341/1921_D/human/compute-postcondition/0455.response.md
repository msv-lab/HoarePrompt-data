Postcondition: **`dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `b1` is incremented by 1.**
