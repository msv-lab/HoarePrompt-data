Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding `dif2`, `b2` is decreased by 1, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue, `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`**.

In this output state, the variable `b2` is decreased by 1 due to the execution of `b2 -= 1`. All other conditions and relationships among the variables remain the same as the initial state, except for the updated value of `b2`.
