Output State: **`a2` is decreased by 1, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`**.

The value of `a2` is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `a1` is still less than or equal to the new value of `a2`. The expressions for `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` remain valid as they depend on the values of `a[a1]`, `a[a2]`, `b[b1]`, and `b[b2]`, which have not been altered.
