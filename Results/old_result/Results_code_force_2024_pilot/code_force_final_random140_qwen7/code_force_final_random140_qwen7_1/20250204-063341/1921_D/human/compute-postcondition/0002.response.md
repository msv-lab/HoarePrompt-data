State right before the while loop, the variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
```
while t > 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, it is already ensured that `t` will be greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive**
