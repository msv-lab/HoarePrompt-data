Output State: **`ans` is `dif1`, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif1` adds the value of `dif1` to `ans`. Since `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `ans` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
