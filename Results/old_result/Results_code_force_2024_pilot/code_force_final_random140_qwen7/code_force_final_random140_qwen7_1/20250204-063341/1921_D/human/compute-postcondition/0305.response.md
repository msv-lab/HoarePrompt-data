Output State: **`ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif4`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1 <= a2` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += dif4` updates the value of `ans` by adding `dif4` to it. `dif4` is defined as the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
