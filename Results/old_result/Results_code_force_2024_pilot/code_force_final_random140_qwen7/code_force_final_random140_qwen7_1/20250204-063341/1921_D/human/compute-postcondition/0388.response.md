Output State: **`ans` is 0 + `dif4`, `b2` is `m - 2`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged), and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. Since `a2` was initially `n - 1`, after decrementing, its new value becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
