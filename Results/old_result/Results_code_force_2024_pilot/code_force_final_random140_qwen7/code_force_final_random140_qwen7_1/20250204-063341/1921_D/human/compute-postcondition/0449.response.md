Output State: **`a2` is decreased by 1, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`**.

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` remains valid, and the definitions of `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` stay the same as they depend on the indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`, which only `a2` is modified.
