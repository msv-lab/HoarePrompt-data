Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list from these mapped integers using `list(...)`. The original values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` is created and assigned the list of integers.
