Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is now `ans + dif1`.**

Explanation: The value of `a1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their original conditions or relationships.
