Output State: **`ans` is 0 + dif3, `b2` is `m - 2`, `b1` is 1, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged), and `dif3` is greater than `dif4`.**

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. Initially, `b1` was 0, so after executing this line, `b1` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
