Output State: **`a1` is 0, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`.**

The code `b2 = m - 1` assigns the value of `m - 1` to `b2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
