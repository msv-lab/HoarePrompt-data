Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `dif3` has been updated to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. All other variables (`a1`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
