To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `a1 <= a2`.

Here are the steps to analyze the required adjustments:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `a1 <= a2`.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`.
   - `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is updated based on certain conditions involving `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`.
   - `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed.
   - `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
   - `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.
   - `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`.
   - `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `a1 <= a2` must hold true.
   - Since `a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, the only state that could potentially change to break this condition is `a2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time is `a2`. We need to ensure that `a1` is still less than or equal to `a2` at the start of the next iteration.

**State:**
- `a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`.
- `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged.
- `ans` is updated based on certain conditions involving `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`.
- `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed.
- `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
- `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.
- `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`.
- `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.
- `a2` must be greater than `a1` for the loop to continue.

State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated based on certain conditions involving `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and `a2` must be greater than `a1`.**
