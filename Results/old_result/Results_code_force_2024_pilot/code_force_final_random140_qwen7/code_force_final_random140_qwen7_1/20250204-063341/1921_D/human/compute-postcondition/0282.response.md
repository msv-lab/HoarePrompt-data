Output State: **`ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1 <= a2` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers.**

The code `ans += dif3` updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `dif3` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged, and their conditions and states are still valid as per the initial state.
