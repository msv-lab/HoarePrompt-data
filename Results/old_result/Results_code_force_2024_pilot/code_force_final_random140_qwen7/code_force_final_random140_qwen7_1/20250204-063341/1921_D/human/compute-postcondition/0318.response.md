Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from a new input string split by spaces and converted to integers.
- `a1` and `a2` are indices within the list `a` such that `a1 <= a2`.
- `b1` and `b2` are indices within the list `b` such that `b1 <= b2`.
- `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences calculated during the loop's iterations.
- `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
- `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.
- `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.
- `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4)**
