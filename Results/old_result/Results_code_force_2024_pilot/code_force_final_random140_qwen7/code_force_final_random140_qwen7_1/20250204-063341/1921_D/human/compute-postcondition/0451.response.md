Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif1`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**.

This means that the variable `ans` has been updated by adding `dif1` to its current value. All other variables retain their original conditions and values from the initial state.
