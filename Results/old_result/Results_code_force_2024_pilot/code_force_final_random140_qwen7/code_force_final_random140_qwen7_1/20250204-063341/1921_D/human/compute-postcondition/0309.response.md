Output State: **`ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2` remains unchanged, `dif1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` remains unchanged, `dif3` remains unchanged, `dif4` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `a1` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) remain unchanged. After incrementing `a1`, `dif1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
