The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers \( n \) and \( m \) (with \( 1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and the sum of \( m \) across all test cases not exceeding \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \)) and lists \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) (where \( 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( i \)). For each test case, it sorts the lists \( a \) and \( b \), then iterates through them to find the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the lists \( a \) and \( b \). After processing all test cases, it prints the total sum of these maximum differences. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
