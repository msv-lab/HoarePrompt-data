Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif3`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2-1] - b[b2])`, `a2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decreases the value of `a2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Specifically, `a2` is now `a2 - 1`. The other variables (`ans`, `a1`, `b1`, `dif2`, `dif4`) retain their initial relationships and values as described in the initial state.
