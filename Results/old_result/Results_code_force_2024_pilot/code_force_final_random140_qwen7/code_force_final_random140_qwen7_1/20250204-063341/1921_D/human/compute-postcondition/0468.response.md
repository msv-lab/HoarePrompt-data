Output State: **`ans` is `ans` + `dif2`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif2`. The other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
