Output State: **`ans` is 1, `b2` is `m - 2`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged)**.

Explanation: The value of `b2` is decremented by 1, so `b2` becomes `m - 2`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
