Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`, `a2` is an index within the list `a`, `b1` is an index within the list `b`, `b2` is an index within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences. If `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is increased by `dif3`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif2`. If `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif2`.**
