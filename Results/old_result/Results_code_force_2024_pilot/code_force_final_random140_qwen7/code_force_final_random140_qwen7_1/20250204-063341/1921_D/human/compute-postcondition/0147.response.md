Output State: **`dif3` is equal to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding `dif2`, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue, `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += dif2` adds the value of `dif2` to `ans`. The other variables remain in their initial states or follow the given conditions. Specifically, `dif3` remains unchanged, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue.
