Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]` and assigns it to `dif1`. The initial conditions regarding `ans`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged.
