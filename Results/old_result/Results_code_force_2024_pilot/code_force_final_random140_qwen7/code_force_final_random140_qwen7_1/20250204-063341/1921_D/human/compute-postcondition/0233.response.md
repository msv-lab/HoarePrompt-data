Output State: **`b2` is `m - 2`, `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, all other variables retain their original values or conditions.**

Explanation: The line `b2 -= 1` decrements the value of `b2` by 1. Since `b2` was originally `m - 1`, after decrementing, `b2` becomes `m - 2`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged as no other operations affect them.
