Postcondition: `ans` is the accumulated sum of differences based on the following rules: if `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, then `ans` is set to the maximum of `dif3` and `dif2`, `a1` is adjusted to `a2 - 1` or incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1 if necessary, and `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` are recalculated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif2` or `dif4`, `a1` is incremented by 1 or decremented by 1, and `dif2` is updated to `b[b2] - 1` or `b[b2 - 1]` accordingly.
