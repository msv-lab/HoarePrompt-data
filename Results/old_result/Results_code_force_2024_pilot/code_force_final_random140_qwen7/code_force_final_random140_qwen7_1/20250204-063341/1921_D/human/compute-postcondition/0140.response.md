Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1 to become `a1 + 1`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1 + 1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1 + 1` for the loop to continue.**

This means that `b1` has been incremented by 1, while all other conditions and relationships remain the same as before the code execution.
