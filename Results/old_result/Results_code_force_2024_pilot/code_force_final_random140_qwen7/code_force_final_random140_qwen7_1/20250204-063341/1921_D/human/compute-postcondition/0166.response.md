Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int type using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list from the map object using `list(...)`. The resulting list is stored in the variable `a`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
