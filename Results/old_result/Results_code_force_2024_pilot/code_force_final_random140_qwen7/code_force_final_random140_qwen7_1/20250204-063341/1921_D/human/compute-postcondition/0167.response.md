Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each of those strings into integers, and stores them in the list `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
