Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1 and is now either equal to `a2` or less than `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

This means that `a1` has been incremented by 1, and it is now either equal to `a2` or still less than `a2`. The values of `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as calculated previously based on their respective formulas.
