Output State: **`ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decreased by 1, but the exact value of `a2` before the operation is not specified. The other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `a1 <= a2` must still hold true for the loop to execute one more time.
