Output State: **`b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b2` is within the range of list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences calculated during the loop's iterations, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**.

In this case, the code simply assigns the value 0 to `b1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
