Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `dif3` to be the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. The other variables (`ans`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
