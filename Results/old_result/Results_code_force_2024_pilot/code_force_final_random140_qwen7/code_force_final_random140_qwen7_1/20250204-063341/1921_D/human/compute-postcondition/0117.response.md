Postcondition: `a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by either `dif4` or `dif2` depending on the condition, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2]), and `b2` is decreased by 1.
