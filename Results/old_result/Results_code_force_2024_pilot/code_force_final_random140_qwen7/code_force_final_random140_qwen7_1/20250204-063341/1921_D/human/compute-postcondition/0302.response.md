Output State: **`ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2` remains unchanged, `dif1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, `dif2` remains unchanged, `dif3` remains unchanged, `dif4` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decreases the value of `b2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
