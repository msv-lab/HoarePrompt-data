Output State: **`a1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is 0, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` (`a[0]`) and the last element of list `b` (`b[m - 1]`). This value is assigned to `dif2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b2` is updated to `m - 1`.
