Output State: **`a1` is 0, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` and `a2` are indices within the list `a` such that `a1` <= `a2`, `b1` and `b2` are indices within the list `b` such that `b1` <= `b2`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences calculated during the loop's iterations, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `b` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The line `a1 = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to `a1`. No other variables are affected, and the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as they were in the initial state.
