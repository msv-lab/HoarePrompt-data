Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `b1` is 1 or 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is either `dif3` or `dif1`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`.** 

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `dif3 > dif1`, then `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, and `ans` is `dif3`. Otherwise, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, and `ans` is `dif1`.
