Output State: **`a1` is 0, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a2 = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to `a2`. The values of `a1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
