Output State: **`ans` is `dif3`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` - 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`**.

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a2` is now one less than its original value, while `a1` is still less than or equal to the new value of `a2`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` are not affected by this operation.
