Output State: **`ans` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`, list `a` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code updates `dif1` to be the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. Given the initial conditions, `b1` is 0, so `dif1` becomes the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
