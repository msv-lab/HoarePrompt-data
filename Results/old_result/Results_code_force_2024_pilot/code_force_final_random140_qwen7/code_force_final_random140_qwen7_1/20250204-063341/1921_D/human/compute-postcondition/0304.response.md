Postcondition: `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, `a1` and `a2` are indices within the list `a`, `b1` and `b2` are indices within the list `b`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
