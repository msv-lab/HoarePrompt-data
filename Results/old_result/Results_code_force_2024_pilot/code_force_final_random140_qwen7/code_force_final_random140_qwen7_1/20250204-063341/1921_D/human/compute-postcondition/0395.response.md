Postcondition: `ans` is either `0 + dif4` or `1`, `b2` is either `m - 3` or `m - 2`, `b1` is `0`, `a1` is within the range of list `a` and can be `a1 + 1` if the else part is executed, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged), and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `ans` will be either `0 + dif4` if the if condition is true, or `1` if the else condition is true. The values of `b2` and `a1` may change depending on which branch of the if-else is taken, while other variables remain unchanged or follow specific conditions as mentioned.
