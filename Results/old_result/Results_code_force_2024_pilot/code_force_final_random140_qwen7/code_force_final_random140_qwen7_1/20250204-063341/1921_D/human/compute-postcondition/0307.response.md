Output State: **`a2` is decreased by 1; `b2` is decreased by 1; `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif4`, where `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `a1 <= a2` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `b2` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous relationships and values. Specifically, `ans` includes the updated `dif4`, which is now the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and the new `b[b2]`. The conditions and relationships involving `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged.
