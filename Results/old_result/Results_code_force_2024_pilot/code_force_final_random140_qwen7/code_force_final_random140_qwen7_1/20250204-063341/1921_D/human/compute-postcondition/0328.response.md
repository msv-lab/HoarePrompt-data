Output State: **`ans` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` sets the value of `ans` to 0. All other variables retain their previous values as no operations were performed on them in the given code snippet.
