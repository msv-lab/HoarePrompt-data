Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers; `a1` is 0.**

The code initializes `a1` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
