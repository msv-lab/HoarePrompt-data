Postcondition: `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, and `ans` is updated as follows:
- If `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `b1` is incremented by 1.
- If `dif3` is not greater than `dif1`, and `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, and `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` are updated accordingly.
- Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly.
