Output State: **`a1` is 0, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `ans` being explicitly set to 0.
