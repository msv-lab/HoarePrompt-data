Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`, `a2` is an index within the list `a`, `b1` is an index within the list `b`, `b2` is an index within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif1 > dif2` and `dif3 > dif4`, then either `b1` is increased by 1 and `ans` is updated accordingly, or `a1` and `b1` are increased by 1 and `ans` is updated accordingly. If `dif1 > dif2` and `dif4 > dif1`, then either `b2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is updated accordingly, or `a1` is increased by 1 and `ans` is updated accordingly. If `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is increased by `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. If `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, and `dif3` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1.
