Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop.
- `b2` is set to `m - 3`.
- `b1` is set to `2` if `dif3 > dif4` was chosen in the last iteration.
- `a1` is incremented by `3` after executing the loop `3` times.
- `a2` is set to `n - 3`.
- `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
- `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.
- `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.
- `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. However, we know that `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration.

Given the structure of the problem, `ans` will be the sum of these maximum differences. Since the exact values are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the maximum differences found during the iterations.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop)**
