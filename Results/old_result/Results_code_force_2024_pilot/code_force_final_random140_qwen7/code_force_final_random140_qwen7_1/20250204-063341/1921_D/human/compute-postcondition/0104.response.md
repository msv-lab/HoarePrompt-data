Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is decreased by 1.**

This means that `b1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their relationships and values from the initial state, except for the updated values due to the increment of `b1`.
