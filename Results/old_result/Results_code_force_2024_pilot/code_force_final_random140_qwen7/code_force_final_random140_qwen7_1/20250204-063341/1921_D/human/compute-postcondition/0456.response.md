Output State: **`ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif4` increments the value of `ans` by `dif4`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
