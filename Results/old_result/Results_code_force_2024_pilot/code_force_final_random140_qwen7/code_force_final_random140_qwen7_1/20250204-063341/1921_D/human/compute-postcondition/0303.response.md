Postcondition: `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, either plus `dif3` (if `dif3 > dif2`) or plus `dif2` (if `dif3 <= dif2`). `a1` and `a2` are adjusted accordingly (either `a2` is decreased by 1 or `a1` is increased by 1), and other differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) are updated based on the chosen path.
