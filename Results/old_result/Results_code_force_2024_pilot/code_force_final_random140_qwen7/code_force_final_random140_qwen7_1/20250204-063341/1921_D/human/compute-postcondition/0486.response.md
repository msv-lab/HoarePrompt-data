Output State: `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences found during each iteration of the loop, `b2` is `m - 3`, `b1` is `2` (if `dif3 > dif4` was chosen in the last iteration), `a1` is `a1 + 3` (since we executed the loop 3 times), `a2` is `n - 3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the sum of the maximum differences found between elements of lists `a` and `b` as per the conditions specified in the loop. The indices `b1` and `b2` will have been adjusted according to the decisions made during the iterations, with `b2` being reduced by 1 for each iteration, and `b1` being incremented when appropriate. The values of `a1` and `a2` will also have been adjusted to reflect the number of iterations completed.
