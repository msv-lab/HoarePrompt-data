Postcondition: `dif3` is equal to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated based on certain conditions involving `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue, `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `a2` becomes one less than its original value, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `dif3` to its current value, and `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1 to `a1 + 1`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1 + 1]` and `b[b2]`, and `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.
