Postcondition: **`dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif4 > dif1`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, and `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly.**
