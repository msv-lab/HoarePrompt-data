Postcondition: `ans` is the accumulated result based on the following rules: if `dif3` is greater than `dif2`, then `ans` is set to the maximum of `dif3` and `dif4`, `a1` is adjusted to either `a2 - 1` or `a1 + 1` depending on the comparison, `b1` is adjusted to either `b1 + 1` or `b2`, and `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by the minimum of `dif2` and `dif4`, `a1` is adjusted to either `a1 + 1` or `a2`, and `dif2` is updated to either `b[b2] - 1` or `b[b2 - 1]` accordingly.
