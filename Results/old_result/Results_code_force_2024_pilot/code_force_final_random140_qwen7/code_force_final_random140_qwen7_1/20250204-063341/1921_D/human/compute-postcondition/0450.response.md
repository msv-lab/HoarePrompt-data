Output State: **`a2` is decreased by 1, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`**.

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. This affects the calculation of `dif1`, which was originally the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. Now, `dif1` becomes the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
