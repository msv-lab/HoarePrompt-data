Output State: **`a2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif4`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1 <= a2` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`.**

This means that `a2` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous states. The condition `a1 <= a2` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing, and the values of `ans`, `dif4`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
