Output State: **`a1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 3`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is `dif4`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, and `dif4` is greater than `dif2`.**

Explanation: The code `b2 -= 1` decreases the value of `b2` by 1. Since `b2` was initially `m - 2`, after executing this line, `b2` becomes `m - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
