Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding `dif2`, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue, `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`**.

This means that `a1` has been incremented by 1, while all other conditions and relationships remain the same. The value of `a1` is now one more than its previous value, but it still needs to be less than or equal to `a2`. The other variables and their relationships are unchanged from the initial state.
