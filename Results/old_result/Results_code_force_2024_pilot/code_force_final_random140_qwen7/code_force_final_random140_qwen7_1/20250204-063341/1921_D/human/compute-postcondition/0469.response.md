Output State: **`ans` is `ans` + `dif2`, `a1` is `a1` + 1, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`**.

In this case, the code `a1 += 1` increments the value of `a1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `a1` is updated to its original value plus one, while the conditions and relationships involving `a1` and the differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`) remain as they were.
