Output State: **`ans` is `ans + dif1`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif1` adds the value of `dif1` to `ans`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
