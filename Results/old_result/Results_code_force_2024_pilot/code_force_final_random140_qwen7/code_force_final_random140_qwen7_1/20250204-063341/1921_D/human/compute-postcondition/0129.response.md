Output State: **`a2` is decreased by 1, `a2` is now one less than its original value, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `dif3` to its current value, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue, `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`**.

Explanation: The code `b1 += 1` increases the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `b1` being increased by 1 while keeping the rest of the conditions and values as they were initially described.
