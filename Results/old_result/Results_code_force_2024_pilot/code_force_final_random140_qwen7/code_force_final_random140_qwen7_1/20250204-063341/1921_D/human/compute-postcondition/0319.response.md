The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, m is an input integer, a is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, b is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, a1 and a2 are indices within the list a such that a1 <= a2, b1 and b2 are indices within the list b such that b1 <= b2, ans is the sum of certain absolute differences calculated during the loop's iterations, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].**
