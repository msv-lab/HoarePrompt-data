Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a1` is 0, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a1`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated according to the following rules:
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding either `dif3` (if `dif3 > dif1` is true) or `dif1`, or by increasing `ans` by the maximum of `dif4` and `dif1`. Alternatively, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed. `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, and `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `dif3`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `ans` are updated based on the following conditions: if `dif1 > dif2`, then `dif3` is used to update `ans`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, and `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2-1] - b[b2])`. Otherwise, `dif3` is equal to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `a1` is increased by 1, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding `dif2`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
