Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1 and remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

This means that `a1` has been incremented by 1, while `b1` and `a2` remain unchanged from their previous values. The value of `ans` is increased by the previous value of `dif2`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the new value of `a1` and the unchanged values of `b1`, `b2`, `a2`, and the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.
