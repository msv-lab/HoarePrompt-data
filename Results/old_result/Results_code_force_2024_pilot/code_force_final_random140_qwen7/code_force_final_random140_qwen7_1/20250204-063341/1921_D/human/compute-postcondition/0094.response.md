Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2` - 1, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. Since `a1` must remain less than or equal to `a2`, `a1` will also need to be adjusted accordingly to maintain this condition. However, since no specific value for `a1` was given, we keep the condition as is. All other variables (`b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) remain unchanged.
