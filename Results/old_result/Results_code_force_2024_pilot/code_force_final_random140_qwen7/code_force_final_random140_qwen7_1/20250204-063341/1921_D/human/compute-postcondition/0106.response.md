Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1 and remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

This means that `a1` has been incremented by 1, while `b1` and `a2` remain unchanged from their previous values. The value of `ans` is increased by `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the new value of `a[a1]` (which is `a[a1+1]` after incrementing) and `b[b2]`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the updated position of `a1` and the current values of `b1`, `b2`, `a2`, and `b[b1]`.
