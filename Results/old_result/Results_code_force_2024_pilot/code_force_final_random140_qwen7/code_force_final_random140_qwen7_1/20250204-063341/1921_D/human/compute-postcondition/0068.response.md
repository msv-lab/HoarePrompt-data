Output State: **`a1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is `dif4`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, and `dif4` is greater than `dif2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif4` increments the value of `ans` by `dif4`. Since `dif4` is defined as the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[m - 1]`, and it was previously stated that `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, the updated value of `ans` is now `dif4`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
