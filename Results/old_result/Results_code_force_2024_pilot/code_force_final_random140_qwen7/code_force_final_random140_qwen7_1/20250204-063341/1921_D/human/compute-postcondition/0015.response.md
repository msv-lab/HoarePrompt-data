Output State: **`a1` is 0, `b1` is 0, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

This output state reflects that `a1` and `b1` remain unchanged at 0, `dif1` is now the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`, and all other variables retain their initial conditions or values.
