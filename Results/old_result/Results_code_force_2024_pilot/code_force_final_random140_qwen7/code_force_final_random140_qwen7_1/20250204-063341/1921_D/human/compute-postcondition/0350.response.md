Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `b2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 1`, `b1` is 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be incremented by 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 2]` or `b[m - 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 2]` or `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 2]` or `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]`, and the condition `dif3 <= dif1` holds true if the else part is executed, otherwise `dif3 > dif1` holds true.
