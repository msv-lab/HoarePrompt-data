Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` remains unchanged, and `dif4` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `dif2` to be the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`. All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
