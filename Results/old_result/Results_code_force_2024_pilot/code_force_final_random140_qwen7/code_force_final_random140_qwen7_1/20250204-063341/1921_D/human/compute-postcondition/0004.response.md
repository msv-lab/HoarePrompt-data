Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive.
