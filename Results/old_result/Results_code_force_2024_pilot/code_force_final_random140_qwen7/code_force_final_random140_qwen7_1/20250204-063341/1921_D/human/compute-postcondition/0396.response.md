Postcondition: **`ans` is either 0 + `dif4` or 1, `b2` is either `m - 3` or `m - 2`, `b1` is always 0, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and `a1 + 1`, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `b` is always sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[0]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[m - 1]` (unchanged), `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]` (unchanged), `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[n - 1]` and `b[b2]` (unchanged), and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`**.
