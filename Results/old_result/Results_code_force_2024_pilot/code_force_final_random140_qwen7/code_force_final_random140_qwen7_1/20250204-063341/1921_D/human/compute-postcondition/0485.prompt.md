Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `b1` is 0, `a1` is within the range of list `a`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b` is sorted, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, list `a` is sorted.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, then `ans` is 1, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, and the condition `dif3 <= dif4` remains true. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 + `dif3` or 0 + `dif4` or 1, `b2` is either `m - 2`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 1 or 0 or 0, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and equals `a1 + 1` or remains the same or `a1 + 1`, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`. `b` remains sorted throughout the process.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, then:
- If `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is updated by adding `dif3`, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` is now `a2 - 1`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif4 > dif1`, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, `b2` is either `m - 4`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is either within the range of list `a` and could be `a1 + 1`, `a2` is now `a2 - 1`, `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif4 <= dif1`, `b1` is 2, `b2` is either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`, `ans` is now `ans + dif1`.
- If `dif3` is not greater than `dif4`, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4` to its current value, `b2` is either `m - 4`, `m - 3`, or `m - 2`, `b1` is either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`, and `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.

In simpler terms, `ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4` under different conditions involving `dif1` and `dif2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, and `ans` is updated according to the following rules:


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
