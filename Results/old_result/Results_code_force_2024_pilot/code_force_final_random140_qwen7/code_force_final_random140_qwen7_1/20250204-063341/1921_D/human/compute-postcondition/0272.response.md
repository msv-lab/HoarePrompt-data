Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` and `a2` are indices within the list `a`, `b1` and `b2` are indices within the list `b`. `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences. If `dif4 > dif2`, then `ans` includes `dif4`; otherwise, `ans` includes `dif2`. `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.
