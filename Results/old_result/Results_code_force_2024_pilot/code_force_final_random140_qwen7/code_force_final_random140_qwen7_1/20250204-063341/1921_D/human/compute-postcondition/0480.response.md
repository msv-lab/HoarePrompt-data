Postcondition: `ans` is the accumulated sum of differences, `a1` and `a2` are adjusted based on the condition, and `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` are updated accordingly. If `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, then `ans` is incremented by `dif4`, `a2` is decremented by 1, and `dif2` is updated to `b[b2 - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif2`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `dif2` is updated to `b[b2] - 1`.
