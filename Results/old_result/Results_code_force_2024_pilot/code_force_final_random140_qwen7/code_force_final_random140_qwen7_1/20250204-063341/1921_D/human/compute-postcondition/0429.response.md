Postcondition: `ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif2`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif3`, `b2` remains as either `m - 3`, `m - 2`, or `m - 1`, `b1` is 1, `a1` could be `a1 + 1`, and `a2` becomes `a2 - 1`. If `dif3` is not greater than `dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `b2` changes to `m - 4`, `b1` remains as either 0, 1, or 1, `a1` becomes `a1 + 1`, and `a2` must be greater than or equal to `a1`.
