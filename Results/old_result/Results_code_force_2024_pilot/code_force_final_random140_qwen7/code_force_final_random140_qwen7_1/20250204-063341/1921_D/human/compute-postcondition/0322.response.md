Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` and `a2` are indices within the list `a` such that `a1` <= `a2`, `b1` and `b2` are indices within the list `b` such that `b1` <= `b2`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences calculated during the loop's iterations, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

This output state reflects that the list `a` has been updated to a new list of integers obtained from the user input, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state except for `a`.
