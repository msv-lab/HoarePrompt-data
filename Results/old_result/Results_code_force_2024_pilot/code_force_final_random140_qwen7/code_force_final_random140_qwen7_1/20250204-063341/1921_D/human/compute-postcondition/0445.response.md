Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif4`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]` and assigns it to `dif2`. The values of `ans`, `a1`, `a2`, `dif1`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
