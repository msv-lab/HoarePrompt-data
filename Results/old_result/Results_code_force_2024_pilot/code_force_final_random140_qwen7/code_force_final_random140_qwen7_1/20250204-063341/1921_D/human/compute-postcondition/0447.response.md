Output State: **`dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `dif4` to be the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
