Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive**.

Explanation: Initially, `t` is assigned the value of an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Therefore, `t` now holds a value that is one less than its original value, making it an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive.
