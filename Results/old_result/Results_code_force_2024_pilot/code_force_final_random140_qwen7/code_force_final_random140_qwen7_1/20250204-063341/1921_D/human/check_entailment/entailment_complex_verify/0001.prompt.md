You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers \( n \) and \( m \) (with \( 1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and the sum of \( m \) across all test cases not exceeding \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \)) and lists \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) (where \( 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( i \)). For each test case, it sorts the lists \( a \) and \( b \), then iterates through them to find the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the lists \( a \) and \( b \). After processing all test cases, it prints the total sum of these maximum differences. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: The code sorts both arrays `a` and `b`. Sorting helps in efficiently finding the maximum differences between corresponding elements.

3. **Two Pointers Technique**: The code uses a two-pointer technique to compare elements from the sorted arrays `a` and `b`. It maintains pointers `a1` and `a2` for array `a` and `b1` and `b2` for array `b`.

4. **Difference Calculation**: For each pair of elements from `a` and `b`, the code calculates four possible differences:
   - `dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`
   - `dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`
   - `dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`
   - `dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`

5. **Max Difference Selection**: The code selects the maximum of these four differences and adds it to the answer. It then adjusts the pointers based on which difference was selected.

6. **Pointer Adjustment**: Depending on which difference was the largest, the code either increments or decrements the appropriate pointer to move towards the next pair of elements.

7. **Output**: After processing all pairs, the code prints the total difference `ans`.

Given the logic and the approach used, the code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. It handles the sorting and the two-pointer technique appropriately to maximize the total difference.
