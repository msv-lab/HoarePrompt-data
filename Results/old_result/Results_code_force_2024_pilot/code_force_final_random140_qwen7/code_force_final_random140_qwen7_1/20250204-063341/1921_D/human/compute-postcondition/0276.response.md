Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the new input string split by spaces and converted to integers, `a1` is an index within the list `a`, `a2` is an index within the list `a`, `b1` is an index within the list `b`, `b2` is an index within the list `b`, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences, where if `dif1 > dif2`, then `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif1` and either `a1` is incremented by 1 or `b2` is the index within the list `b` decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`; otherwise, if `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif3` and `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`; otherwise, `ans` is the sum of certain absolute differences plus `dif2` and `ans` is updated by adding `dif2`.**
