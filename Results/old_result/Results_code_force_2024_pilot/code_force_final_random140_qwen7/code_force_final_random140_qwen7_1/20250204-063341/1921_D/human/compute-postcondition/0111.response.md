Output State: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2` - 1, `b1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2])**.

Explanation: The code `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. This affects the condition that `a1` should remain less than or equal to `a2`. All other variables (`b1`, `ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their relationships and values remain the same as before the decrement.
