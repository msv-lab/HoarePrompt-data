Postcondition: **`a1` is updated such that it remains less than or equal to `a2` and greater than or equal to 0, `b1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `dif4` and `dif1`, `dif1` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is abs(a[a2] - b[b1]), `dif4` is abs(a[a2] - b[b2]).**
