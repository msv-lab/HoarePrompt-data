You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_i and b_i are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.

        #State: Output State: The loop will terminate when `t` becomes 0. At this point, `t` will be 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the maximum differences found between corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `b` over all iterations. The indices `a1` and `a2` will satisfy `a1 > a2`, and `b1` and `b2` will be adjusted based on the comparisons made during the loop. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` will be the absolute differences calculated during the last iteration of the loop.
        #
        #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain the total sum of the maximum differences found between elements of lists `a` and `b` as per the conditions specified in the loop. The indices `a1` and `a2` will no longer be valid for further comparisons since `a1` will be greater than `a2`. The values of `b1` and `b2` will reflect the last adjustments made during the loop, and `t` will be 0, indicating the end of the loop.
    #State: `t` will be 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers n and m (with 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and the sum of m across all test cases not exceeding 2 ⋅ 10^5) and lists a_i and b_i (where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
