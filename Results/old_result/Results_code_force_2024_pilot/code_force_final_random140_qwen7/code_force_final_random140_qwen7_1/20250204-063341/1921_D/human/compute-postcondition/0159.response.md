Postcondition: **`dif3`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `ans` are updated based on the following conditions: if `dif1 > dif2`, then `dif3` is used to update `ans`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is increased by 1, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, and `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2-1] - b[b2])`. Otherwise, `dif3` is equal to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `a1` is increased by 1, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated by adding `dif2`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**
