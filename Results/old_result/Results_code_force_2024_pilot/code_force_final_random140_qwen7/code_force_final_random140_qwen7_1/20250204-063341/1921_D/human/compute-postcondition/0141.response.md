Postcondition: `dif3` is equal to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is updated based on the conditions involving `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `b2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a2` is greater than `a1` for the loop to continue, `dif3` is equal to `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, and `ans` is updated accordingly whether `dif4` is greater than `dif1` or not. If `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, `b2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `dif4`, and `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1 + 1]` and `b[b2]`.
