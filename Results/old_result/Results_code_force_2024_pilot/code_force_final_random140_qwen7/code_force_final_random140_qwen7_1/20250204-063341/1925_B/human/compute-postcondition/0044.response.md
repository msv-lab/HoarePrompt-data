Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`. The variable `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). The variable `x` remains the same as the initial input. The variable `n` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`. The variable `i` will be the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` and also less than or equal to `k`. If no such divisor exists, `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

In simpler terms, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and the loop will iterate up to the square root of `x` plus one, checking each potential divisor.
