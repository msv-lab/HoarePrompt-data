Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 5, `l` is `[ans]`**.

Explanation: The code `l = [ans]` updates the list `l` to contain only the element `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
