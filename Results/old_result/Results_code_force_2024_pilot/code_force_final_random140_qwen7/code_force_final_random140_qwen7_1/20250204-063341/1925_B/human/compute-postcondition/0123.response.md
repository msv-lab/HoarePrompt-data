Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `l` is [1, 2, 1]
   - The condition for the loop is that `x` must be divisible by `i`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3 (because the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must be divisible by the new value of `i`, which is 3.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `x` must remain such that it is divisible by 3 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated states at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is 2, `i` is 3, `l` is [1, 2, 1], `x` must be divisible by 3**
