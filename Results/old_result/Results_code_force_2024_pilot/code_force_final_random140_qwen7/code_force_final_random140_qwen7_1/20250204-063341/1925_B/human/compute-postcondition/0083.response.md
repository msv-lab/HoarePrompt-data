Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, and `l` is `[ans, i]; l.append(x // i)` appends `x // i` to the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` is still `i_prev + 2`, `ans` is still the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, and `l` is now `[ans, i]` with an additional element `x // i` appended to it.
