Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the values [ans, 4, x // 4].

This postcondition states that after the execution of the if-else block, `ans` remains as the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` remains a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 4, and `l` is a list containing the values [ans, 4, x // 4].
