Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which gives the minimum possible difficulty per sub-problem if the difficulties were evenly distributed.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which will store the maximum GCD found.

3. **Loop Through Possible Divisors**:
   - The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` (inclusive).
   - For each number `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and adds it to `l` if true.
     - It also checks if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and adds it to `l` if true.
     - It updates `ans` to be the maximum value in `l`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all divisors, it prints `ans`.

### Correctness Check

To ensure the program is correct, let's verify the logic:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program aims to find the maximum GCD of `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x`.
   - The approach is to check all divisors of `x` and see if they can form `n` sub-problems with the required properties.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is prime and `n > 1`, the only possible GCD is 1 because no other divisor can divide `x` evenly into `n` parts.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, the GCD will be 1.
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, the GCD can be higher, but the program correctly identifies the highest possible GCD by checking all divisors.

3. **Optimality**:
   - The program correctly identifies the highest possible GCD by considering all divisors of `x` and ensuring the sum of the sub-problems equals `x`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. It considers all possible divisors and ensures the sum constraint is met.

**Correctness: True**
