Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the values [ans, 4, x // 4]. If `x // i` (which is `x // 4`) is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` includes `x // 4`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.
