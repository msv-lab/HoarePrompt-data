Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, `l` is `[ans]`**.

Explanation: The code `l = [ans]` updates the list `l` to contain only the element `ans`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `x // (i_prev + 2)` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for updating `l` based on `x // (i_prev + 2)` and `k` is not relevant here since the list assignment directly sets `l` to `[ans]`.
