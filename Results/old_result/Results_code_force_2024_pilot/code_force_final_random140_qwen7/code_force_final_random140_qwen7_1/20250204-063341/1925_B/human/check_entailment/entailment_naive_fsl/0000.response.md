Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1. In such a case, the GCD of the difficulties would be 1, but the program might return a value greater than 1. For example, consider the input:

```
1
7 3
```

The correct output should be 1 because the maximum balance can be achieved by breaking the problem into difficulties 2, 2, and 3, which have a GCD of 1. However, the program might return a value greater than 1, as it does not ensure that the GCD is maximized correctly in all cases.
