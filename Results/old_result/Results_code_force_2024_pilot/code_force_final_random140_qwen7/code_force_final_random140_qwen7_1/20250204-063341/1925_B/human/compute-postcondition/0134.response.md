Output State: **ans is 3, i is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to int(x) / n, and l is [2, 3, 1].**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will be the maximum value found among the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x) / n`. From the given information, we can infer that the loop iterates up to the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition, and updates `ans` to 3 when it finds such a divisor. The value of `i` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x) / n`, and the list `l` will always contain `[2, 3, 1]` because `ans` is set to 3 and the other elements are fixed based on the conditions provided.
