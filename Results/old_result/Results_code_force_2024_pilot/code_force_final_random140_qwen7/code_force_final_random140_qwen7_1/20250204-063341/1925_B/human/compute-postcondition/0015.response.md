Output State: **`ans` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and the value of `x // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after the operation `i` becomes 3 (since the loop condition `i <= k` is checked again and `i` is incremented). The value of `x // i` is calculated using the current value of `i`, which is 3. Therefore, `l` now contains the values 1, 2, and `x // 2`.
