Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`.
   - `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `i_prev + 2`.
   - We need to check if the new value of `i` is within the range of the loop, i.e., `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
   - The values of `ans` and `l` remain unchanged unless the loop body updates them.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
- `ans` and `l` will remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, and `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `i_prev + 2`, and `x // (i_prev + 2)` if `x // (i_prev + 2)` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.**
