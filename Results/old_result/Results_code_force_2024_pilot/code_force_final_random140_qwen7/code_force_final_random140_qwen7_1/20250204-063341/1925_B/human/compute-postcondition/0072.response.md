Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`, and `x // i` is appended to the list `l`.**

This means that the value of `i` has been updated to `i_prev + 1`, `ans` has been updated to the maximum value among its previous value, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, and `l` now contains `ans` and `i`. Additionally, the value of `x // i` has been appended to the list `l`.
