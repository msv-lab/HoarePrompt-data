Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to int(x), and `x % i` equals 0; `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`; the current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the list `l` now contains two elements: the original element `ans` and the new element `i`. The conditions for `i` and its relation to `x` and `k` remain unchanged.
