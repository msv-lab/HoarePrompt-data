Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

3. **Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `ans` is initially `1`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is the initial input.
   - `n` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`.
   - `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`.
   - `i` is the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to int(`x`) / `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop condition depends on the value of `i`. Specifically, `i` should be within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
   - Since `i` is the loop variable, we need to ensure that `i` starts within this range.

Given the initial conditions and the loop range, we need to ensure that `i` is set to a value that falls within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

Since `i` is the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to int(`x`) / `n`, and considering the range of the loop, we need to ensure that `i` is set to a value that satisfies the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `i` must be within the range 1 to int(x ** 0.5) + 2.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` must be within the range 1 to int(x ** 0.5) + 2**
