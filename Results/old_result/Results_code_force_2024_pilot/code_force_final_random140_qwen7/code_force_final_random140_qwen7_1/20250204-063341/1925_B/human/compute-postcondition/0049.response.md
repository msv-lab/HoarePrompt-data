Output State: **`ans` is 1, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` remains the same as the initial input, `n` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, and `i` is the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to int(`x`) / `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `ans`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
