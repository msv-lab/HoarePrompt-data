Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the maximum value among all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`. The variable `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` remains a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`. The variable `i` will be the last divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition `x % i == 0` and is less than or equal to `x ** 0.5`. If no such divisor exists, `i` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `x ** 0.5`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will hold the greatest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and does not exceed the square root of `x`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`) retain their initial values from the input, and `i` will be the largest such divisor or the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x` if no valid divisor was found.
