Output State: **`ans` is 2, `i` is 3, `l` is [2, 3], `x` must be divisible by 3**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `l`. Initially, `l` is `[2]`. After appending `i`, `l` becomes `[2, 3]`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `x` must be divisible by 3 is still valid.
