Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x) / n`, and the final value of `i` will be the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x) / n`.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will contain the largest value from the list of divisors of `x` that satisfy the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, these conditions are that the divisor `i` must be less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` must also be less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` will hold the last divisor of `x` that meets these criteria. If no such divisors exist, `ans` will retain its initial value of 1, and `i` will be set to the last divisor checked during the loop's execution.
