Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in the list [1, 2, x // 2], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, `i` is 5, `l` is `[ans, 5]`**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 5) to the list `l`. Initially, `l` is `[ans]`. After appending `i`, `l` becomes `[ans, 5]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
