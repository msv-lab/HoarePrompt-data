Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, and the expressions inside the `range` function, which involve `x` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. This means `i` will take values starting from `1` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `ans` is `1`.
   - `i` will be the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x) / n`.
   - `k` is `x // n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - **`i`**: The value of `i` is determined by the loop condition and the initial value of `i` before the loop starts. Since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is within this range.
   - **`x` and `n`**: These are used to determine the upper limit of the loop (`int(x ** 0.5) + 1`). Therefore, they need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range and that `x` and `n` are set such that the loop can start executing.

**State after adjustment**:
- `ans` remains `1`.
- `i` should be set to `1` (the starting point of the loop).
- `x` and `n` should be such that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is a valid upper limit for the loop.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` and `n` are such that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is a valid upper limit for the loop**.
