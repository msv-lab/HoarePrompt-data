Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be such that `i` equals `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`, and `l` is a list containing the final value of `ans` and the last divisor `i` that was considered during the loop's execution.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the largest possible value within the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. The variable `ans` will hold the highest value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`. The list `l` will contain `ans` and the last divisor `i` that satisfied the conditions inside the loop.
