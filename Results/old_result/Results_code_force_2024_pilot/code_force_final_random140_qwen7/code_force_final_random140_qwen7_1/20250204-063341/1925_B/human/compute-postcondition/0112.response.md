Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is 1
   - `i` is either 2 or remains 1
   - `l` is [1, 1]

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is set to the maximum value of the list `l`.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

5. **Determine the next possible value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will increment to 2 in the next iteration.
   - If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will increment to 3 in the next iteration.

6. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - For `i = 2`, the loop will continue if `i` is still within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
   - For `i = 3`, the loop will continue if `3` is still within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

7. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
   - If `i` was 2, it will become 3.
   - `ans` remains 1 unless `x % i == 0` and `l`'s maximum value is greater than 1.
   - `l` remains [1, 1] unless the loop updates it.

Given the current state and the loop condition, let's consider both possibilities:

- **If `i` was 1**: 
  - `i` becomes 2.
  - `ans` remains 1 (since no update occurred).
  - `l` remains [1, 1].

- **If `i` was 2**: 
  - `i` becomes 3.
  - `ans` remains 1 (since no update occurred).
  - `l` remains [1, 1].

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `x`, we cannot determine if `i` will remain 1 or become 2. However, based on the general logic, the most straightforward adjustment is to assume the next possible value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `l` is [1, 1]**
