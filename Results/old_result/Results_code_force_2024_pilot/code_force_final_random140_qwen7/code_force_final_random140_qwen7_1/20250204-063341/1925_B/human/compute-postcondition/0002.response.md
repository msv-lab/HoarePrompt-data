Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is the first integer entered by the user, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`.**

Explanation: The code `k = x // n` calculates the integer division of `x` by `n`, which means `k` will hold the quotient without the remainder. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
