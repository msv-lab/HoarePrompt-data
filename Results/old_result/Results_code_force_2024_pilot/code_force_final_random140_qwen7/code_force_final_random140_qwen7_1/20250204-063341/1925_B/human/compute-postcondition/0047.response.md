Output State: **`ans` will be the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` remains the same as the initial input, `n` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `n`, and `i` is the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x) / n`.**

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, assigns the first integer to `x` and the second integer to `n`. The values of `ans`, `t`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `i` is not explicitly defined before or after this line, but it is mentioned that `i` will be the last divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `int(x) / n`.
