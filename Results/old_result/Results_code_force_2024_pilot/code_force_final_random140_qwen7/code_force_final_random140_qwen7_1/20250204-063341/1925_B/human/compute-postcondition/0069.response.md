Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `ans` is set to the maximum value among `ans`, `i_prev + 1`, and `x // (i_prev + 1)`, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains the element `ans`. After executing `l.append(i)`, the list `l` now contains both `ans` and `i`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states, and `l` is updated to include the new value of `i`.
