Based on the initial state provided, the value of `ans` will be the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x) / n`, and `i` will hold the last such divisor. Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not given, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` satisfying the condition, and `i` will be the last such divisor.

Output: **ans (the maximum divisor of x that is <= int(x) / n), i (the last such divisor)**
