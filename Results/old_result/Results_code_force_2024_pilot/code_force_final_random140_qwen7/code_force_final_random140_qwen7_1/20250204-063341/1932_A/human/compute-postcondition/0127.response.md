Output State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no such loop or if statement is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or if statement context. The values of `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn` remain unchanged.
