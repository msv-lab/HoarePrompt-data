Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is always '.', indicating that the path starts with an empty cell.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn = 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters with all characters processed, `ret` is 0, and the variable `thorn` is determined by the sequence of characters in `s` according to the rules specified in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final output state will depend on the contents of the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 2 if any character in `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 2 if any character in `s` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0, and `i` is the last character processed in the list `s`, and the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
