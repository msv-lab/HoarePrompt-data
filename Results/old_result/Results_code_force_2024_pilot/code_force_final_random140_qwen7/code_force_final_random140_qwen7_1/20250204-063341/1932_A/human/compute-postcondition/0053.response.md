Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the string `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `thorn` is 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on the string `s`, we need to ensure that `s` is not empty. Additionally, the variable `i` will be set to the first character of `s` when the loop starts.

5. **Formulate the New State**: Based on the above points, the state should reflect that `s` must have at least one character, and `i` will be set to the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the new state should be:

**State: `thorn` is 0, `s` must have at least one character, `i` is the first character of `s`**
