Output State: **`thorn` is 1**

The code `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. Since the initial state of `thorn` is 0 and there is no variable named `ret` mentioned in the initial state, we assume `ret` is a new variable that gets its value from the operation. After executing `ret += 1`, the value of `ret` becomes 1. The value of `thorn` remains unchanged at 0, but since `ret` is the only variable affected by the code, the output state is updated accordingly.
