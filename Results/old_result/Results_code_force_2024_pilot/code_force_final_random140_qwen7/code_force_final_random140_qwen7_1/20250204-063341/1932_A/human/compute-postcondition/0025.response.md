Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`, which iterates over each character in the list `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the list `s`.

3. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `thorn` is either 2 or 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `len` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a non-empty list of characters.
   - `ret` is 0.
   - The character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` is not `'@'`.
   - If the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is set to 2. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, the list `s` will lose one character per iteration.
   - The character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` will change with each iteration, but the condition that it is not `'@'` still holds.
   - The value of `thorn` will remain the same unless the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` changes to '*'. However, since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify that the character at index `@` changed to '*', we assume `thorn` remains the same.
   - The other variables (`t`, `len`, `ret`) do not change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `s` will be the list `s` without the first character (since `i` is iterating over each character in `s`).
- `thorn` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either 2 or 0).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`thorn` is either 2 or 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty list of characters (with the first character removed), `ret` is 0, and the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` is not `'@'`.**
