Postcondition: `thorn` is either 1 or 0, `s` remains the same non-empty string, and `i` changes to the next character in the string `s`. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains 0 and `i` becomes the second character of string `s`.
