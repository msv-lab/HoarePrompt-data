Postcondition: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), `ret` is 2 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 2 if `i` is '*' and 0 otherwise, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
