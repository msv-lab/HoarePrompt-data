You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is always '.', indicating that the path starts with an empty cell.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        len = int(input())
        
        s = list(input())
        
        ret = 0
        
        thorn = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == '@':
                thorn = 0
                ret += 1
            elif i == '*':
                thorn += 1
                if thorn == 2:
                    break
            else:
                thorn = 0
        
        print(ret)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` contains the total number of characters in the input string for the last test case, `s` is a list of characters from the last input string, `ret` is the count of paths that were not terminated by two consecutive '*', which can be 0, 1, or any value up to the number of '@' characters in the string, and `thorn` is 2 if any character in `s` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0. The variable `i` holds the last character processed in the list `s`.
    #
    #This means that `ret` will be incremented every time an '@' is encountered, and the loop will terminate early if two consecutive '*' are found. The final value of `ret` will reflect the number of valid paths through the string, and `thorn` will indicate whether any '*' characters were processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer between 1 and 50, with a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', starting with '.'. The function returns information based on the given string of characters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
