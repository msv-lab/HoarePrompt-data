Postcondition: `thorn` is either 2 or 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `ret` is 0, and the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` is not `'@'`. If the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is set to 2. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.
