Postcondition: **`thorn` is either 0 or 1, `s` remains the same non-empty string, and `i` changes to the next character in the string `s`. If `thorn` equals 2, the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains 0. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1.**
