Output State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, and the character `i` is not '*', `i` is not '@'**.

The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `thorn`. Since `thorn` was already `0` in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions also remain the same as the initial state.
