Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `s`**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `i` is the loop counter, which will iterate over each character in the list `s`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `s`. The variable `i` will take on each value in the list `s` one by one.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` will iterate through each character in `s`, we don't need to specify an initial value for `i` because it will be set by the loop itself.
   - We need to ensure that the list `s` is not empty for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `s` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0**
