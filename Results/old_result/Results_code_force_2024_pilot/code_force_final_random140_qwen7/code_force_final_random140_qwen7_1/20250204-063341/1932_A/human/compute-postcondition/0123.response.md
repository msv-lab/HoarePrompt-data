Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the list `s` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `len` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character.
   - `ret` is 0.
   - `thorn` is either 2 if the character `i` is '*', or 0 if the character `i` is not '*'.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in the list `s`, the variable `i` will be set to the next character in the list `s`.
   - The list `s` will lose its first element after each iteration because it is being iterated over directly.
   - The variable `thorn` will be reset to 0 at the start of each new iteration since it is not preserved across iterations.
   - The variable `ret` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays as 0.
   - The variable `len` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `s` will be the list without its first element.
   - `thorn` will be reset to 0.
   - `ret` remains 0.
   - `len` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0**.
