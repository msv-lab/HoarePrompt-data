Output State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1, and the character `i` is '*'**.

The code `thorn += 1` increments the value of `thorn` by 1. Since `thorn` was initially 0, after executing this line, `thorn` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
