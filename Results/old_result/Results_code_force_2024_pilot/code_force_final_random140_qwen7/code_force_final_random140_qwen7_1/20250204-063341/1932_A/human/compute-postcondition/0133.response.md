Postcondition: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), `ret` is 1, `thorn` is either 0 or 1. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` is set to 1. If `thorn` equals 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` does not equal '@', `ret` remains 0 and `thorn` remains either 0 or 1.
