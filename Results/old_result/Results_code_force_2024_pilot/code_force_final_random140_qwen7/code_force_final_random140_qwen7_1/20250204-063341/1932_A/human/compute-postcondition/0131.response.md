Postcondition: `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 0 or 1. If within the if part, `thorn` equals 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.
