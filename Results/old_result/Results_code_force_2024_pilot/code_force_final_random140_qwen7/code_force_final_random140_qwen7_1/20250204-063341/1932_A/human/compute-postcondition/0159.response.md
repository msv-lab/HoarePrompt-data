Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data consisting of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of input. Each set includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', representing an empty cell, a cell with a coin, and a cell with thorns respectively, with the first character always being '.'. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**
