Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty list of characters (with the first character removed), `ret` is 0, and the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` is not `'@'`**.

Explanation: The line `thorn = 0` changes the value of `thorn` from either 2 or 0 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
