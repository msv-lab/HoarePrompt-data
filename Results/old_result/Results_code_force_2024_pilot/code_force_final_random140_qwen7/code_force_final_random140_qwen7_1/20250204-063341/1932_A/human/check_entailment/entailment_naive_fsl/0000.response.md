Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for moving two cells at a time and ensuring that the destination cell does not contain thorns. The program only allows moving one cell at a time and does not handle the case where the next two cells can be skipped if the second cell is not a thorn. This leads to missing out on collecting coins that are two cells away from the current position. For example, in the input `".@@*@.**@@"`:

- Starting from the first cell (`.`), the program would collect the coin at the second cell (`@`).
- However, it would not consider moving to the fourth cell (`@`) because the third cell (`*`) is a thorn, and the program only allows moving one cell at a time.

To fix this, the program needs to check for both one-step and two-step moves while ensuring the destination cell is not a thorn.
