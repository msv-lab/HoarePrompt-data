Output State: **`thorn` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `ret` is 0, the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` is equal to '*', and the current value of `i` is '*', and the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` is not `'@'`.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values or affect the conditions of the other variables. It simply exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is within. Since no such loop or if statement context is provided, the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
