Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` which iterates over the list `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `s` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `len` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character).
   - `ret` is 1.
   - `thorn` is either 0 or 1.

4. **Loop behavior**:
   - If `i` equals '*', `thorn` is set to 1.
   - If `thorn` equals 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `i` does not equal '@', `ret` remains 0 and `thorn` remains unchanged.

5. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `s`, the variable `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `ret` will remain 1 unless `i` equals '*'.
   - `thorn` will remain unchanged unless it becomes 2 due to some condition outside the loop body.

Given that the loop is about to start its next iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be the next character in the list `s`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `ret` remains 1.
   - `thorn` remains unchanged.

Since `s` must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), and we are moving to the next character, `s` still has at least 1 character.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character (excluding the first character), `ret` is 1, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.
