Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty list of characters (with the first character removed), `ret` is 1, and the character `i` at index `@` in the list `s` is not `'@'`.**

Explanation: The variable `ret` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
