Postcondition: `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers starting from index 5 to the end of the original list `a`, `new_all` is the result of the all function applied to a list comprehension checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element, `t` must be greater than 0, `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, `new` is now a slice of `a` starting from index 5 (which is `i`) to the end, and in both cases (whether the condition `check_all and new_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
