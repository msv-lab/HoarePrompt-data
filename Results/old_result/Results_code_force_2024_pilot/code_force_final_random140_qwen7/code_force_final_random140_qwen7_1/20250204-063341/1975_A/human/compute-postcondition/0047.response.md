Output State: **Postcondition: `check_all` remains unchanged, `new_all` remains unchanged, `i` equals 3, and `n` remains the same as before.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `check_all` and `new_all` will remain the same as they were after the last iteration (which is the third iteration based on the given information). The variable `i` will be set to 3 because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`, and after the third iteration, `i` will be incremented to 4 but the loop will terminate. Therefore, `i` will be 3 when the loop exits. The variable `n` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
