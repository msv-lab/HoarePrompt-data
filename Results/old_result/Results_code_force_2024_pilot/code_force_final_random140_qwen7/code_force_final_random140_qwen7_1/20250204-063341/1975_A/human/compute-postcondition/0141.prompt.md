Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with the first element being the input integer `n` followed by other integers, `new_all` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `check_all` is False, and `new` is now a slice of `a` starting from index `n-1` (which is `i`) to the end.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, the element at index 0 in list `a` is greater than the element at index 1 in list `a`, `new` is a sublist starting from index 1 to the end of list `a`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of whether `check_all` and `new_all` are true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`. `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`. `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is true, then either `check_all` or `new_all` is false and the loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is false, then no changes are made to `check_all` and `new_all`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `check_all` is True and `new_all` is False, and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the states remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
