Output State: **`new_all` is True if all elements in `new[1:]` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a[2:]` are less than or equal to the previous element; `i` is 0; `n` is the same as before. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `new_all`, `check_all`, `i`, or `n`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
