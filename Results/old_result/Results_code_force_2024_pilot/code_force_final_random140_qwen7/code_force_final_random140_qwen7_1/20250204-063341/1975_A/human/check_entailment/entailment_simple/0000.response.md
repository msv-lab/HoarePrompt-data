Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array `a` itself.
3. It checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because no operations are needed.
4. If the array is not sorted, it iterates through the array to find a point where the current element is less than the previous one (`a[i - 1] > a[i]`). At this point, it splits the array into two parts: `x` (the prefix ending at `i-1`) and `y` (the suffix starting from `i`).
5. It then checks if the prefix `x` is greater than every element in the suffix `y` and if the suffix `y` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
6. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' because the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the two parts.
7. If the conditions are not satisfied for any split, it prints 'NO'.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem statement. Therefore, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
