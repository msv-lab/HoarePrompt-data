Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head (`for i in range(1, n)`).
   - The variable `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `check_all` is a boolean variable that is initially set to `False`.

Since the loop head only involves `i` and `n`, and `i` is already set to 1, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
