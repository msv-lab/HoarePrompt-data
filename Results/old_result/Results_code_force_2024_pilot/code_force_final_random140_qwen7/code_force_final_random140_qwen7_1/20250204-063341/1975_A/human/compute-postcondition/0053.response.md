Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` remains unchanged, `new_all` remains unchanged, `i` equals 3, `n` remains the same as before, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The variable `n` is reassigned to the new input integer. All other variables (`check_all`, `new_all`, `i`, `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
