Based on the initial state provided:

- `check_all` is a boolean that is True if all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than the next element.
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `new_all` remains unchanged (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
