Output State: **`i` is 2; `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` which contains elements from index `i` (which is 2) to the end of the list `a`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the initial state of `n` as an input integer is still valid but not directly affected by this operation.
