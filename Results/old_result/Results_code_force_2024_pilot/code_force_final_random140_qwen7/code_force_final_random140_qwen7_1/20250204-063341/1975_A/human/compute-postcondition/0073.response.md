Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers starting from index 3 to the end of the original list `a`.
   - `new_all` remains unchanged.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of length of `new`. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`, `check_all` is set to False. Otherwise, `check_all` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, so the next value of `i` will be 4.

5. **Determine the New Condition for `n`:**
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.
   - `a`, `new_all`, `t`, and `check_all` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers starting from index 3 to the end of the original list `a`, `new_all` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, and `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of length of `new`. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`, `check_all` is set to False. Otherwise, `check_all` remains unchanged.**
