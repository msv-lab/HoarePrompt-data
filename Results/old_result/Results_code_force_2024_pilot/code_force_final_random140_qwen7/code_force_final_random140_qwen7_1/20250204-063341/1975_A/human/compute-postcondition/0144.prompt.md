Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The variables `n` and `a` are not defined yet.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. `check_all` remains unchanged, `new_all` remains unchanged, `i` equals 3, and `n` remains the same as before.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers starting from index `n-1` to the end of the original list `a`, `new_all` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, and `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, and if `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is set to False. Otherwise, `check_all` remains unchanged. `new` is now a slice of `a` starting from index `n-1` (which is `i`) to the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `new` is a slice from index `n-1` to the end of the list `a`. `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`. `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one. The loop will continue to iterate as long as `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is true for some `i`. If the condition is never met throughout the loop, the loop will finish without printing 'YES' or 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
