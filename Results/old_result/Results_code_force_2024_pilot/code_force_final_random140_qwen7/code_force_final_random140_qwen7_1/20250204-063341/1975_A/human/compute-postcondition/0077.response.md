Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` is greater than 3 but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `a` is a list of integers starting from index 4 to the end of the original list `a`.
- `new_all` is explicitly given as True but it's not used in the print statement.
- `t` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not needed.
- `check_all` is a boolean value determined by a condition, but since the condition does not affect the print statement, it doesn't change the output.

The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES', so the output is **YES**.
