Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `a` of length `n` (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`) and checks if the list is strictly increasing. If not, it further checks if the list can be split into two parts such that the first part is strictly increasing and the second part, when reversed, is also strictly increasing. The function prints 'YES' if either condition is met for any test case, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The final output is based on the conditions evaluated for each test case.**
