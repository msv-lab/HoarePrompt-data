Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is True if all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order starting from the first element, otherwise `check_all` is False.**

This means that the variable `check_all` is set to `True` if every element in the list `a` is greater than the previous element, starting from the second element up to the nth element. Otherwise, `check_all` is set to `False`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
