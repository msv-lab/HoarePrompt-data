Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. However, there are some logical issues with the current implementation:

1. **Strictly Increasing Check**: The program first checks if the entire array is strictly increasing using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. This is correct for determining if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Splitting and Checking**: When the array is not strictly increasing, the program tries to find a valid split point `i` where the subarray `a[i:]` can be rearranged to be non-decreasing. It incorrectly checks if the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than every element in the subarray `new`, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should check if the subarray `new` is non-decreasing and if the first part of the array `a[:i]` is greater than or equal to the last element of `new`.

3. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve this problem, one should:
   - Check if the array is already sorted.
   - If not, find the smallest index `i` such that `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
   - Check if the subarray `a[i:]` is non-decreasing.
   - Check if the prefix `a[:i]` is greater than or equal to the last element of the subarray `a[i:]`.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not properly handle the conditions required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by the specified operation.

Correctness: **False**
