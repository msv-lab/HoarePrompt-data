Postcondition: **`i` is 2; `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one. In either case (whether the condition `check_all and new_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
