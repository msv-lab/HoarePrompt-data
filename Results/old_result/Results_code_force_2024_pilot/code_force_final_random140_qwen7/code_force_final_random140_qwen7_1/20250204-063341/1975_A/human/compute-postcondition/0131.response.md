Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`
   - `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`
   - `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one
   - The condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` determines whether `check_all` or `new_all` is false and the loop or if statement is broken.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`, meaning `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The slice `new` will now be from index 3 to the end of the list `a`.
   - The values of `check_all` and `new_all` remain unchanged unless the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is met.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be 3.
- `new` will be a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all` and `new_all` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one.**
