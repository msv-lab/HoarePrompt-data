Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `check_all` is True and `new_all` is False, and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the states remain unchanged.**
