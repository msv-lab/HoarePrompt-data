Postcondition: `i` is 2, `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`. `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`. `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next one. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is true, then either `check_all` or `new_all` is false and the loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is false, then no changes are made to `check_all` and `new_all`.
