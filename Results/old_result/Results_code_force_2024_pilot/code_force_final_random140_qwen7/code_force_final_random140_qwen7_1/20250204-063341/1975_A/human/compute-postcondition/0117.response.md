Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer. If the element at index 0 in list `a` is greater than the element at index 1 in list `a`, then `new` is a sublist starting from index 1 to the end of list `a`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`.
