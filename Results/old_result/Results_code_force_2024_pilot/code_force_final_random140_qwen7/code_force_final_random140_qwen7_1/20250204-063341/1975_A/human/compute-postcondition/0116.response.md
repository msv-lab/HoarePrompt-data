Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, the element at index 0 in list `a` is greater than the element at index 1 in list `a`, `new` is a sublist starting from index 1 to the end of list `a`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of whether `check_all` and `new_all` are true or false.**
