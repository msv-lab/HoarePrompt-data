Output State: **`check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element, and `new_all` is the result of checking if all elements in `new` satisfy the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i])` for `i` from 1 to the length of `new`.**

This means that `new_all` is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the list `new` is non-decreasing (each element is less than or equal to the previous one). The initial state of `check_all` remains unchanged.
