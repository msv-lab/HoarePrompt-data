Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- The element at index 0 in list `a` is greater than the element at index 1 in list `a`.
- `new` is a sublist starting from index 1 to the end of list `a`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the element at index 0 in list `a`, and it is true.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and it is true.
- The condition `check_all and new_all` is true.

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
