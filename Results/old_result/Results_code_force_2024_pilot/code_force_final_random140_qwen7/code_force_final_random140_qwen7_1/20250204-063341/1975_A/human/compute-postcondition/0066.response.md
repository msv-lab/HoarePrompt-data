Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers starting from index 3 to the end of the original list `a`, `new_all` is True, `t` is greater than 0, the current value of `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`, `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i])` for each `i` in the range of length of `new`, and either `check_all` is False or `new_all` is False.
