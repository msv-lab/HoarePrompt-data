Postcondition: `check_all` is True if all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than the next element, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `new_all` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, the current value of `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`.
