Output State: **`ans` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. After executing the code, `s` will start with `0` followed by the original elements of `s`. All other variables (`ans`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
