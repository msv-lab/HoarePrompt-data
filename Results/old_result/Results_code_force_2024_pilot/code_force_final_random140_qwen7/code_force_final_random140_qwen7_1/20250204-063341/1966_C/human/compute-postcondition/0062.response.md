Output State: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` remains either 0 or 1, `i` will be `n + 1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` must be at least as large as the number of iterations performed, which is `n`. The set `s` contains every element from the list `arr` starting from index 0 up to index `n-1`. The list `arr` remains unchanged as it was provided as input.
