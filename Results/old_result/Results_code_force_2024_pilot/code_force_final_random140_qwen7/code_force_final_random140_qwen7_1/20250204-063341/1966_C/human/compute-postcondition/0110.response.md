Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n - 1 + 1 = n`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to adjust `i` to `n`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The set `s` still contains the element `arr[i]`, but since `i` changes, the element in `s` will change to `arr[n]`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now `n`
   - `n` remains the same (an input integer)
   - `s` is a set containing the element `arr[n]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a set containing the element `arr[n]`**
