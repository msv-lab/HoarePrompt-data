Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `arr[i]` is added to set `s`

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `n - 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n`. Since `i` was `n - 2` in the previous iteration, incrementing `i` to `n - 1` means it is now `n - 1`, which is still less than `n` (assuming `n > 1`).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `arr[i]` (which is `arr[n-2]` in the previous iteration) is added to set `s` again in the new iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr[i]` is added to set `s`**
