Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `arr[i]` is added to set `s`**.

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Here, `i` is initially `n - 1`. After executing the line of code, `i` is decremented by 1 (since array indexing typically starts from 0), making `i` equal to `n - 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was an input integer. The set `s` now contains the element `arr[i]`, which is `arr[n - 2]`.
