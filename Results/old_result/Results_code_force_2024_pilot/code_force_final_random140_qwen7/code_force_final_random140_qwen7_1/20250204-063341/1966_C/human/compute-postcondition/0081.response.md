Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`, and `n` is not equal to 2. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, setting `ans` to 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.
