Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code adds `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `arr[i]` refers to the last element of the array `arr`. The output state includes the updated set `s` which now contains the element `arr[i]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
