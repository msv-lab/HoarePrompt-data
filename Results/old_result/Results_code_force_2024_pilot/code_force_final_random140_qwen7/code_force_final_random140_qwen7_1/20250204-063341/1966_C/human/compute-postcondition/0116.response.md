Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` remains the same (an input integer), `s` is a list where the first element is 0 and followed by all unique elements from the list `arr`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. The initial state of `s` is a list containing all unique elements from the list `arr`. After executing the code, the first element of `s` becomes `0`, and the rest of the elements remain the same as they were before. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `ans` stays as `1`.
