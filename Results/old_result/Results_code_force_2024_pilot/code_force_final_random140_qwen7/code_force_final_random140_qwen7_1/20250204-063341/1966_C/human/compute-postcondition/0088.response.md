Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. All other variables retain their initial states.
