Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns a result based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` positive integers. The function processes these inputs to produce a specific output for each test case, adhering to the constraints provided.
