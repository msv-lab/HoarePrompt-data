Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`**

Explanation: The code `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` from either 1 or 0 to its opposite. Since `ans` was initially either 1 or 0, after executing the code, `ans` will be 0 if it was 1, and 1 if it was 0. The values of `i`, `n`, and the list `s` remain unchanged.
