Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state; it will start from 0 in the first iteration.
   - `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified in the initial state.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given this information, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0 (which is the default starting value).

Here is the modified state:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
