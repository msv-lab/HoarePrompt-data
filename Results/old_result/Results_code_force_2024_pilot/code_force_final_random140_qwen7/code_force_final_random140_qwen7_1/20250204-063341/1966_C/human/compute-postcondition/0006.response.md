Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` contains `arr[0]`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

6. **Consider the state of `s`**: The state of `s` is not directly influenced by the loop head variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, we do not need to adjust the state of `s` for the loop to continue.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` contains `arr[0]`**
