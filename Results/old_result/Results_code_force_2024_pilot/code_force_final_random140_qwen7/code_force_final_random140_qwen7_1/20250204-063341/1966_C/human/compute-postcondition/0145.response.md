Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list where the first element is 0 and followed by all unique elements from the list `arr`, and `ans` is 1 if the length of the list `s` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 if the condition `s[i] - s[i-1] <= 1` holds for all `i` from 1 to `n-2`; otherwise, `ans` is not 0.
