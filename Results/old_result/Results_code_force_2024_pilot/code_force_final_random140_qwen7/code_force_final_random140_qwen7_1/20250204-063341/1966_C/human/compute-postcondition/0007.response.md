Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` contains `arr[1]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `s.add(arr[1])` is executed, adding `arr[1]` to the set `s`. After this operation, `i` is incremented to 2 (though this increment is not shown in the code snippet, it's implied by the context). The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
