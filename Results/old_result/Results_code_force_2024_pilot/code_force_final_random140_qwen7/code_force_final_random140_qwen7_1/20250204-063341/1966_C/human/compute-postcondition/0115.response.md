Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` remains the same (an input integer), `s` is a list containing all unique elements from the list `arr`, `ans` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only new information is that `ans` is now set to 1.
