Output State: **`ans` is either -1, 0, or 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an empty set, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The line `s = set()` creates an empty set named `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `i`, `n`, `s` (other than making it an empty set), or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states except that `s` is now an empty set.
