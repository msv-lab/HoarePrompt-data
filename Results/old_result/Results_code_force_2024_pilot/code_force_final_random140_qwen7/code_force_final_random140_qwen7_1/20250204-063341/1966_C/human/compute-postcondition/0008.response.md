Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` contains `arr[1]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0, but since no information is given that `n` might change, we assume `n` remains the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The state of `s` (which contains `arr[1]`) does not change as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `s` contains `arr[1]`**
