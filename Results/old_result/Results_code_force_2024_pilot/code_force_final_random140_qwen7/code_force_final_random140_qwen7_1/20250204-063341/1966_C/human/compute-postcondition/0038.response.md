Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`**

Explanation: The code `ans = 1 - ans` flips the value of `ans`. Since `ans` was either 0 or 1 initially, after executing the code, `ans` will be the opposite value. Given that `ans` was either 0 or 1, after the operation, `ans` will be 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and the list `s` remain unchanged.
