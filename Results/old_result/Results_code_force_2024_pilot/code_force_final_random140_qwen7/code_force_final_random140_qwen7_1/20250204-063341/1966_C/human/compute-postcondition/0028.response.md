Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `s[i] - s[i - 1] is less than or equal to 1**.

Explanation: The line `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` from 1 to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged according to the initial state.
