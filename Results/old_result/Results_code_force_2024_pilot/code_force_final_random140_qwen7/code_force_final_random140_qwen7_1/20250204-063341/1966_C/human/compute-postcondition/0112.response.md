Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` remains the same (an input integer), `s` is a set containing all elements from the list `arr`.

In the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1` and then stops. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr` because each element of `arr` is added to `s` in each iteration of the loop.
