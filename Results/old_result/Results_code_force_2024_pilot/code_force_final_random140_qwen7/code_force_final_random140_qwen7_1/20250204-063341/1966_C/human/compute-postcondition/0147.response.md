Output State: **The final output will be 'Alice' if `ans` is 1 after all iterations, and 'Bob' if `ans` is 0 after all iterations.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `ans` will determine the final output. If `ans` is 1, the output will be 'Alice'. If `ans` is 0, the output will be 'Bob'. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` (the length of the list `s`), and `s` will contain 0 followed by all unique elements from the list `arr`. The exact value of `ans` depends on whether the condition `s[i] - s[i-1] <= 1` holds for all `i` from 1 to `n-2` for cases where `n` is greater than 2.
