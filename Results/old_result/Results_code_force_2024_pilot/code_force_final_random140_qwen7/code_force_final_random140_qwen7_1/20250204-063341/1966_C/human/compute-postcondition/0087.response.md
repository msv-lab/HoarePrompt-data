Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n-2` (since `range(1, n - 1)` generates values from 1 up to but not including `n-1`).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s`.
   - `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n-1`. Therefore, `n` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Postconditions**:
   - The postcondition for the loop body is not directly affecting the loop itself, so no changes are needed for `ans`, `s`, or `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]**.
