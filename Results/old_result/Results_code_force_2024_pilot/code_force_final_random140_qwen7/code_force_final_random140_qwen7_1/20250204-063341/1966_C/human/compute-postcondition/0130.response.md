Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `1`.
   - The postcondition states that if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than `1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is `0`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and the loop runs until `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `2`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` needs to be set to `2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `1` (since no information suggests `n` changes within the loop).
   - The postcondition for `ans` remains the same unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `ans` remains `0` unless explicitly changed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is 0**.
