Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string using `input().split()`, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `arr`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
