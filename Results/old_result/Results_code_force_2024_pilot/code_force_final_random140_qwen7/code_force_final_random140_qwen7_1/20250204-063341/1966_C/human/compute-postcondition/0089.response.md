Output State: **`ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]**.

Explanation: The line `ans = 1 - ans` flips the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is either 0 or 1 initially, after executing the line, if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `ans` was 1, it becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
