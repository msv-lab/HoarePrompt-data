Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`, `ans` is flipped from its original value.**

Explanation: The code `ans = 1 - ans` flips the value of `ans`. If `ans` was originally 1, it becomes 0, and if `ans` was originally 0, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
