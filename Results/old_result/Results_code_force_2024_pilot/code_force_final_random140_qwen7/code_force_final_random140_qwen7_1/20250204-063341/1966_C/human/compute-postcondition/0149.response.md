Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It then determines and prints whether Alice or Bob wins based on a specific condition related to the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted unique list of stones. If the condition is met, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Bob'.**
