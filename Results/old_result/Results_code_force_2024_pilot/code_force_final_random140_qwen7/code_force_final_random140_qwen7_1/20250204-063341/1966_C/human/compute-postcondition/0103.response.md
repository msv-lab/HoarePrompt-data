Output State: **`ans` is either -1, 0, or 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is updated to be equal to the new value of `n`, and `n` now holds the value of the input integer.
