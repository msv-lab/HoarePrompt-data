Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 represents the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    ans = 1
    s = [0] + s
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans = 1 - ans
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, and `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If `n` equals 2, then `ans` remains as 1. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is either -1, 0, or 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`. If `n` equals 2, then `ans` remains unchanged as it is already either -1, 0, or 1. If `n` is not 2, then `ans` is either -1 or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list where the first element is 0 and followed by all unique elements from the list `arr`, `ans` is 1 if the length of the list `s` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is 0 if the condition `s[i] - s[i-1] <= 1` holds for all `i` from 1 to `n-2`, and `i` is `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
