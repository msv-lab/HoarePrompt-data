Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`, and `n` is not equal to 2, and `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1**.

Explanation: The initial value of `ans` is 1. The line `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` from 1 to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
