Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved in this loop is the input value obtained from `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
     - `ans` is either -1, 0, or 1.
     - `i` is `n`.
     - `n` is the length of list `s`.
     - `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`.
     - If `n` equals 2, then `ans` remains unchanged as it is already either -1, 0, or 1.
     - If `n` is not 2, then `ans` is either -1 or 0.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop will execute again if the input value (which is an integer) is greater than 0.
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the next state will depend on the input value.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which determines how many times the loop will run.
   - Let's assume the input value is `k` (where `k` is a positive integer).

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ans` is either -1, 0, or 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing `[0, arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1]]`, and the input value for the next iteration is `k` (a positive integer)**.
