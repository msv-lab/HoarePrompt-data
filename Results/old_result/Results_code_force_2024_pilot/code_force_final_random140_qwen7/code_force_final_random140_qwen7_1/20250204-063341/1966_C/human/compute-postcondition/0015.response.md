Output State: **`ans` is 1, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `ans` is 1.
- `n` was previously set to `i`, which was equal to `n`. After executing `n = len(s)`, `n` now holds the length of the list `s`.
- `i` is updated to the new value of `n`.
- The list `s` remains unchanged, still containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.
