Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an empty set, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The line `s = set()` creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
