Output State: **Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 3, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `ans` will retain its last updated value, which could be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was ever true during any iteration of the loop. The length of the list `s` (`n`) must be greater than 3 for the loop to run at least three times as specified in the given conditions. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `n`, and `s`) will maintain their final states after the loop has completed all its iterations.
