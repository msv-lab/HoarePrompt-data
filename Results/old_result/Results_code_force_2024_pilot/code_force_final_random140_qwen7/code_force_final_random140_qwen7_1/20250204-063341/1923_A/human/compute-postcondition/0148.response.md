Output State: **`cnt1` is either 5 or 4, `idx` is 8, `cnt0` is `cnt0 - 1`, `ans` retains its initial value based on `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `cnt0 -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt0` by 1. Since `cnt0` initially retains its value determined by the count of 0s in `arrs`, after decrementing, `cnt0` becomes `cnt0 - 1`. All other variables (`cnt1`, `idx`, `ans`, and `t`) retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.
