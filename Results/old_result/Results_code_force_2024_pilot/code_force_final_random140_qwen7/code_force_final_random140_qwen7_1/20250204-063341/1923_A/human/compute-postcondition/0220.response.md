Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of `len(arrs)`. This means `idx` will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the length of `arrs`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `idx` is currently 1.
   - `cnt1` is either 2 if `arrs[1]` equals 1, or remains 1 if `arrs[1]` does not equal 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `idx` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `idx` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `idx` must be less than `len(arrs)`. Therefore, `arrs` must have at least 3 elements (since `idx` is now 2).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `idx` will be incremented to 2.
   - `cnt1` will be determined based on the value of `arrs[2]`. It will be 2 if `arrs[2]` equals 1, or remain 1 if `arrs[2]` does not equal 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `idx` is 2, `cnt1` is either 2 if `arrs[2]` equals 1, or remains 1 if `arrs[2]` does not equal 1, and `arrs` must have at least 3 elements.**
