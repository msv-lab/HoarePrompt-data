Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt1` is 0, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs)`, `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `ans` retains its initial value based on the final `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is decremented by the number of iterations which is `len(arrs)`
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[idx] == 1:
        cnt1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt1` is 2, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `ans` retains its initial value based on the final `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is decremented by the number of iterations which is `len(arrs)` and the current value of `t` is `len(arrs) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cnt1` is either 3 or 2, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` retains its initial value, `ans` retains its initial value, `t` is `len(arrs) - 2`. If `arrs[idx]` equals 1, then `cnt1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cnt1` is either 4 or 3, `idx` is 3, `cnt0` retains its initial value, `ans` retains its initial value, `t` is `len(arrs) - 2`. If `arrs[idx]` equals 1, then `cnt1` becomes 4. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
