Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for idx in range(len(arrs)):`. The objects involved here are `idx` and `len(arrs)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `idx` is initially set to the length of `arrs` minus 1.
   - `len(arrs)` is the length of the list `arrs`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `idx` is less than `len(arrs)`. 

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `idx` starts at `length - 1`, we need to ensure that `idx` is within the bounds of the list `arrs`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `idx` must be greater than or equal to 0 (since `range(len(arrs))` will iterate from 0 to `len(arrs) - 1`).

Given the initial conditions:
- `cnt0` is 3.
- `_` is 0.
- `length` is an input integer.
- `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
- `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs` minus 1.
- `cnt1` is 0.

We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute at least once. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `idx` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

**State:**
- `idx` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `arrs` must have at least one element.

Since `idx` is initially set to `length - 1`, and we need it to be non-negative, we don't need to explicitly mention `length` again, as it is already defined and should be at least 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`idx` must be greater than or equal to 0, arrs must have at least one element**
