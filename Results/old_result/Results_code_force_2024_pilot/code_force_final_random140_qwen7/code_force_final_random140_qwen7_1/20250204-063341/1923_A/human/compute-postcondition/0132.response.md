Output State: **`cnt1` is 2, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `ans` retains its initial value based on the final `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is decremented by the number of iterations which is `len(arrs)` and the current value of `t` is `len(arrs) - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt1` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. The other variables (`idx`, `cnt0`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states as described in the precondition.
