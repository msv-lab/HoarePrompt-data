Output State: **`cnt0` is 2, `_` is 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`_`, `length`, `arrs`, and `idx`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
