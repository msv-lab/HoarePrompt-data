Output State: **`cnt1` is 0, all elements in `arrs` have been iterated over, `idx` equals `len(arrs)`, and `cnt0` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 0 at index `idx` where `arrs[0]` is also 0.**

Explanation: The line `cnt1 = 0` initializes `cnt1` to 0. This does not affect the values of `arrs`, `idx`, or `cnt0`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
