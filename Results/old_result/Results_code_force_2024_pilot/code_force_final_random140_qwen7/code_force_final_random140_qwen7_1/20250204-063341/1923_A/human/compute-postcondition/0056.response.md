Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each index in the list `arrs` using `range(len(arrs))`. This means `idx` will take on values from `0` to `len(arrs) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arrs` is a list of integers.
   - `idx` is an index within the range of `arrs`.
   - If `arrs[idx]` is equal to 1, then `cnt1` is increased by 1.
   - If `arrs[idx]` is not equal to 1, no changes are made to `cnt1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `idx` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `idx` was some value `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `idx` will be `k + 1`.
   - The list `arrs` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `cnt1` will depend on whether `arrs[k]` was equal to 1 or not.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `arrs` remains the same.
   - `idx` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes `idx + 1`.
   - `cnt1` will remain the same unless `arrs[idx]` was equal to 1, but since we don't know the exact value of `arrs[idx]`, we cannot change `cnt1` without additional information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an index within the range of `arrs` and is equal to the previous `idx` plus 1, and `cnt1` is the same as the previous `cnt1`.**
