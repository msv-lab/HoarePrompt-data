Output State: **`idx` is the length of `arrs`, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`, the first element of `arrs` is 0, the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is `cnt0 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt0 -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt0` by 1. The other variables (`idx`, `cnt1`, the first and last elements of `arrs`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
