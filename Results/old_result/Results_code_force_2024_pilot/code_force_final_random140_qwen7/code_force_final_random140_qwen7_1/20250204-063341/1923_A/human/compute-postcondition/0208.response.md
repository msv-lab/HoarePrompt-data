Output State: **All elements in `arrs` have been iterated over, `idx` equals `len(arrs)`, and `cnt0` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 0 at index `idx` where `arrs[0]` is also 0.**

In this final state, the variable `idx` will be equal to the length of `arrs` because the loop increments `idx` in each iteration until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `cnt0` will be incremented by 1 for every zero found at the current index `idx` (which is always one position ahead of the last checked index due to the loop incrementing `idx` at each step) as long as `arrs[0]` is also 0. All other variables (`arrs`, `cnt1`, `ans`, and `t`) will retain their values from the initial state since they are not modified within the loop.
