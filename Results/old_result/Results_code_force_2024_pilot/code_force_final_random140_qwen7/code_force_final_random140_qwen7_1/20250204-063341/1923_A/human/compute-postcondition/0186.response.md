Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arrs` using `range(len(arrs))`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an integer and is not equal to 0.
   - The loop body increments or sets `cnt0` based on the values of `arrs[0]` and `arrs[idx]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `idx` must be less than `len(arrs)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `idx` is currently an integer and is not equal to 0, the next value of `idx` should be `idx + 1` to ensure it continues within the bounds of the list.
   - `arrs` remains unchanged as the loop body does not modify the list itself; it only modifies `cnt0` based on the values of `arrs[0]` and `arrs[idx]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `idx` will be incremented by 1, so if it was `idx` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `idx + 1`.
   - `arrs` remains the same list of integers.
   - `cnt0` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since we are only concerned with the loop head variables, we do not adjust `cnt0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an integer and is equal to `idx + 1` (where `idx` was not equal to 0 at the end of the previous iteration)**.
