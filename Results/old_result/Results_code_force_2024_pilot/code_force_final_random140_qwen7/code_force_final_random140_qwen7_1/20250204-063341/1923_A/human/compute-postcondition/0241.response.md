Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because it is decremented with each iteration and starts from the number of test cases. The value of `cnt0` will be the total count of transitions from 1 to 0 in the arrays minus the number of times the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element is also 0 across all test cases. `cnt1` will be the total count of 1s in all arrays. The value of `ans` will be 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, and `cnt0` otherwise.

In simpler terms, `t` will be 0, `cnt0` will reflect the net transitions from 1 to 0 across all arrays, `cnt1` will be the total number of 1s, and `ans` will be 0 if there are no 1s or exactly one 1, and the net transitions from 1 to 0 otherwise.
