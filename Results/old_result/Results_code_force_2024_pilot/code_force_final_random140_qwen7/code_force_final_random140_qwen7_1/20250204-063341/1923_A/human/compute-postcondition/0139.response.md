Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range of `len(arrs)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt1` is either 3 or 2.
   - `idx` is 2.
   - `cnt0` retains its initial value.
   - `ans` retains its initial value.
   - `t` is `len(arrs) - 2`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop increments `idx` from 0 to `len(arrs) - 1`.
   - If `arrs[idx]` equals 1, then `cnt1` is incremented by 1.

5. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `idx` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `idx` will be 3.
   - We need to check if `arrs[3]` is 1 to determine the new value of `cnt1`.
   - `cnt0` and `ans` retain their initial values.
   - `t` remains `len(arrs) - 2`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `idx` will be 3.
   - `cnt1` will be either 3 (if `arrs[3]` is 1) or 2 (if `arrs[3]` is not 1).
   - `cnt0` retains its initial value.
   - `ans` retains its initial value.
   - `t` remains `len(arrs) - 2`.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cnt1` is either 3 or 2, `idx` is 3, `cnt0` retains its initial value, `ans` retains its initial value, `t` is `len(arrs) - 2`**.
