Output State: **`cnt0` is increased by 1, `idx` is within the range [0, len(arrs) - 1], `arrs` is a list of integers created from user input, and either `arrs[0]` equals 1 or `idx` equals 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cnt0 += 1` increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. The other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
