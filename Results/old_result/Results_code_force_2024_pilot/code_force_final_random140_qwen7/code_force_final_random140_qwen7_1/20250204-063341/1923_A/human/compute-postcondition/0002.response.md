State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and we have read an input integer which is the number of test cases, `_` is the loop variable initialized to 0**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Variable (`_`)**: The loop variable `_` is typically initialized to 0 before the loop starts. This is because the `range(t)` function generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
2. **Value of `t`**: The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will run. Since `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 1000, it doesn't need to be adjusted further.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of the loop variable `_`, which should be set to 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and we have read an input integer which is the number of test cases, `_` is the loop variable initialized to 0**
