Output State: **`cnt0` is increased by 1, `idx` is not 0, `arrs` is a list of integers created from user input, the first element of `arrs` is 0, and the value of `arrs[idx]` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt0` is incremented by 1. The value of `idx` remains unchanged and is still not 0. The list `arrs` and its properties remain the same, with the first element being 0 and the value of `arrs[idx]` still being 0.
