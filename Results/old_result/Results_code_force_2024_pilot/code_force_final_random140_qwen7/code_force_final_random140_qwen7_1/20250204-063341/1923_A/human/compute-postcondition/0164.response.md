Output State: **`cnt1` is either 1 or 0, `idx` is 8, `length` is an input integer, `cnt0` is `cnt0 - 1` if `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, `ans` is 0 if `cnt1` is either 1 or 0, and `ans` is `cnt0` if `cnt1` is either 5 or 4, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `length = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `length`. This input is converted to an integer. The values of `cnt1`, `idx`, `cnt0`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
