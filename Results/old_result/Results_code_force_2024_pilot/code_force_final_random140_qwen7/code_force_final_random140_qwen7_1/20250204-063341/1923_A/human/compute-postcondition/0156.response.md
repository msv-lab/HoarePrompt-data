Output State: **`cnt1` is either 1 or 0, `idx` is 8, `cnt0` is `cnt0 - 1` if `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, `ans` is 0, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to `0`, but the conditions and values of other variables like `cnt1`, `idx`, `cnt0`, and `t` remain as they were in the initial state.
