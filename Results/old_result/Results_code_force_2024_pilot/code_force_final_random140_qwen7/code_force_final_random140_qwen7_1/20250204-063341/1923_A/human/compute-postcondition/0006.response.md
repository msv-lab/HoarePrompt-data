Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `idx`: This variable is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `len(arrs)`: This is the condition that determines whether the loop continues.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `idx`**: The variable `idx` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, `idx` should be set to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will continue as long as `idx < len(arrs)`. Since `idx` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `len(arrs)` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the State of `arrs`**: The list `arrs` is used in the loop, but its content does not directly affect the loop's execution. However, for the loop to execute, `arrs` must contain at least one element, meaning `len(arrs)` must be at least 1.

5. **Summarize the Adjusted States**:
   - `cnt0` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `_` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `length` is an input integer (this does not directly affect the loop execution, but we can assume it is used to determine `len(arrs)`).
   - `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and it must have at least one element.

Based on this analysis, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`cnt0` is 0, `_` is 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `idx` is 0**.
