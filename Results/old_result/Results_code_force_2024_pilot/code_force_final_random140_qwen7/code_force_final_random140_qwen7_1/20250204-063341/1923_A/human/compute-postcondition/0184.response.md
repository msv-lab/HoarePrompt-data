Postcondition: `arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an integer and is not equal to 0. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is incremented by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` equals 0, then `cnt0` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains unchanged and all other elements in `arrs` remain unchanged.
