Output State: **`idx` is the length of `arrs`, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`, the first element of `arrs` is 0, the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1 if the last element of `arrs` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
