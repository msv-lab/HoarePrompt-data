Output State: **`idx` is 2; `cnt1` is either 3 if `arrs[1]` equals 1, or remains 2 if `arrs[1]` does not equal 1.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt1` is incremented by 1. If `arrs[1]` was previously equal to 1, making `cnt1` equal to 2, then after executing `cnt1 += 1`, `cnt1` becomes 3. If `arrs[1]` was not equal to 1, making `cnt1` equal to 1, then after executing `cnt1 += 1`, `cnt1` becomes 2. The value of `idx` remains unchanged.
