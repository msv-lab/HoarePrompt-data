Postcondition: `cnt1` is 1, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `ans` retains its initial value based on the final `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is decremented by the number of iterations which is `len(arrs)` and the current value of `t` is `len(arrs) - 1`.
