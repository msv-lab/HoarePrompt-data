Output State: **All elements in `arrs` have been checked, `idx` is now equal to the length of `arrs`, and `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `idx` will iterate through every index of `arrs` starting from the last index (initially set to `length - 1`) until it reaches the end of the list. During each iteration, if the current element `arrs[idx]` is equal to 1, `cnt1` is incremented. Once `idx` has gone through all indices of `arrs`, the loop terminates. At this point, `idx` will be equal to the length of `arrs`, and `cnt1` will hold the total count of 1s present in the list `arrs`.
