Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `idx` and `arrs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index in the range of `len(arrs)`. This means `idx` will iterate from 0 to `len(arrs) - 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `arrs` is a list of integers.
   - `idx` is an index within the range of `arrs` and is equal to the previous `idx` plus 1.
   - `cnt1` is the previous `cnt1` plus 1 if `arrs[idx]` equals 1. If `arrs[idx]` does not equal 1, `cnt1` remains the same as the previous `cnt1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `idx` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `idx` will be the previous `idx` plus 1.
   - The value of `arrs[idx]` will determine whether `cnt1` is incremented or not.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `arrs` remains the same.
   - `idx` becomes the previous `idx` plus 1.
   - `cnt1` will be the previous `cnt1` plus 1 if `arrs[idx]` equals 1, otherwise it remains the same.

Given the previous state where `idx` is the previous `idx` plus 1 and `cnt1` is updated based on the value of `arrs[idx]`, the new state for the next iteration is:

State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is the previous `idx` plus 1, and `cnt1` is the previous `cnt1` plus 1 if `arrs[idx]` equals 1, otherwise `cnt1` remains the same.**
