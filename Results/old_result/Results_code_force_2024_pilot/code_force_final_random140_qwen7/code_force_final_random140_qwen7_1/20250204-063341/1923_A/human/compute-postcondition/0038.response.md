Output State: **`cnt0` is 3, `_` is 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `idx` is 2.**

Explanation: The code increments `cnt0` by 1. Initially, `cnt0` was 2, so after executing `cnt0 += 1`, `cnt0` becomes 3. The values of `_`, `length`, `arrs`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
