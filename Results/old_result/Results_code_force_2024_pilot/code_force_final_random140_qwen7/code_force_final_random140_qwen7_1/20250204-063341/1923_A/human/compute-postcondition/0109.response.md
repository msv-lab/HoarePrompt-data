Output State: **`idx` is within the range `[0, len(arrs) - 1]`, `arrs` is a list of integers created from user input, and `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. Since `idx` and `arrs` remain unchanged, they retain their initial conditions. Therefore, `idx` is still within the range `[0, len(arrs) - 1]`, `arrs` remains a list of integers created from user input, and `cnt0` is now one more than its original value.
