Output State: **`cnt0` is 0, `_` is 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The line `cnt0 = 0` initializes the variable `cnt0` to 0. The values of `_` and `length` remain unchanged, and `arrs` retains its original state as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
