Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is an integer and is not equal to 0, and the first element of `arrs` is 0, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the variable `cnt0` by 1. Initially, `cnt0` was not specified, but since it is incremented by 1, its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
