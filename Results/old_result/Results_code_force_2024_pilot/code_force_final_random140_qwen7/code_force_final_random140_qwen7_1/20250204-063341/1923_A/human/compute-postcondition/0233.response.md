Output State: **`idx` is the length of `arrs`, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`, the first element of `arrs` is 0, the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1 if the last element of `arrs` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `idx`, `cnt1`, the first and last elements of `arrs`, or `cnt0`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
