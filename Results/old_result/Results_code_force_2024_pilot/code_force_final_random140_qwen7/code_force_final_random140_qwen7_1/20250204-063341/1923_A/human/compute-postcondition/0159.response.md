Output State: **`cnt1` is either 5 or 4, `idx` is 8, `cnt0` is `cnt0 - 1` if `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, `ans` is `cnt0`, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = cnt0` assigns the value of `cnt0` to `ans`. The values of `cnt1`, `idx`, `arrs`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `cnt0` changing (`cnt0 - 1` if `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]` is 1) is still applicable.
