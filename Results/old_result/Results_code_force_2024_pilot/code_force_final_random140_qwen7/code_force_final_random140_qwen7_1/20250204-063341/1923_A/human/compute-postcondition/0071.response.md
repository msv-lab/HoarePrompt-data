Output State: **`cnt0` is decreased by 1, `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs`, `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`, and `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes `ans` to 0, which does not affect the values of `cnt0`, `idx`, or `cnt1`. The last element of `arrs` being 0 is mentioned as a postcondition, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the preconditions and the new value of `ans`.
