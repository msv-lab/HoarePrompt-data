Output State: **`arrs` is a list of integers, `idx` is the previous `idx` plus 1, `cnt1` is the previous `cnt1` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt1 += 1` increments the value of `cnt1` by 1. The values of `arrs` and `idx` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `cnt1` is updated to its previous value plus 1, while `arrs` and `idx` retain their initial conditions.
