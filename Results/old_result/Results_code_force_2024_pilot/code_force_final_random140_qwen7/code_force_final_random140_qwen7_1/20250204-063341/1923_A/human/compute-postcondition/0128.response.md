Output State: **`cnt1` is 0, `idx` is equal to `len(arrs)`, `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs` except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0, `ans` retains its initial value based on the final `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `t` is decremented by the number of iterations which is `len(arrs)`**.

Explanation:
- `cnt1` is initialized to 0.
- The value of `idx` remains unchanged as it was already set to `len(arrs)`.
- `cnt0` retains its initial value based on the final count of 0s encountered in `arrs`, except when `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is 0.
- `ans` retains its initial value based on the final counts of 0s (`cnt0`) and 1s (`cnt1`).
- `t` is decremented by the number of iterations, which is `len(arrs)`.
