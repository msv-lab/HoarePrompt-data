Output State: **`idx` is within the range [0, len(arrs) - 1], `arrs` is a list of integers created from user input, and `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. Since `idx` and `arrs` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx` is still within the range `[0, len(arrs) - 1]`, `arrs` remains a list of integers created from user input, and `cnt0` is increased by 1.
