Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, and `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `arrs`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `length` remain unchanged.
