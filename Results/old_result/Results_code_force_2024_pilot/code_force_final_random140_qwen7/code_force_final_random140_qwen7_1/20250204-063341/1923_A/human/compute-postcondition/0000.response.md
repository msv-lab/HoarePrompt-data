Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip; the number of consecutive 0s between the nearest 1s on both ends of the array is the answer.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is a comment block and does not contain any executable statements that would modify the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged. The goal is to find the number of consecutive 0s between the nearest 1s on both ends of the array, which is not computed in the given code but is described in the comments.
