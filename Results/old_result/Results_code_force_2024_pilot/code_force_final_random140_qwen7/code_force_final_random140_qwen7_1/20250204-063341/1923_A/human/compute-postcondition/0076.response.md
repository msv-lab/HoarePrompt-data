Output State: **`cnt0` is decreased by 1; `idx` is equal to the length of `arrs`; `cnt1` is the total count of 1s in `arrs`; and `ans` is `cnt0`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `cnt0` to `ans`. Since `cnt0` was initially decreased by 1, `ans` now holds this updated value. The other variables (`idx`, `cnt1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
