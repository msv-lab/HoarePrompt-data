Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables `x` and `list_len`. Therefore, we need to focus on these variables.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `x < int(list_len)`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0, and `list_len` is a non-empty string that can be converted to an integer.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `x` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `list_len` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state should reflect the updated value of `x` and the unchanged value of `list_len`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`x` is 1, `list_len` is a non-empty string that can be converted to an integer**
