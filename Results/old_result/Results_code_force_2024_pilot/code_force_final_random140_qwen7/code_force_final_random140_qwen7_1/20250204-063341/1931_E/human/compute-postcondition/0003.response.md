Output State: **`y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the length of each string after removing trailing zeros.**

Explanation: The code takes an input, splits it into a list of strings, and sorts this list based on the length of each string after removing any trailing zeros. The original values of `y`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, and `max_power` remain unchanged. The new variable `operational_list` is created and contains the sorted list of strings.
