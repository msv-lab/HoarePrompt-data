Output State: **`x` is 0, `rev_res` is the value of `operational_list[0].rstrip('0')`, `list_len` is a non-empty string that can be converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code updates `rev_res` by adding the result of `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`. Given that `x` is initially 0, `rev_res` is updated to include the value of `operational_list[0]` with trailing zeros removed. The other variables (`list_len` and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
