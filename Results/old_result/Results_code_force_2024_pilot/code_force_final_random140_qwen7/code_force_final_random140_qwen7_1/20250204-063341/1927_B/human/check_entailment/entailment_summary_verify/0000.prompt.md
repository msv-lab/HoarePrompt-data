You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, a)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, a):
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
    a_map = {x: 0 for x in range(n)}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        beg = a_map[a[i]]
        res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
    return res



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It constructs and returns a string `res` by iterating over the range of `n`, where for each index `i`, the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` is appended to `res`. The function also updates a dictionary `a_map` to keep track of the count of occurrences of each index in the list `a` throughout the loop's iterations. The final state of the program includes the constructed string `res` and the updated dictionary `a_map`, while the original lists `a` and the string `sam` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate a string based on the given trace. Specifically, the program always uses the same set of characters ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz') and cycles through them, which does not guarantee that the generated string will match the trace requirements. 

For example, consider the trace `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`. The program generates `abracadabra`, but this string does not satisfy the trace because the fourth character 'r' should appear after the third character 'a', but in the generated string, 'r' appears before 'a'. 

A correct implementation would ensure that the character at position `i` in the generated string appears after the positions specified in the trace. The current implementation does not account for this requirement, leading to incorrect results for certain traces.
