Output State: **`i` is 1, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value, `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]]`, `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a_map[a[i]]` by 1. Since `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. The values of `i`, `res`, `beg`, and `a_map[a[i]]` are updated accordingly. The initial values of `res` and `beg` are derived from `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` and `a_map[a[0]]`, respectively, and these expressions remain unchanged in the output state.
