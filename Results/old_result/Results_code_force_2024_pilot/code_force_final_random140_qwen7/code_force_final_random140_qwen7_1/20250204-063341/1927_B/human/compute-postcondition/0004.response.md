Output State: **`i` is 0; `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a_map[a[i]]` to the variable `beg`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Therefore, `beg` is set to the value of `a_map[a[0]]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
