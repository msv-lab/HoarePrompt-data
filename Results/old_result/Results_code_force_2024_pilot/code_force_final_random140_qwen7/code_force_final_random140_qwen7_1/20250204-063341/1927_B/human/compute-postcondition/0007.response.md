Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value.
   - `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]]`.
   - `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` will be 2 in the next iteration).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `res` will be updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value.
   - `beg` will remain `a_map[a[0]]` (since it is not modified in the loop).
   - `a_map[a[i]]` will be increased by 1, where `i` is now 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value, `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]]`, `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1, and `n` must be greater than 2**.
