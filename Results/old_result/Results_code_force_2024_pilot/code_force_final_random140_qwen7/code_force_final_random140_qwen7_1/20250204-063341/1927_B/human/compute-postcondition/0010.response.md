Output State: **`i` is 3, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value, `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]] + 1`, `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1, `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a_map[a[i]]` by 1. Given that `i` is 3, this means `a_map[a[3]]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
