Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, a)
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where each element a_i represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the current index.
def func_1(n, a):
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
    a_map = {x: (0) for x in range(n)}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        beg = a_map[a[i]]
        
        res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]
        
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `res` will be a string constructed by adding `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` for each iteration, `a_map` will map each key from 0 to n-1 to its final value which is the number of times it was incremented during the loop, and `a` and `sam` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #In more detail, `res` will contain characters from the string 'sam' based on the modulo operation with 27, and the length of `res` will be equal to `n`. Each character in `a_map` will reflect the total count of occurrences of the corresponding index in the list `a` throughout the loop's iterations.
    return res
    #The program returns a string `res` constructed by iterating over the range of `n`, where for each index `i`, the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` is appended to `res`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It constructs and returns a string `res` by iterating over the range of `n`, where for each index `i`, the character `sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` is appended to `res`. The function also updates a dictionary `a_map` to keep track of the count of occurrences of each index in the list `a` throughout the loop's iterations. The final state of the program includes the constructed string `res` and the updated dictionary `a_map`, while the original lists `a` and the string `sam` remain unchanged.
