Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value.
   - `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]] + 1`.
   - `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1.
   - `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **State the new state**:
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `res`, `beg`, `a_map[a[2]]`, and `a_map[a[i]]` remain as they were because these variables are not directly affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 4, `res` is updated by adding `sam[a_map[a[0]] % 27]` to its current value, `beg` is equal to `a_map[a[0]] + 1`, `a_map[a[2]]` is increased by 1, `a_map[a[i]]` is increased by 1.**
