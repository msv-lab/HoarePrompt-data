Postcondition: `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the `password` string, and `results` remains 'NO'. If either `letters` is not sorted alphabetically or `digits` is not sorted numerically, the condition is met.
