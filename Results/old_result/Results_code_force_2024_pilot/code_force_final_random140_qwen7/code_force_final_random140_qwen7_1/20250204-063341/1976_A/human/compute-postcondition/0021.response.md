Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over each character `ch` in the string `password`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `ch`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - If `ch` is an alphabet, it is added to `letters`.
   - If `ch` is a digit, it is considered as a digit in the password.
   - If `ch` is neither an alphabet nor a digit, no change is made.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through each character of `password`, the variable `ch` will be the next character in the string `password`.
   - The postcondition states that `password` must contain at least one character. This means that even if the next character is not an alphabet or a digit, the condition still holds.

Given the above points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `password` must contain at least one character (this condition is already satisfied).
- `ch` will be the next character in the `password`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`password` must contain at least one character, `ch` is the next character in the password**
