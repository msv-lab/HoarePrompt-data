### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and each password along with its length `n`. This part is handled well in the loop where it collects the necessary data into `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the parsed test cases and stores the results in the `results` list. This is done correctly.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: It initializes two empty strings, `letters` and `digits`, to store the letters and digits from the password.
   - **Separation of Characters**: It iterates through each character in the password and appends it to either `letters` or `digits` based on whether it is a letter or a digit.
   - **Sorting Check**: It checks if the sorted versions of `letters` and `digits` match the original strings. If they don't, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
   - **Order Check**: If both `letters` and `digits` are non-empty, it checks if the last letter appears before the first digit in the password. If this condition is violated, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
   - **Result Append**: If none of the conditions fail, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case as required.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified criteria.

### Correctness:
**True**
