Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ch`.

2. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `letters` is a string that either contains the character `ch` (if `ch` is alphabetic) or is empty (if `ch` is not alphabetic).
   - `digits` is a string that either contains the character `ch` (if `ch` is a digit) or is empty (if `ch` is not a digit).
   - `results` remains 'NO'.
   - `ch` is the next character in the `password` string.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ch` is the next character in the `password` string, for the next iteration, `ch` will be the character following the current one.
   - The strings `letters` and `digits` will be updated based on the new value of `ch`.
   - `results` will remain 'NO' unless there is a specific condition within the loop body that changes it, but since no such condition is mentioned, it stays 'NO'.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `letters` will be updated based on the new value of `ch`.
- `digits` will be updated based on the new value of `ch`.
- `results` remains 'NO'.
- `ch` will be the next character in the `password` string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`letters` is a string that either contains the character `ch` (if `ch` is alphabetic) or is empty (if `ch` is not alphabetic), `digits` is a string that either contains the character `ch` (if `ch` is a digit) or is empty (if `ch` is not a digit), `results` remains 'NO', and `ch` is the next character in the `password` string.**
