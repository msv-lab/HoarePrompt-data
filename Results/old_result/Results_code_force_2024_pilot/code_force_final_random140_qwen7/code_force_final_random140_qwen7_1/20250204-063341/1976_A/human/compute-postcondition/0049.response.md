Postcondition: `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is the string containing the digit `ch`, and `results` is 'NO', if `ch` is a digit. Otherwise, `letters`, `digits`, and `results` remain as initially defined (empty string, empty string, and 'NO'), since no changes are made when `ch` is not a digit.
