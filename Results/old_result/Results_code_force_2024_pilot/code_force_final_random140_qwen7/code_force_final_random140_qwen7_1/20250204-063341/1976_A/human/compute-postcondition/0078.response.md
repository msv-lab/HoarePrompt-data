Postcondition: `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the `password` string, and `results` is ['NO']. If either `letters` is not sorted, `digits` is not sorted, or the last character of `letters` appears earlier in the `password` string than the first character of `digits`, then `results` becomes ['NO', 'YES']. Otherwise, `results` remains ['NO'].
