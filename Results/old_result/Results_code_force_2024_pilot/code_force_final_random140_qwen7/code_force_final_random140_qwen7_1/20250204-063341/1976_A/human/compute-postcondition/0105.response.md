Postcondition: `ch` is the next character in the updated `password`, `password` is the original `password` minus its first character, `letters` is updated based on the new value of `ch` if `ch` is an alphabetic character (updated by adding the value of `ch` to its current value if `ch` is alphabetic), and `digits` is updated by adding the value of `ch` to its current value if `ch` is a digit (increased by the value of `ch` if `ch` is a digit).
