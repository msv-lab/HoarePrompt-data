Output State: **`letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all iterations, `letters` will hold every alphabetic character found in the `password` string, concatenated in the order they appeared. Similarly, `digits` will hold every numeric character found in the `password` string, also concatenated in the order they appeared. The `password` string itself is not explicitly mentioned in the final state since it's the source of characters for `letters` and `digits`.
