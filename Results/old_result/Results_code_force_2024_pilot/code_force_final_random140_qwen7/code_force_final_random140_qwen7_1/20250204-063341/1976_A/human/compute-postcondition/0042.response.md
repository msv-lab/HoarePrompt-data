Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. This means the loop will iterate over each character in the `password` string, assigning each character to the variable `ch`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `ch`: This variable will take on the value of each character in the `password` string during each iteration.
   - `password`: This is the string over which the loop will iterate.

3. **Identify the other variables mentioned in the problem**:
   - `letters`: An empty string.
   - `digits`: An empty string.
   - `results`: A string set to 'NO'.
   - `n`: A variable whose initial state is given as `n + 1`, but since `n` is not used within the loop head, its initial value does not affect the loop's execution.

4. **Determine if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the `password` string is not empty. If `password` is empty, the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on the `password` string, we need to ensure that `password` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `password` must not be an empty string.

Putting it all together:

**State: **`letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string, `results` is 'NO', `password` must not be an empty string**
