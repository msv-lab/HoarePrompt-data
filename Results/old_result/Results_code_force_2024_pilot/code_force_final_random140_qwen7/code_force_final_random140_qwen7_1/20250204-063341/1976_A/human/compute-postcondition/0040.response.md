Output State: **`letters` is an empty string, `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`, `results` is 'NO' if the last alphabetic character in `letters` comes after the first numeric character in `digits` according to their positions in `password`. Otherwise, `results` is 'YES', `n` is `n + 1`, and `password` is the same as in the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `letters = ''` sets the variable `letters` to an empty string. All other variables (`digits`, `results`, `n`, and `password`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
