### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and each password along with its length `n`. This part is handled well in the loop where it collects the necessary data into `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the parsed test cases and stores the results in the `results` list. This is done correctly.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: It initializes two empty strings, `letters` and `digits`, to store the letters and digits from the password.
   - **Separation of Characters**: It iterates through each character in the password and appends it to either `letters` or `digits` based on whether it is a letter or a digit.
   - **Sorting Check**: It checks if the sorted versions of `letters` and `digits` match the original strings. If they don't, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
   - **Order Check**: If both `letters` and `digits` are non-empty, it checks if the last letter appears before the first digit in the password. If this condition is violated, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
   - **Result Append**: If none of the conditions fail, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case as required.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a flaw in the order check. Specifically, the condition `if letters and digits and (password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])):` is not sufficient to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. This condition only checks if the last letter appears before the first digit, but it does not ensure that no digit comes after a letter anywhere in the password.

To illustrate, consider the password "123abc". According to the current implementation, this password would be considered strong because the last letter 'c' appears before the first digit '1'. However, the password violates the rule that no digit should come after a letter.

A correct implementation would need to iterate through the password and ensure that no digit comes after a letter at any point in the string. Here is a revised version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        digits = ''
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        # Ensure no digit comes after a letter
        has_letter = False
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                has_letter = True
            elif has_letter:
                results.append('NO')
                break
        else:
            results.append('YES')
    return results
```

With this correction, the function will properly check that no digit comes after a letter at any point in the password.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate due to the flaw in the order check. The program needs to be corrected to ensure that no digit comes after a letter at any point in the password.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
