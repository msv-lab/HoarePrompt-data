Output State: **`letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password`, `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`, and `results` is ['YES']**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` is set to `'NO'`, which is represented as a string. After appending `'YES'`, `results` becomes a list containing `'YES'`. The contents of `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged from their initial states.
