Output State: **results is a list containing either 'NO', 'NO' or 'NO', 'YES' for each iteration.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain either 'NO', 'NO' for each pair of test cases if the conditions specified in the loop are not met for both passwords, or 'NO', 'YES' if the conditions are met for at least one of the passwords in any given pair. The `letters` and `digits` strings will contain all the alphabetic and numeric characters from the respective passwords, respectively, but their order within the `results` list will reflect whether the conditions were satisfied for each password in the test cases.
