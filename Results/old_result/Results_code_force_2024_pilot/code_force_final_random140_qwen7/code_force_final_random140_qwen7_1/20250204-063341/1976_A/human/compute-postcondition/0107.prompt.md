Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `letters` is '', `digits` is '', `results` is ['NO'], `n` is the next value of `n` from `test_cases`, `password` is the corresponding `password` value from `test_cases`
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ch` is either an alphabetic character or a digit, and `password` contains at least one character. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, then `letters` is equal to `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is the concatenation of `ch`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ch` is the next character in `password`, `password` is the original `password` minus the first character, `letters` is updated based on the previous value of `ch` if `ch` was an alphabetic character, and `digits` is updated by adding the value of `ch` to its current value if `ch` is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ch` is the next character in the updated `password`, `password` is the original `password` minus its first character, `letters` is updated based on the new value of `ch` if `ch` is an alphabetic character, and `digits` is updated by adding the value of `ch` to its current value if `ch` is a digit. Specifically, if `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is incremented by the value of `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is incremented by the value of `ch`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
