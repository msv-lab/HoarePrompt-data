Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', 'YES', `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password`, and `digits` contains all the digits from the `password`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contained `'NO'`, after appending `'YES'`, `results` now contains both `'NO'` and `'YES'`. The lists `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The condition about the last letter in `letters` and the first digit in `digits` also remains valid.
