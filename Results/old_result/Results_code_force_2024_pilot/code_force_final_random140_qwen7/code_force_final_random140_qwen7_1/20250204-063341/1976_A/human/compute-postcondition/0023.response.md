Output State: **`password` must contain at least one character; `digits` is equal to `password` + `ch`.**

Explanation: The variable `digits` is assigned the value of `ch`, which is the next character in the password. The initial state of `password` must contain at least one character, and now `digits` includes this character plus the new `ch`.
