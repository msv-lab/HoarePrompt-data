Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `digits` and assigns it an empty string. This does not affect the values of `results`, `test_cases`, or `letters`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
