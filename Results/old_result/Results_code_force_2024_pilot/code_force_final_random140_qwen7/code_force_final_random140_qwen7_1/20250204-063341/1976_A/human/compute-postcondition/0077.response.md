Postcondition: `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the `password` string, and `results` is either ['NO'] or ['NO', 'YES']. If the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` string than the first character of `digits`, `results` remains ['NO']. Otherwise, either `letters` is not sorted, `digits` is not sorted, or the last character of `letters` comes before or at the same position as the first character of `digits` within the `password` string, in which case `results` becomes ['NO', 'YES'].
