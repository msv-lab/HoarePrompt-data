Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character. If the current character `ch` is an alphabetic character, then `letters` is equal to `ch`. If the current character `ch` is a digit, then `password` does not consist of any alphabetic characters and `digits` now contains this digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character. If the next character `ch` in `password` is an alphabet, then `ch` is added to `letters`. If the next character `ch` in `password` is a digit, then `ch` is considered as a digit in the password. If `ch` is neither an alphabet nor a digit, no change is made to the password regarding the next character being a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `password` must contain at least one character. If `ch` is an alphabet, then `letters` is equal to `password` plus the next character `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is equal to `password` plus `ch`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
