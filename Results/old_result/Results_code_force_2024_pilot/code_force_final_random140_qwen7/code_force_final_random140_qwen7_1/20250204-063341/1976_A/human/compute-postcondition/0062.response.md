Postcondition: `letters` is a string that either contains the character `ch` (if `ch` is alphabetic) or is empty (if `ch` is not alphabetic), `digits` is the string `ch` appended to the previous value of `digits`, and `results` remains 'NO', given that `ch` is the next character in the `password` string.
