Output State: **`results` contains 'NO', `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from the `password`, and `digits` contains all the digits from the `password`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially unchanged and did not contain any elements, after appending `'NO'`, it now contains only `'NO'`. The lists `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
