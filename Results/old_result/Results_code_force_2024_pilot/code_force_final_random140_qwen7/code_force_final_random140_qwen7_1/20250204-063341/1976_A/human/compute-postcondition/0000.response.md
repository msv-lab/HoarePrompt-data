Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of strings where each string represents a password consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and each string has a length between 1 and 20 inclusive.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
