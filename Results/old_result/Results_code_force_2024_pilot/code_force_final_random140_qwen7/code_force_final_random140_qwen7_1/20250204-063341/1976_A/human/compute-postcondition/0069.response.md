The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables `letters`, `digits`, and `results` remain unchanged. The precondition that either `letters` is not sorted or `digits` is not sorted also remains valid.

Output State: **`letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the `password` string, `results` is ['NO'], and either `letters` is not sorted or `digits` is not sorted.**
