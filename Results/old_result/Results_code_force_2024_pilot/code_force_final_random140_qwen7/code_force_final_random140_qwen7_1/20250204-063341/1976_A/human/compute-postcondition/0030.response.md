Output State: **`letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`; `results` contains 'NO'.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. The initial state of `letters` and `digits` remains unchanged, and now `results` contains the value `'NO'`.
