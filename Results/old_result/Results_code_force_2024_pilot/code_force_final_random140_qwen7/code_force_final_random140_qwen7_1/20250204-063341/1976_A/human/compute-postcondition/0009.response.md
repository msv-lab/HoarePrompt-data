Output State: **`password` must contain at least one character, and the password does not consist of any alphabetic characters; `digits` now contains the digit from the password.**

Explanation: The code `digits += ch` adds the character `ch` (which is a digit) to the variable `digits`. The precondition that the password does not consist of any alphabetic characters and must contain at least one character remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `digits` now holds the digit from the password.
