Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition where there should be no digit that comes after a letter. Specifically, consider the password `123abc`. According to the problem description, this password should be classified as "NO" because there is a digit (`3`) that comes after a letter (`a`). However, the current implementation does not check for this condition properly. The code checks if the letters and digits are sorted separately and if the last letter comes before the first digit, but it does not ensure that no digit appears after a letter throughout the entire string. Therefore, the program will incorrectly classify `123abc` as "YES".
