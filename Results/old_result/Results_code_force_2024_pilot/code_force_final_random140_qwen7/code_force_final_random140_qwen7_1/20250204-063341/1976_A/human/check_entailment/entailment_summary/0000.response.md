Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly processes each test case by separating the characters into letters and digits.
2. It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. It also ensures that if both letters and digits are present, the last letter does not come before the first digit in the password.
4. The logic implemented in the function matches the problem description accurately.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the required conditions for verifying strong passwords.

Correctness: **True**
