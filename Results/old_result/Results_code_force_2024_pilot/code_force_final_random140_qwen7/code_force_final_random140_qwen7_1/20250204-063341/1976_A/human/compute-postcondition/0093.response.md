Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `ch`, which is iterating over each character in the string `password`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `password` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ch` is either an alphabetic character or a digit, and `password` contains at least one character. Additionally, if `ch` is an alphabetic character, then `letters` is equal to `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is the concatenation of `ch`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ch` is iterating through each character in `password`, the next character in `password` will be the focus of the next iteration.
   - `password` will lose its first character since it is being iterated over.
   - `ch` will be the next character in `password`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `password` will now be the remaining part of the original `password` string, excluding the first character.
   - `ch` will be the next character in `password`.
   - If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` will be updated accordingly.
   - If `ch` is a digit, `digits` will be updated accordingly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `password` will be the original `password` string minus the first character.
- `ch` will be the next character in `password`.

Since no information about the specific value of `ch` is given, we can't specify the exact value of `ch`, but we know it will be the next character in `password`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ch` is the next character in `password`, `password` is the original `password` minus the first character, `letters` is updated based on the previous value of `ch` if `ch` was an alphabetic character, and `digits` is updated based on the previous value of `ch` if `ch` was a digit**.
