Output State: **`password` must contain at least one character; `letters` now contains the character `ch`.**

Explanation: The code `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the variable `letters`. Since `ch` is the next character in the `password` string, `letters` now includes this character. The precondition that `password` must contain at least one character remains unchanged.
