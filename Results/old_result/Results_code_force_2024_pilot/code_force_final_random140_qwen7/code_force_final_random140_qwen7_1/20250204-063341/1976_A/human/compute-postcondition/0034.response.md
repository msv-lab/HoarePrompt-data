Output State: **`results` is ['NO']**

The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. Initially, `results` is set to 'NO', which means it is a string. After appending 'NO' to it, `results` becomes a list containing one element, which is 'NO'. The states of the other variables (`letters` and `digits`) remain unchanged. The last character of `letters` appearing later in the `password` than the first character of `digits` is also still true.
