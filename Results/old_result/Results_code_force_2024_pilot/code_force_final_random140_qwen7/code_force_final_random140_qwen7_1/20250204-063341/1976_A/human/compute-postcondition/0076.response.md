Output State: **`letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the `password` string, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the `password` string, and `results` is ['NO', 'YES']. Either `letters` is not sorted or `digits` is not sorted, or the last letter in `letters` comes before or at the same position as the first digit in `digits` within the `password` string.**

Explanation: The code appends 'YES' to the list `results`. Initially, `results` was 'NO'. After appending 'YES', `results` becomes a list containing both 'NO' and 'YES'. The other variables (`letters` and `digits`) remain unchanged.
