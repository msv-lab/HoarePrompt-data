Output State: **`ch` is the next character in `password`, `password` is the original `password` minus the first character, `letters` is updated by adding the value of `ch` to it, and `digits` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `letters += ch` adds the value of `ch` to the `letters` variable. The other variables (`ch`, `password`, and `digits`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
