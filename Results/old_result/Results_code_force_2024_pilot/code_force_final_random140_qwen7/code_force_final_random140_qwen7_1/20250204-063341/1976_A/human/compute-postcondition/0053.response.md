Output State: **`letters` is now the original string plus `ch`, `digits` remains an empty string, `results` remains 'NO', and `ch` is the next character in the `password` string.**

Explanation: The code `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `letters`. Since `digits` and `results` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. The value of `ch` also remains the same as it was before the operation.
