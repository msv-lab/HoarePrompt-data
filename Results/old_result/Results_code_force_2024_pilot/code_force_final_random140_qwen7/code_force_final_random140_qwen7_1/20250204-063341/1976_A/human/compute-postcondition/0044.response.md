Output State: **`letters` is now the string containing the character `ch`, `digits` is an empty string, `results` is 'NO', and `password` is not an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `letters`. Since `ch` is alphabetic, it is added to `letters`. The other variables (`digits`, `results`, and `password`) remain unchanged.
