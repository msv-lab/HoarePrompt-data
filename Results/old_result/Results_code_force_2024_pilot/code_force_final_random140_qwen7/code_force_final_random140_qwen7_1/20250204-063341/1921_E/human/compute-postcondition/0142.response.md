Output State: **`i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `answers` is a list with one element 'Alice'**.

The code appends the string 'Alice' to the list `answers`. Since `answers` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new list created by this operation. The values of `i`, `test_cases`, and `clues` remain unchanged from their initial states.
