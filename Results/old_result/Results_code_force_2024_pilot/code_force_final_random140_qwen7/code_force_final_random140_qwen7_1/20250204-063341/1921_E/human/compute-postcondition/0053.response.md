Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is odd, `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y1` is `y2 - a`, `y2` is 1, `c` is `y1 - 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `c` has been updated to `y1 - 1`. All other variables retain their original conditions and relationships from the initial state.
