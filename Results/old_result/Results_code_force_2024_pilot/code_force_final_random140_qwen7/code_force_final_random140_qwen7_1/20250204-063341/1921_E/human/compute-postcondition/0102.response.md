Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y1` is either 1 or `m`, `y2` is adjusted by `a` (either increased or decreased depending on the initial value of `y1`), `x2` is decreased by `a`, and `x2` is still greater than or equal to `x1`.
