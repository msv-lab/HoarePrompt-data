Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, and `x2` is equal to `r[4]`. The difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2` because `y1` is either incremented by 1 or decremented by 1 depending on whether `y2` is greater than `y1` or not, but in this case, the condition `y1 == y2` is false.
