Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, and `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`; otherwise, `a` is equal to `m - y1`, `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`**.

This means that `x1` has been increased by the value of `a`. The other variables retain their initial conditions or expressions derived from the initial state.
