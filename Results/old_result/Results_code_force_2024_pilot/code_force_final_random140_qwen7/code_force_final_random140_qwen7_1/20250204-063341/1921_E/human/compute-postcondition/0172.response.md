Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six positive integers representing dimensions and positions (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). Based on specific conditions involving these integers, the function determines and appends one of three outcomes ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') to a list. After processing all test cases, the function prints each outcome in the list exactly once.**
