Reasoning:
The given program is intended to determine the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob based on their initial positions on a checkered board. The program reads the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, then determines the winner or if the game ends in a draw based on specific conditions.

However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the program:

1. **Function `func_1` is not complete**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly within the main loop. Instead, it should be called inside the loop that processes each test case.

2. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For instance, it does not properly account for all possible moves and winning conditions.

3. **Logic errors**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. For example, the condition checks for `if (x2 - x1) % 2 != 0` and subsequent logic are not fully implemented to cover all scenarios where Alice or Bob can win.

4. **Return statements are misplaced**: The return statements are placed inappropriately, which can lead to incorrect outputs or premature termination of the function.

5. **Incomplete implementation**: The function does not fully implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the rules provided.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the outcome of the game according to the provided problem description.

Correctness: **False**
