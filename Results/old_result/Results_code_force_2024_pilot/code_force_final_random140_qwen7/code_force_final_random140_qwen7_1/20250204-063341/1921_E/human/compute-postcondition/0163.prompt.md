Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4; `answers` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
    elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
        if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
        if clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. If either the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues` or the first element of `clues` is equal to 1, `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, depending on the conditions specified, `answers` will contain either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. Specifically, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, and based on the comparison between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`, `answers` will contain 'Bob' if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, or 'Draw' under certain conditions involving `clues[1]`, `clues[2]`, `clues[3]`, `clues[4]`, and `clues[5]`. If the if condition is not met, `answers` will contain either 'Alice', 'Draw', or ['Alice'] based on the comparison of `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`, along with the conditions involving other elements in `clues`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. Depending on the conditions of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. Specifically:
- If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, then `answers` is a list with 'Draw' appended.
- Otherwise, depending on the conditions of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' is appended to `answers` as follows:
  - If `clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0` or `(clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)`:
    - If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.
    - If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`; otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.
  - Otherwise:
    - If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
    - If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
    - If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
    - If `clues[3] >= clues[5]`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `answers` is a list with one element determined as follows:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
