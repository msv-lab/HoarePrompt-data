Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2]`.
- `y1` is equal to `r[3]`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]`.
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
- The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`.

The `print('draw')` statement will print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **'draw'**
