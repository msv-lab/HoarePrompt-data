Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, and `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is odd.**

Explanation: The code `b = x2 - x1` assigns the value of `x2 - x1` to the variable `b`. Since the difference `(x2 - x1)` is already stated to be odd, `b` will also be an odd number. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
