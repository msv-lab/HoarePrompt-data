### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the outcome of the game based on the given rules and the initial positions of the chips. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the dimensions of the board (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`).

2. **Game Outcome Determination**:
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is initially above Alice's chip (`x2 <= x1`). If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Bob cannot catch Alice if he starts above her.
   - If Bob's chip is not above Alice's chip, the program further checks if the vertical distance between the two chips is odd. If it is, Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally to get closer to Bob's chip.
   - If the vertical distance is even, the program checks if Alice can force a win by moving vertically to get closer to Bob's chip.

3. **Detailed Logic Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the chips are in the same row but different columns.
   - It correctly calculates the necessary moves for Alice and Bob to either catch each other or force a draw.
   - The logic for adjusting the positions of the chips and checking the conditions to determine the winner is well-implemented.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
   - It ensures that the moves stay within the boundaries of the board.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct in determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints.

**Correctness: **True**
