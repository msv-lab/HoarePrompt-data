Based on the initial state and the conditions provided, let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
   - `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
   - `x1` is increased by `a`.
   - `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`.
   - `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `y1` is adjusted to either 1 or `m` depending on the condition.
   - `y2` is adjusted accordingly (either decreased by `a` or increased by `a`).
   - `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
   - `a` is calculated as `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1` or `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`.
   - `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.
   - The condition `(b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c and (1 <= y1 <= m) and (1 <= x1 <= n))` is false.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since the condition `(b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c and (1 <= y1 <= m) and (1 <= x1 <= n))` is false, at least one part of this condition must be false.
   - Given the complexity of the condition, it implies that the values of `b`, `a`, `x2`, `c`, `y1`, and `y2` do not satisfy the condition.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('draw')`.

Given these observations, the print statement will execute and print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
