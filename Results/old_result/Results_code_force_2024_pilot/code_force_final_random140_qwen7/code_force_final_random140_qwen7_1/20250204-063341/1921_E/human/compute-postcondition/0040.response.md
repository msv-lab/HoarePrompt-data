Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is odd, `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`.**

This means that the value of `t` is now updated to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
