Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, extracting the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**: 
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is initially at a lower or equal row compared to Alice's chip. If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Bob cannot win in this scenario.
   - If Bob's chip is in a higher row, the program proceeds to further analysis.

3. **Odd and Even Distance Analysis**:
   - If the vertical distance between the two chips is odd, the program checks if Alice can force a win. This is done by ensuring that Alice can move to a position where she can capture Bob's chip.
   - If the vertical distance is even, the program checks if Bob can force a win similarly.

4. **Detailed Moves Analysis**:
   - The program handles various scenarios where Alice and Bob can move their chips. It ensures that the moves are within the board boundaries.
   - The program also checks if Alice or Bob can force a win by moving to a position where they can capture the opponent's chip.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board, which would result in a draw if no winning move is available.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct outcome ("Alice", "Bob", or "Draw") based on the analysis.

Given the detailed analysis above, the program appears to handle the problem correctly according to the rules and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
