Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, `y1` is 1, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `a` is equal to `m - y1` because `y2` is less than `y1`, `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, the absolute difference between `y1 - 1` is less than the absolute difference between `y1 - m`.**

Explanation: The code `y1 = 1` assigns the value 1 to `y1`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
