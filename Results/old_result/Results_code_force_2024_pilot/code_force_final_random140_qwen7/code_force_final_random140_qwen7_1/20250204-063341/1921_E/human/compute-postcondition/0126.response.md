Output State: **`i` is 3, `test_cases` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `answers` is a list with one element 'Bob'**.

Explanation: The line `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`i`, `test_cases`, and `clues`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
