Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Additionally, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`.
