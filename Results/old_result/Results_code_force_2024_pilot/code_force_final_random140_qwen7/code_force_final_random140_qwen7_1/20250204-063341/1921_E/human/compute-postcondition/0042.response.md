Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is odd, `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`.**

Explanation: The code `x2 -= a` subtracts the value of `a` from `x2`. Since `x2` was originally equal to `r[4]`, after executing the code, `x2` becomes `r[4] - a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
