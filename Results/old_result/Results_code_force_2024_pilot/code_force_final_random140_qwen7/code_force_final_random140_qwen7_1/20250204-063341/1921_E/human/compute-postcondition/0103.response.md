Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y1` is adjusted to either 1 or `m` depending on the condition, `y2` is adjusted accordingly (either decreased by `a` or increased by `a`), `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `a` is calculated as `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1` or `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, and `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.
