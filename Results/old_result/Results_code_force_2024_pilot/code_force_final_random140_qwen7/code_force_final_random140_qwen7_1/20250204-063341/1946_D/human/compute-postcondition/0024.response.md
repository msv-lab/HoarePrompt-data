Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` has `xor` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code sets `xor` to 0, which overrides its previous value. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
