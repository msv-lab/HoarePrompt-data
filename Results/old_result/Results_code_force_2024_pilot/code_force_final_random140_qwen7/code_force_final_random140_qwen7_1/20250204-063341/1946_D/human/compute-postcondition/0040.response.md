Output State: **The program returns the result of calling `find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)` where `new_arr` contains all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration where `xor` had the bit at position `bit` set to 1, and `bit` is decremented by 1.**

This means that the function `find_new` is called with two arguments: `new_arr`, which is a list containing specific values of `xor` based on the bit positions, and `bit - 1`, which is the bit position decremented by 1 from its original value.
