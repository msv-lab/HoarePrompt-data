You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `find_new` does not properly handle the constraints and conditions described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**: The function `find_new` attempts to split the array into segments based on a specific bit position. However, it does not ensure that the segments meet the required conditions (i.e., the XOR of each segment must be less than or equal to `x`).

2. **Bitwise Operations**: The function uses bitwise operations to check and manipulate the segments, but it does not correctly compute the XOR of the segments or ensure that the segments are valid according to the problem constraints.

3. **Recursive Approach**: The recursive approach in `find_new` is not designed to handle the cumulative XOR condition across multiple segments. It only checks individual segments based on a single bit position, which is insufficient to determine the maximum number of valid segments.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array might contain elements that cannot form valid segments under the given constraints. For example, if the array contains elements that do not allow forming segments with XOR values within the limit `x`, the program should return `-1`.

Here is an example where the program fails to produce the correct result:

Consider the input:
```
3 2
0 0 1
```

- The expected output is `3` because we can form three segments `[1, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, and `[3, 3]` such that the XOR of each segment is `0`, which is less than or equal to `2`.
- However, the provided program will incorrectly return `-1` because it does not correctly handle the cumulative XOR condition across multiple segments.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is `False`.
