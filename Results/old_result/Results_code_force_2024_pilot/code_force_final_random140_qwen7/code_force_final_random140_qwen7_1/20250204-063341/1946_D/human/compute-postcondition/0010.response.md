Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, and the current value of `(not xor >> bit & 1)` is True**

Explanation: The line `xor = 0` sets the variable `xor` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
