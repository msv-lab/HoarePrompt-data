Postcondition: `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`, `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` has `xor` appended to it if `xor` does not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1.
