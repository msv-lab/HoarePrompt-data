Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-overlapping subarrays such that the cumulative XOR of each subarray does not exceed a given threshold `x`.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calls `find_new(arr, 30)`, which suggests that the function is designed to handle the entire array and consider all bits up to the 30th bit.
3. **Function `find_new`**: This function recursively processes the array by considering each bit position from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit position, it splits the array into segments where the cumulative XOR of the segment does not exceed the corresponding bit value of `x`. If the cumulative XOR exceeds the bit value of `x`, it considers the remaining segments without that bit set.
4. **Recursive Logic**: The function correctly handles the base case where `bit` is -1, returning the length of the current array. It then iterates over the array, maintaining a running XOR, and splits the array when the cumulative XOR does not exceed the current bit value of `x`. It recursively processes the remaining segments and combines their results.
5. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where no valid segments can be found by returning -1.

Given the detailed analysis, the logic implemented in both functions appears to correctly solve the problem as described. There are no apparent logical errors or missing conditions.

Correctness: **True**
