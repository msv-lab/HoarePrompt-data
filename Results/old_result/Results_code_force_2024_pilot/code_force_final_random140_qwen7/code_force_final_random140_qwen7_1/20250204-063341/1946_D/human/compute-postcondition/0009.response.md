Output State: **`xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, and the current value of `(not xor >> bit & 1)` is True**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr`. Since `new_arr` was initially an empty list, after appending `xor`, it now contains `[xor]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
