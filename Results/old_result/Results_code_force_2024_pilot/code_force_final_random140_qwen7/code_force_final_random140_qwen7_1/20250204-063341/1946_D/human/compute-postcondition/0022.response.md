Output State: **`xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`, `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the value of `i`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr`) are not affected by this operation, so they remain in their previous states.
