Postcondition: `xor` is `xor ^ i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` remains unchanged, and `cur_arr` is unchanged if `xor` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 0.
