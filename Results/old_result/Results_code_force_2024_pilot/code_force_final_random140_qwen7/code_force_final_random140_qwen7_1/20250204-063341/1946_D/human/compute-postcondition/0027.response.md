Output State: **After all iterations, `xor` will be the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, `new_arr` will contain all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration where `xor` did not have the bit at position `bit` set to 1, and `cur_arr` will be empty.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `xor` will hold the result of XORing all the elements in the initial `cur_arr`. The `new_arr` will contain all intermediate values of `xor` that met the condition of not having the bit at position `bit` set to 1 during each iteration. Additionally, the `cur_arr` will be empty since all its elements have been processed.
