Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `bit`, which is an integer representing the current bit position. The function returns the length of the list `cur_arr` if the bit position is 0. Otherwise, it returns either the maximum value between the length of a new array `new_arr` and the result of calling `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, or the result of calling `find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)` where `new_arr` contains all values of `xor` that were appended during each iteration where `xor` had the bit at position `bit` set to 1, or -1 if none of the above conditions are met.**
