Postcondition: `xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor` if `xor` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged.
