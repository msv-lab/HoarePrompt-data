Output State: **`xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`, `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` has `xor` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `new_arr.append(xor)` appends the current value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
