Postcondition: `xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit) and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, and the current value of `(not xor >> bit & 1)` is True
