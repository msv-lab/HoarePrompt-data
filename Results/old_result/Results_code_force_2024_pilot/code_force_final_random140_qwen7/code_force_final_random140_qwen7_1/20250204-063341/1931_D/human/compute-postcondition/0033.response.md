Output State: **`mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_y, mod_x]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is updated to `beautiful_count + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1` increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial postconditions. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1 while keeping the rest of the conditions intact.
