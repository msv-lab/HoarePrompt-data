Output State: **`results` now contains the current value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is now `case['array']`, `freq` remains unchanged, and `beautiful_count` is updated to the latest count, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.**
