Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**:
   - `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1`.
   - `results` is appended with 0.
   - `n` is `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is `case['params'][1]`.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `y` is `case['params'][2]`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `num` in `a`, the variable `num` will change in each iteration.
   - The variable `a` remains the same as it is defined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
   - All other variables (`beautiful_count`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `mod_x`, `y`, `mod_y`, `freq`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) depend on the value of `num` and will change based on the current value of `num`.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `num` and `a`.

4. **Determine the new state**:
   - `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `a` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1`, `results` is appended with 0, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and `num` is the next element in `a`**.
