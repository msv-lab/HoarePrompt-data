Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element; `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`.**

Explanation: The code `mod_x = num % x` calculates the modulus of `num` and `x` and assigns the result to `mod_x`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `num` and `x`, the output state only indicates that `mod_x` is the result of the modulus operation between `num` and `x`. The precondition that `a` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
