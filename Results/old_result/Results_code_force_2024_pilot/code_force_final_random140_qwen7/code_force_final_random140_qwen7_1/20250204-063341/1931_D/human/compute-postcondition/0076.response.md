Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is appended with 0, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` which is the modulus of `num` divided by `x`. However, since `num` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. But we know that `num` is derived from `n` (which is `case['params'][0]`) in some way, possibly through another part of the code. Since `num` is not explicitly defined here, `mod_x` is `num % x`, where `num` is an unspecified value derived from `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
