Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is appended with the previous `beautiful_count`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized.**

Explanation: The code initializes `beautiful_count` to 0. This means that the value of `beautiful_count` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
