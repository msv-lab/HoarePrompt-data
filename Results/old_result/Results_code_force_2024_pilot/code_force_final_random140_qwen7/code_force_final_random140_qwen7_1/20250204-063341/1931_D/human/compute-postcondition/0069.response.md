Output State: **`beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for every pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered in the list `a`, and `results` is appended with `beautiful_count`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(beautiful_count)` appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the list `results`. The value of `beautiful_count` remains unchanged after this operation, as no modification is made to it within the line itself. The other variables and their states remain as they were before the execution of this line.
