Output State: **`mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_y, mod_x]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is updated to `beautiful_count + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `mod_y`, `freq[mod_y, mod_x]`, `required_mod_x`, `beautiful_count`, and the new `required_mod_y` remain as they were before the assignment.
