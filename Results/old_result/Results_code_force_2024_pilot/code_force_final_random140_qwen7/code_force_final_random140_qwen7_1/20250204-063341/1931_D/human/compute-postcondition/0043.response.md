Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`; `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to `mod_y`. The initial state of `mod_x` remains unchanged, as it is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated `mod_y` and the unchanged `mod_x`.
