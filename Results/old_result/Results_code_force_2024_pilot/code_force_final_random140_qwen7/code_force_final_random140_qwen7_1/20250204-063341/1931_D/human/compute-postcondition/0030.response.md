Output State: **`mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_y, mod_x]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is updated to `beautiful_count + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The values of `mod_y`, `freq[mod_y, mod_x]`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their previous values. The only change is to `beautiful_count`, which is updated by adding `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to its current value.
