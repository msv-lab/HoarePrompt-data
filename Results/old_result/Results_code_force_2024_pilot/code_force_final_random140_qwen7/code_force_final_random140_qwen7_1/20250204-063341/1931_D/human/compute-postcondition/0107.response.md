Output State: **The program returns a list of integers named 'results', where each integer represents the value of 'beautiful_count' computed for each 'case' in 'test_cases'. The length of 'results' is equal to the number of cases in 'test_cases'. Each 'beautiful_count' is calculated based on the given logic involving modulus operations and frequency counting of specific (mod_x, mod_y) pairs within the array 'a'.**
