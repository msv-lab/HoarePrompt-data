Postcondition: `a` must contain at least one element. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged. `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`, `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
