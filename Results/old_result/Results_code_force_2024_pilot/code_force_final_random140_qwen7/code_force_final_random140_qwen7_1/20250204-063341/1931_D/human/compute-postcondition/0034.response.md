Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain the final value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` will remain unchanged, `n` will remain unchanged, `x` and `y` will remain unchanged, `a` will remain unchanged, `freq` will have entries for each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the loop, where `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`, and `beautiful_count` will be the sum of `beautiful_count` plus `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for every `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair that has a corresponding `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`.**

This means that after all iterations, the `results` list will store the final count of "beautiful" numbers, which is the value of `beautiful_count`. The `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` variables will retain their initial values from before the loop started. The `freq` dictionary will have keys as tuples of `(mod_x, mod_y)` and values as counts of how many times each such tuple was encountered. The `beautiful_count` will be the total count of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` that have a corresponding `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`, where `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.
