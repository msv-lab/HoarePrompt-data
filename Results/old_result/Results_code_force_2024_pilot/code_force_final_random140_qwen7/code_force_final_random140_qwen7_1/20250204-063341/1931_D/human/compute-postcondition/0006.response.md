Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for num in a:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `num`: This variable will take on the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a`: This is the list that the loop will iterate over.

3. **Check the given initial state**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `test_cases` is a non-empty list.
   - `n` is `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is `case['array']`.
   - `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over the elements in `a`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `a`. Specifically, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
