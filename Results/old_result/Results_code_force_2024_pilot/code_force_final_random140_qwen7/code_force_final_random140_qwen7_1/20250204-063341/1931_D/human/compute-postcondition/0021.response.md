Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
