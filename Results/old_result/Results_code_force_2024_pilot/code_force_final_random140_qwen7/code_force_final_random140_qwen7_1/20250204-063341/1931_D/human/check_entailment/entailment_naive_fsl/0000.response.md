Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program uses modular arithmetic to check for conditions, but it does not correctly handle the requirement that both \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Let's consider the following example to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

Hereâ€™s why the program fails:
- For the pair \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\):
  - \(a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10\) (divisible by 5)
  - \(a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8\) (divisible by 2)
- For the pair \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\):
  - \(a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10\) (divisible by 5)
  - \(a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2\) (divisible by 2)

These pairs should be counted as beautiful pairs, but the program does not count them.

The issue lies in how the program checks for the conditions. It calculates the modulus of each element with \(x\) and \(y\) and then tries to match these values with precomputed frequencies. However, this approach does not correctly account for the combined conditions of divisibility by both \(x\) and \(y\).

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check both conditions for each pair \((i, j)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append({'params': (n, x, y), 'array': a})

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        beautiful_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0 and (a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results

results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version iterates through all pairs \((i, j)\) and directly checks if both conditions are satisfied, ensuring the program works correctly according to the problem description.
