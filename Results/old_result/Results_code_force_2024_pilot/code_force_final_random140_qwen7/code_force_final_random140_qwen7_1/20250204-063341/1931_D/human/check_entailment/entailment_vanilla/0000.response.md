Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `a`.
3. It stores these values in a list of dictionaries called `test_cases`.
4. The function `func_1` processes each test case:
   - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
   - It iterates through each element `num` in the array `a` and calculates its modulus with respect to `x` and `y`.
   - It then calculates the required modulus values (`required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`) that would make the pair beautiful.
   - If the required modulus pair exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
5. After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the results list.
6. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for finding beautiful pairs in the array.

Correctness: **True**
