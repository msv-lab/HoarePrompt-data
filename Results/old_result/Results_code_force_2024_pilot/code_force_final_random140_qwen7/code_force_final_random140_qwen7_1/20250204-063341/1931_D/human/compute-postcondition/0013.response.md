Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`, `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

This means that the `beautiful_count` variable is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The other variables retain their previous values and relationships as described in the initial state.
