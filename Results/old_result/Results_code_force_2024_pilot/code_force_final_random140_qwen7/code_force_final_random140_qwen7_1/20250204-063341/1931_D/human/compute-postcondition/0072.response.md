Output State: **`case` is the next element from `test_cases`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for every pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered in the list `a`, `results` is appended with `beautiful_count`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. This means that the list `a` now holds the array specified in the current `case` dictionary under the key `'array'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
