Reasoning:  
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the correctness of the solution:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, storing the parameters and the array in a structured format.

2. **Function Definition**: The `func_1` function processes each test case individually:
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
   - It iterates through each element in the array `a`, calculates the modulus with respect to `x` and `y`, and then determines the required modulus values to form a beautiful pair.
   - If the required modulus pair exists in the frequency dictionary, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of that pair.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current modulus pair.

3. **Result Calculation**: After processing all elements in the array, the `beautiful_count` is added to the results list for that test case.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the results for each test case, which are the counts of beautiful pairs.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
