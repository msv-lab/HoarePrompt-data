Output State: **`num` is the next element from the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is increased by the size of the set `freq` that contains the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`), `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- The value of `beautiful_count` is increased by the size of the set `freq` that contains the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`).
- The value of `mod_x` remains `num % x`.
- The value of `mod_y` remains `num % y`.
- The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `required_mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
