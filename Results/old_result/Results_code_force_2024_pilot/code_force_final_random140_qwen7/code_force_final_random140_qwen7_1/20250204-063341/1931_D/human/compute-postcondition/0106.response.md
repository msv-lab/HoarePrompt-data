Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain a list of integers where each integer represents the value of `beautiful_count` computed for each `case` in `test_cases`. The length of `results` will be equal to the number of cases in `test_cases`. For each case, `beautiful_count` is calculated based on the given logic involving modulus operations and frequency counting of specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs within the array `a`.**

- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- Each `case` in `test_cases` has its parameters `n`, `x`, and `y` unchanged.
- The array `a` remains unchanged across all iterations.
- The `freq` dictionary accumulates counts of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs across all cases.
- `beautiful_count` is updated for each case and appended to `results`.
- Variables like `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are specific to the last number processed in the last case's array `a`.
- `results` will contain the final count of "beautiful" numbers for each case, as defined by the given logic.
