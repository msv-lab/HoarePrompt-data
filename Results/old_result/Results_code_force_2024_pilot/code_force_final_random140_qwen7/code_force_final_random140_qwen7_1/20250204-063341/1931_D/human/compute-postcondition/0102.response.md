Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `beautiful_count` will be the sum of all increments it received during each iteration. `results` will contain the value of `beautiful_count` after each iteration, starting from the initial state where `beautiful_count` is 0. The length of `results` will be equal to the number of elements in `a`. `n` will still be `case['params'][0]`, `x` will still be `case['params'][1]`, `y` will still be `case['params'][2]`, and `a` will be the list that was initially provided. `freq` will be a defaultdict with default factory `int`, and it will contain counts of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs encountered throughout the iterations. `mod_x` and `mod_y` will be the last computed values of `num % x` and `num % y` respectively, and `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` will be the final values calculated based on the last `num` processed in `a`.

In summary, `beautiful_count` will reflect the total count of numbers in `a` that meet the specified conditions across all iterations, and `results` will log this count after each iteration.
