### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `a`.
   - These values are stored in a list of dictionaries called `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case:
     - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
     - It iterates through each element `num` in the array `a` and calculates its modulus with respect to `x` and `y`.
     - It then calculates the required modulus values (`required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`) that would make the pair beautiful.
     - If the required modulus pair exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
     - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the results list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initialization:**
  - The program correctly initializes `t` and reads the test cases into `test_cases`.
  - The function `func_1` is called with `t` and `test_cases` as arguments.

- **Frequency Dictionary:**
  - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to count the occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
  - This helps in efficiently checking if a required pair exists in the array.

- **Modulus Calculations:**
  - The program correctly calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element in the array.
  - It then calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` based on the given conditions.
  - The logic for calculating `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is correct:
    - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`
    - `required_mod_y = mod_y`

- **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
  - The program correctly increments `beautiful_count` when a required pair is found in the frequency dictionary.
  - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair after processing each element.

- **Final Results:**
  - The program appends the `beautiful_count` to the results list for each test case.
  - It prints the results for each test case, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and the annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
