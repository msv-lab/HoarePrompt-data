Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `beautiful_count` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `beautiful_count` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all the variables from the initial state and adds the new variable `beautiful_count` initialized to 0.
