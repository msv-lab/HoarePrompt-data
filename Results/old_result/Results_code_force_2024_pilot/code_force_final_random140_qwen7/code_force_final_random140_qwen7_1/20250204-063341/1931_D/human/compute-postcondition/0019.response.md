Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is num % y, `mod_x` is num % x, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `a` must contain at least one element**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_y` to be `num % y`. The other variables (`freq[mod_x, mod_y]`, `mod_x`, `beautiful_count`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
