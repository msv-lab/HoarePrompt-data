Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, the function calculates the value of 'beautiful_count' based on specific logic involving modulus operations and frequency counting of specific (mod_x, mod_y) pairs within the array 'a'. The function returns a list of integers named 'results', where each integer corresponds to the 'beautiful_count' for each test case in 'test_cases'.**
