The code appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the list `results`. This means that `beautiful_count` is stored in `results`, and its value is updated to the latest count before moving to the next iteration or operation. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`results` now contains the current value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged, and `beautiful_count` is updated to the latest count.**
