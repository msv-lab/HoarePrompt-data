Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of "beautiful" elements in the array based on specific modulus conditions and stores these counts in a list. Finally, it returns this list of counts.**
