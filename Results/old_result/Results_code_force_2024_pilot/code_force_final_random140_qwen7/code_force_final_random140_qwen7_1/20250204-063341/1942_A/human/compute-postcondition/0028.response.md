Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more test cases indicated by `int(input())` being greater than 0. After all iterations, `n` and `k` will retain their values from each individual test case that was processed. There will be no final aggregated value for `n` and `k`; instead, they will reflect the last set of `n` and `k` values from the last test case executed.

In other words, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be determined by the values of `n` and `k` from the last test case that was processed, with the condition that there must be at least one test case.
