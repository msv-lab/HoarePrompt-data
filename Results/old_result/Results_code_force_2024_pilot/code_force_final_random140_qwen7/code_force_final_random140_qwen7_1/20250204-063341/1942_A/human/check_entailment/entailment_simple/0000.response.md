Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and constraints as specified in the problem statement.
2. It checks for the base cases where `n == k` and `k == 1`, which are valid scenarios according to the problem description.
3. For the case where `n == k`, it prints an array where every element is 1, ensuring that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. For the case where `k == 1`, it prints an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`, ensuring only the original array is sorted.
5. In all other cases, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid array exists for those values of `n` and `k`.

Given these points, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
