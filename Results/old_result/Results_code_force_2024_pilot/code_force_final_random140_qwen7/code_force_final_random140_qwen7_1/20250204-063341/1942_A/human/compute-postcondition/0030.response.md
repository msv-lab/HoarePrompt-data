Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints either a sequence of numbers or -1 based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, if \( n \) equals \( k \), it prints a sequence of \( n \) ones. If \( k \) equals 1, it prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \). Otherwise, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the result of the last test case, with no further aggregation of results.**
