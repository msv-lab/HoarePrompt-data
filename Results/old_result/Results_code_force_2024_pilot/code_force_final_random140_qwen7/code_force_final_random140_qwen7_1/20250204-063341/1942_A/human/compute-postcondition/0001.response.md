Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes user input, splits it into two parts based on space, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the actual input values are not provided, the output state only indicates that `n` and `k` are integers resulting from the input.
