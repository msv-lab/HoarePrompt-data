Given the initial state where `n` is an input integer and `k` is an input integer with the specific condition that `k` is 1, we need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:

```python
print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Range Function**: The `range(n)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `n-1`. For example, if `n` is 5, then `range(5)` will generate the sequence `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

2. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]` will convert each number in the sequence generated by `range(n)` to a string after adding 1 to it. So, if `n` is 5, this list comprehension will produce the list `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.

3. **Joining Strings**: The `' '.join()` method joins all the strings in the list with a space character as the separator. Therefore, if the list is `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`, the result will be the string `'1 2 3 4 5'`.

4. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement will output the resulting string.

Since `k` is explicitly stated to be 1 and does not affect the output of the given code snippet, we only need to focus on the value of `n`.

Output: **'1 2 3 ... n' (where the numbers are separated by spaces and represent the sequence from 1 to n)**
