You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more test cases indicated by `int(input())` being greater than 0. After all iterations, `n` and `k` will retain their values from each individual test case that was processed. There will be no final aggregated value for `n` and `k`; instead, they will reflect the last set of `n` and `k` values from the last test case executed.
    #
    #In other words, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be determined by the values of `n` and `k` from the last test case that was processed, with the condition that there must be at least one test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints either a sequence of numbers or -1 based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, if \( n \) equals \( k \), it prints a sequence of \( n \) ones. If \( k \) equals 1, it prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \). Otherwise, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the result of the last test case, with no further aggregation of results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of the \(n\) cyclic shifts of \(a\) are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) from the input.
   - It checks three specific conditions:
     - If \(n = k\), it prints an array where every element is `1`. This ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
     - If \(k = 1\), it prints an array where elements are increasing (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, ...]`). Only one cyclic shift will be sorted.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid array can be generated.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Case \(n = k\):**
     - If \(n = k\), the solution correctly prints an array of all `1`s, ensuring all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - **Case \(k = 1\):**
     - If \(k = 1\), the solution correctly prints an array with increasing values, ensuring only one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - **Other Cases:**
     - For other cases, the solution correctly prints `-1` because no valid array can be generated to meet the requirement of having exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(n \neq k\) and \(k \neq 1\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases like \(n = k\) and \(k = 1\) appropriately.
   - The solution also correctly handles the case where no valid array can be generated.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
