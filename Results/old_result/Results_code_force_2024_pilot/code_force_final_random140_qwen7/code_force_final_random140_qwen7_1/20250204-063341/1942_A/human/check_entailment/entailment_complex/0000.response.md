Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the first condition where \( n = k \). It prints a sequence of \( n \) ones, which ensures that every cyclic shift of the array is sorted.
2. The function correctly handles the second condition where \( k = 1 \). It prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \), ensuring only the original array is sorted and all other cyclic shifts are not.
3. For all other cases, the function correctly prints -1, indicating that no valid array exists that meets the criteria.
4. The function processes each test case independently and outputs the result for each test case as required.
5. The function does not aggregate results across test cases, which is appropriate since the problem specifies separate outputs for each test case.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
