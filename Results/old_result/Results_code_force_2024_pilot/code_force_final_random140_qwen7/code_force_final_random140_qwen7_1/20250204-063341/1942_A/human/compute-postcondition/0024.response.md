Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer at least 2 and equals the first integer input.
- `k` is an integer at least 2 and equals the second integer input.
- The loop can execute again if `int(input())` is at least 1.

The `print(-1)` statement is executed outside any conditional or looping structure provided in the initial state. This means it will print `-1` regardless of the inputs or conditions mentioned.

Output: **-1**
