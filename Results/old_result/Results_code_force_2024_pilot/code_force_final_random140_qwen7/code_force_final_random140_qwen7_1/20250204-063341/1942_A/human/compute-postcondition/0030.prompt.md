You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more test cases indicated by `int(input())` being greater than 0. After all iterations, `n` and `k` will retain their values from each individual test case that was processed. There will be no final aggregated value for `n` and `k`; instead, they will reflect the last set of `n` and `k` values from the last test case executed.
    #
    #In other words, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be determined by the values of `n` and `k` from the last test case that was processed, with the condition that there must be at least one test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, t is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, and n and k are integers between 1 and 10^3 inclusive with the condition that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function returns a result based on the values of n and k for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
