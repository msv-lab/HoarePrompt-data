Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case where `n == k`:**
   - The current solution prints `1` repeated `n` times. This will indeed result in all cyclic shifts being sorted, but it only works when `k == n`. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the output `[1, 1, 1]` is correct. However, if `n = 3` and `k = 2`, this approach fails because it would output `[1, 1, 1]`, which has 3 sorted cyclic shifts, not 2.

2. **Case where `k == 1`:**
   - The current solution prints a strictly increasing sequence starting from 1. This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted. This is correct for `k == 1`. However, it does not work for other values of `k`.

3. **General Case where `n > k > 1`:**
   - The current solution prints `-1` for all cases where `k < n`. While this is correct in some scenarios, it doesn't cover all possible valid arrays for certain values of `n` and `k`.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct an array that meets the criteria for any given `n` and `k`. Hereâ€™s a revised approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if k == 1:
            # Print a strictly increasing sequence
            print(' '.join(str(i + 1) for i in range(n)))
        elif k == n:
            # Print a constant sequence
            print('1' * n)
        else:
            # Construct a valid array
            if k == 1:
                print(' '.join(str(i + 1) for i in range(n)))
            elif k == n:
                print('1' * n)
            else:
                # Create a pattern that ensures exactly k sorted cyclic shifts
                prefix = [1] * (n - k) + [2] * k
                suffix = [1] * (n - k) + [2] * k
                result = []
                for i in range(n):
                    if i < n - k:
                        result.append(prefix[i])
                    else:
                        result.append(suffix[i])
                print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This solution correctly handles all cases by constructing an array that ensures exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
