Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, t is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, and n and k are integers between 1 and 10^3 inclusive with the condition that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function returns a result based on the values of n and k for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the given constraints and requirements.
