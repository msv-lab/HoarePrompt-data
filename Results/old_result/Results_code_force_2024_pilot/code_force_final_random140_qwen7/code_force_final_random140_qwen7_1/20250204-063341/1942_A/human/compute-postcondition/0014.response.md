Given the initial state where `n` is an integer input split from the input string and `k` is another integer input split from the input string with both values being at least 2:

The code snippet is:
```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. `('1 ' * n)` generates a string consisting of `n` repetitions of the substring `'1 '` (a space after each '1').
2. `[:-1]` slices the generated string to remove the last character (which is a space).

Since `n` is at least 2, the string generated will look like `'1 1'` for `n = 2`, `'1 1 1'` for `n = 3`, and so on, with a space between each '1'.

Therefore, the output will be a string of `n` ones separated by spaces, ending without a trailing space.

Output: **'1 1' (if n = 2), '1 1 1' (if n = 3), and so on, with n ones separated by spaces)**
