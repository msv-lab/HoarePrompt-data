Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for` loop statement `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are the loop counter (which is represented by `_`), and the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will run for a number of times determined by the integer input provided by the user. Each iteration of the loop does not change the values of `n` and `k` according to the given postcondition.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: Since the loop does not modify `n` and `k`, and the only variable that changes is the loop counter `_`, we need to focus on the loop counter and the input value.

Given that the loop counter `_` is incremented with each iteration and the input value determines the total number of iterations, we need to ensure that the loop can continue for one more iteration. This means the input value should be greater than the current number of iterations.

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly shown in the state, we infer that at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has run once, meaning the input value has decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be at least 2.

State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, the input value must be at least 2**
