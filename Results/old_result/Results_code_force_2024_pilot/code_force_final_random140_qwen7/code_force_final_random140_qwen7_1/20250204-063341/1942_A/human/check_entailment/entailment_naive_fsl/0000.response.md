Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only handles two special cases: when `n == k` and when `k == 1`. However, it fails to generate a valid array for other values of `n` and `k`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 2`. According to the problem statement, we need to find an array where exactly two out of the three cyclic shifts are sorted. The program will output `-1` for this case, which is incorrect because a valid array exists. For instance, the array `[1, 2, 3]` has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3, 1]`.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
