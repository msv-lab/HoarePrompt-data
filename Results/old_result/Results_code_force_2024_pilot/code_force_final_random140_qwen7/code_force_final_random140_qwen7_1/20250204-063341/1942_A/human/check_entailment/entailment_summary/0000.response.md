Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case where \( n = k \). In this scenario, it prints a sequence of \( n \) ones, which ensures that every cyclic shift is sorted.
2. The program also correctly handles the case where \( k = 1 \). Here, it prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \), ensuring only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
3. For other cases, the program prints -1, indicating no valid array exists that meets the criteria.
4. The program processes each test case independently and outputs the result for each test case without aggregating results, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given these observations, the program appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
