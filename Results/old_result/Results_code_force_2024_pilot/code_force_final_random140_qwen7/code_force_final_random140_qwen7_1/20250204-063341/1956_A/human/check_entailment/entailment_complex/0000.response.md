Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the number of winners in a game based on a sequence of player positions to be removed and the initial number of players.
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` calculates the number of players remaining after removing players according to the sequence `p` for each initial number of players from 1 to 100. This is done using a list `remaining_players` where each index represents the initial number of players and the value at each index represents the number of players remaining.
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the necessary parameters, calls `func_1` to get the remaining players for each initial number of players, and then uses these results to determine the number of winners for each specified initial number of players (`qs`).

Let's verify the correctness of the program based on the provided example and the general logic:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `k = 2`, `q = 1`, `p = [3, 5]`, `n = 5`
   - Expected Output: `2` (Players A and B remain as winners)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `k = 2`, `q = 5`, `p = [3, 5]`, `n = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9]`
   - Expected Output: `2 1 1 1 1` (Players A and B remain as winners for n = 5, Player A remains as winner for n = 3, Players A and B remain as winners for n = 6, Player D remains as winner for n = 7, and Players A and B remain as winners for n = 9)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `k = 2`, `q = 4`, `p = [3, 4]`, `n = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Expected Output: `1 1 1 1` (Player A remains as winner for n = 1, Player A remains as winner for n = 2, Player A remains as winner for n = 3, and Player A remains as winner for n = 4)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `k = 2`, `q = 1`, `p = [3, 4]`, `n = 10`
   - Expected Output: `1` (Player A remains as winner for n = 10)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `k = 2`, `q = 1`, `p = [3, 4]`, `n = 50`
   - Expected Output: `50` (Player A remains as winner for n = 50)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `k = 3`, `q = 3`, `p = [10, 20, 30]`, `n = [1, 10, 100]`
   - Expected Output: `1 10 68` (Player A remains as winner for n = 1, Players A to J remain as winners for n = 10, and Players A to Y remain as winners for n = 100)

Based on the logic and the expected outputs, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
