The function accepts a sorted list of positive integers `p` where each element is between 1 and 100, inclusive. It initializes a list `remaining_players` of length 101 with all elements set to 0. For each integer `n` from 1 to 101, it updates `cur_n` to `n` and repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` becomes 0. Finally, it stores the result in `remaining_players[n]`. After completing these operations for all `n`, the function returns `remaining_players`, which is a list of length 101 where all elements are 0.
