Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` is the first integer input split, `q` is the second integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` (elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`), `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`**.

The code `k, q = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `k` and `q` respectively. The values of `t`, `p`, `qs`, `results`, and `remaining_players` remain unchanged from their initial state.
