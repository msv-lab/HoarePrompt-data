Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem description and the expected behavior as summarized.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of players remaining after each round for all possible initial player counts from 1 to 100.
   - The logic iterates through each player count `n` and removes players at positions specified by the list `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The `remaining_players` list is correctly initialized and updated for each `n`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to get the remaining players for all possible initial player counts.
   - Using the results from `func_1`, it extracts the relevant information for each `n` in `qs` and formats the output.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries:
- The `func_1` function correctly simulates the process of removing players based on the sequence `p` for all possible initial player counts.
- The `func_2` function correctly processes the test cases, using the results from `func_1` to determine the number of winners for each initial player count `n`.

Since both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
