Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and assigns the resulting list to `qs`. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `results` remain unchanged.
