### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where players are removed based on positions defined by a sequence `p`. For each initial number of players `n`, we need to determine how many players remain until no more players can be removed.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` is flawed. The loop iterates over each possible initial number of players `n` and attempts to remove players according to the sequence `p`. But the logic inside the loop is incorrect. Specifically, the `bisect.bisect_right` function is used incorrectly, and the `cur_n` variable is not properly updated to reflect the actual number of players remaining.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input, processes it using `func_1`, and outputs the results.
   - While the overall structure of `func_2` is correct, it relies on the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.

4. **Checking Correctness:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the removal process for each initial number of players. The use of `bisect.bisect_right` and the subsequent subtraction of `count` from `cur_n` is flawed because it does not accurately reflect the number of players remaining.
   - The `remaining_players` list is initialized to all zeros, and the loop logic does not update the list correctly. As a result, the final `remaining_players` list will not contain the correct number of remaining players for any initial number of players.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the sequence `p` includes a position that exceeds the current number of players, the code will incorrectly skip those positions without updating the `remaining_players` list.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The `func_1` function is flawed, leading to incorrect results for the number of remaining players.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
