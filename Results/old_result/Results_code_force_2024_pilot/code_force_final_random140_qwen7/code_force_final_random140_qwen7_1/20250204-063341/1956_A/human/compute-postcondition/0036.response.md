Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than 0, and the operation `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` has been performed.**

Explanation: The code `count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` updates the variable `count` to be the index of the first element in the list `p` that is greater than `cur_n`. Given that `cur_n` is 0 and all elements starting from index 1 in `remaining_players` are 0, the operation `bisect.bisect_right(p, 0)` will find the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 0. Since no such element exists (all elements starting from index 1 are 0), `count` will be set to the length of `p`, which is 101. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `p`, we can only say that `count` is updated to the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 0, which is 101 in this case.
