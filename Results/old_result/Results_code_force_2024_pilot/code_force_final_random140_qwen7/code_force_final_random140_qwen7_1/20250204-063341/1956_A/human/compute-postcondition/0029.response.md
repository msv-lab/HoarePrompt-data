Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `remaining_players[n] = cur_n` updates the `remaining_players` list at index `n` with the value of `cur_n`. Given the initial state, `n` is 2, and `cur_n` is 0. Therefore, `remaining_players[2]` is set to 0. All other elements in the list remain unchanged, as they were already 0. The variables `n`, `cur_n`, and `count` also remain unchanged as no further operations are performed on them. Thus, the output state reflects these unchanged values and the updated element in the list.
