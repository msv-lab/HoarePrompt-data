Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 3, `count` is 0**.

Explanation: The code sets `cur_n` to the value of `n`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `remaining_players` is still a list of length 101 with all elements starting from index 1 being 0, `n` is still 3, `cur_n` is now 3, and `count` is still 0.
