Output State: **`k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k`, `q` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the sequence `a` where 1 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_k` ≤ 100; `qs` is a list of `q` integers representing `n_i` where 1 ≤ `n_i` ≤ 100; `t` is an input integer; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
