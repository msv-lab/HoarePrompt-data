### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the game where players are removed based on positions defined by the sequence `p`.
   - For each initial number of players `n`, we need to determine how many players remain until no more players can be removed.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100.
   - It uses a list `remaining_players` to store the number of remaining players for each initial number of players.
   - The loop iterates over each possible initial number of players `n` and removes players according to the sequence `p`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input, processes it using `func_1`, and outputs the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the precomputed remaining players and then uses these to determine the final number of remaining players for each initial player count `n`.

4. **Checking Correctness:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process for each initial number of players.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the maximum possible number of players (100) and the minimum (1).
   - It correctly skips players that do not exist in the current lineup.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a potential issue with the logic in `func_1` that could lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the way the function handles the removal of players might not always produce the correct sequence of remaining players.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function iterates over each possible initial number of players `n` from 1 to 100.
  - For each `n`, it removes players according to the sequence `p` and updates the `remaining_players` list.
  - The key issue is in the loop where it removes players:
    ```python
    while cur_n >= min(p):
        count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
        cur_n -= count
    ```
    - This loop will remove players in a greedy manner, but it does not guarantee that the sequence of removals is consistent with the game rules. For example, if `p` is `[3, 5]` and `n` is 5, the function will first remove the 3rd player (C), then the 5th player (E), but it does not ensure that the sequence of removals is correct for all cases.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - This function correctly processes the input and outputs the results based on the precomputed `remaining_players` list from `func_1`.
  - However, since `func_1` might produce incorrect results due to the greedy removal approach, the final output could be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Given the potential issues with the greedy removal approach in `func_1`, the provided code may not always produce the correct results. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
