Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k`, `q` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the sequence `a` where 1 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_k` ≤ 100; `qs` is a list of `q` integers representing `n_i` where 1 ≤ `n_i` ≤ 100; `t` is an input integer; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    remaining_players = func_1(p)
    res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` (elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`), `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer, `k` is the first integer input split, `q` is the second integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `t` is `t-1`, `k` is an integer input split, `q` is an integer input split, `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the input split, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
