Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `results` is an empty list, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`**.

Explanation: The code `remaining_players = func_1(p)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(p)` to the variable `remaining_players`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `remaining_players`. However, we know that `remaining_players` now holds the return value of `func_1(p)`, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
