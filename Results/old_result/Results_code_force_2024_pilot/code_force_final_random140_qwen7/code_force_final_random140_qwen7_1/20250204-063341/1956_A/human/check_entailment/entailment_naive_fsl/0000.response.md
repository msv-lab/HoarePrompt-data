Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Player Removal**: The function `func_1` initializes an array `remaining_players` to keep track of the number of players remaining for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100. However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly simulate the removal of players based on the sequence `p`. It subtracts the count of players that should be removed but does not properly handle the skipping of players when their positions exceed the current number of players.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the sequence `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5` (as in the example provided in the problem statement). The expected output should be `2` because players 3 and 5 are removed in the first round, leaving players 1, 2, and 4. In the second round, player 4 is removed, leaving players 1 and 2 as winners.
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates the remaining players. For `n = 5`, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect.

3. **Detailed Debugging**:
   - When `n = 5` and `p = [3, 5]`, the program should simulate the removal of players 3 and 5 in the first round, leaving players 1, 2, and 4. In the second round, player 4 is removed, leaving players 1 and 2 as winners.
   - The program fails to correctly simulate this process, leading to an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
