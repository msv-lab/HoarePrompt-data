Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is -0 (or simply 0), and `count` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `cur_n -= count` subtracts the value of `count` from `cur_n`. Since `count` is 0, `cur_n` remains unchanged and is still 0. All other variables and their states remain the same as the initial state.
