Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `t` is `t-1`, `k` is an integer input split, `q` is an integer input split, `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the input split, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code appends a string representation of the list `res` joined with spaces to the list `results`. However, since `results` was already a list containing one string, appending another string to it does not change its structure. The values of `qs`, `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `remaining_players`, and `res` remain unchanged. The only change is that `results` now contains two strings: the original string and the new string formed by joining the elements of `res` with spaces.
