Output State: `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements are 0, `n` is 101, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `n = 1` to `n = max_n`, which in this case is 101. After each iteration, `cur_n` is set to `n` and then reduced by the value of `count`, which is determined by the `bisect.bisect_right` function. However, since `p` is not defined in the provided information and the initial conditions suggest that `p` is a list of minimum player counts, and given that `cur_n` is always reduced until it becomes 0, the final state of `remaining_players` will have all elements as 0 by the end of the loop. The variable `n` will reach 101 after the last iteration, and `cur_n` and `count` will both be 0 at that point.
