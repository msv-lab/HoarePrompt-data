Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `qs` is a list of `q` integers representing `n_i` where 1 â‰¤ `n_i` â‰¤ 100, `results` is an empty list**

The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `p`. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, and `results` remain unchanged except that `p` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.
