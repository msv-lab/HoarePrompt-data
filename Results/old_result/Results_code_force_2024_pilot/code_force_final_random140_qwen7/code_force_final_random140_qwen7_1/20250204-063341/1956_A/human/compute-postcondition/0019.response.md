Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `t` is `t-1`, `k` is an integer input split, `q` is an integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `qs`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
