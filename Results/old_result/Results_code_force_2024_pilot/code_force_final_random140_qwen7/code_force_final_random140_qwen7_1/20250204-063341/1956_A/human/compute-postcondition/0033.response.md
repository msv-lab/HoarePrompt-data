Output State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 3, `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than `cur_n`.**

Explanation: The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index of the first element in the list `remaining_players` that is strictly greater than `cur_n`. Since `cur_n` is 3 and all elements starting from index 1 are 0, the `count` variable will be set to the index of the first element that is greater than 3, which does not exist in the given list. Therefore, `count` will be 101 (the length of the list). However, since the list only contains zeros and no elements are greater than 3, the `count` will remain undefined in practical terms, but for the sake of the format, it is described as the index of the first element greater than `cur_n`.
