Output State: `t` is an input integer indicating the total number of iterations the loop will execute. After all iterations, `k` and `q` will be the last integers input split for each iteration, `p` will be the last list of integers obtained from the input split for `p`, `qs` will be the last list of integers obtained from the input split for `qs`, `remaining_players` will be the return value of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` will be a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs` for the last iteration, and `results` will be a list containing strings which are the results of joining the elements of `res` with spaces for each iteration, forming a list of length `t`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the final input integer provided, `k` and `q` will be the last two integers input split, `p` will be the last list of integers input for `p`, `qs` will be the last list of integers input for `qs`, `remaining_players` will be the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` will contain the indexed elements from `remaining_players` based on `qs` for the last iteration, and `results` will be a list of space-separated strings, each corresponding to the results of `res` for each iteration.
