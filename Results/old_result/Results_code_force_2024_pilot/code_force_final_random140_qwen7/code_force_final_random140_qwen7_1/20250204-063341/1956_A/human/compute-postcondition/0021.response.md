Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `t` is `t-1`, `k` is an integer input split, `q` is an integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the input split, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `res` by indexing into `remaining_players` using the elements in `qs`. The values of `qs`, `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `remaining_players`, `results`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged except for the creation of the `res` list. The `res` list contains elements from `remaining_players` at the positions specified by the elements in `qs`.
