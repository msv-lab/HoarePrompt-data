Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head condition is `cur_n >= min(p)`. The variables involved in this condition are `cur_n` and `min(p)`.

2. **Understand Loop Condition**: 
   - `cur_n` is defined as `-count`.
   - `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than 0.
   - `min(p)` is a function that returns the minimum value from some set `p`.

3. **Current State**:
   - `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0.
   - `n` is 3.
   - `cur_n` is -count.
   - `count` is the index of the first element in `remaining_players` that is greater than 0.

4. **Determine `count`**:
   - Since all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `count` would be 0 (as there are no elements greater than 0 in the list).

5. **Calculate `cur_n`**:
   - Given `count = 0`, `cur_n = -count = 0`.

6. **Evaluate Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `cur_n >= min(p)`.
   - For the loop to continue, `0 >= min(p)` must be true.
   - This means `min(p)` must be less than or equal to 0.

7. **Adjusting States**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `min(p)` must be less than or equal to 0.
   - `cur_n` is already 0, so no adjustment is needed for `cur_n`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `min(p)` to ensure the loop condition `cur_n >= min(p)` is satisfied.

### Final Answer:
State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, and `min(p)` must be less than or equal to 0**.
