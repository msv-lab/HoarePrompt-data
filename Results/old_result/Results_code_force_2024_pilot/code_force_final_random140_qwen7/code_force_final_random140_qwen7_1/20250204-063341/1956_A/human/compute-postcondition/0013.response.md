Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` is the first integer input split, `q` is the second integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` (elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`), `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code `remaining_players = func_1(p)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1` called with the argument `p` to the variable `remaining_players`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `remaining_players` now holds the return value of `func_1(p)`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
