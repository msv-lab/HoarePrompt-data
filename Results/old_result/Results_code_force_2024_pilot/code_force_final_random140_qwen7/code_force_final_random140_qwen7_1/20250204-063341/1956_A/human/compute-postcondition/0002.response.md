State: **`t` must be at least 1, `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k`, `q` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the sequence `a` where 1 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_k` ≤ 100, `qs` is a list of `q` integers representing `n_i` where 1 ≤ `n_i` ≤ 100, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require adjustment.
- The loop condition `range(t)` means the loop will execute `t` times.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.
- The other variables (`k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `results`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.
