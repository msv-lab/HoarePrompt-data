Output State: `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 101, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0, and `remaining_players[101]` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from `n = 1` to `n = max_n`, which in this case would be 101 (since the list `remaining_players` has a length of 101). For each value of `n`, the inner while loop sets `cur_n` to 0 and updates `remaining_players[n]` to `cur_n`. Since `cur_n` is set to 0 in every iteration, `remaining_players[n]` will also be 0 for all `n` from 1 to 101. After the loop completes, `n` will be 101, `cur_n` will be 0, `count` will be 0, and `remaining_players[101]` will be 0.
