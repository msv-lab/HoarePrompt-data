Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from input split, `p` is an empty list, `qs` is a list of `q` integers representing `n_i` where 1 ≤ `n_i` ≤ 100, `results` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code `k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `k` and `q`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is only mentioned to be an input integer. The list `p` is explicitly stated to remain an empty list. The list `qs` is not modified by this code, and `results` remains an empty list. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
