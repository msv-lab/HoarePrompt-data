Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` is the first integer input split, `q` is the second integer input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split, `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` with spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends a string to the `results` list. This string is created by joining the elements of the `res` list, which contains elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`. Since `results` was not previously defined, it is initialized as a list containing this newly created string. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
