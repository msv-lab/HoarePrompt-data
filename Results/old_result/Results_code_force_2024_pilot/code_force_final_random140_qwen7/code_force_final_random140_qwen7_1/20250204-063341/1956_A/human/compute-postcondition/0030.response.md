Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `max_n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0.
   - `n` is 2.
   - `cur_n` is 0.
   - `count` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `n` in the range from 1 to `max_n + 1`.

4. **Determine the next value of `n`**: Since the loop starts with `n = 1` and increments by 1 each time, if `n` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `n` will be 3.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `n` must be within the range from 1 to `max_n + 1`. Given that `n` is now 3, it depends on the value of `max_n`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` will be incremented to 3.
   - `cur_n` and `count` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0**.
