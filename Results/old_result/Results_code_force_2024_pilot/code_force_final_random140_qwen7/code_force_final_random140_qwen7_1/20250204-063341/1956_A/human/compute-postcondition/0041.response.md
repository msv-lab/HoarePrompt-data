Output State: `remaining_players` is a list of length 101, where all elements starting from index 1 are 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in the `remaining_players` list. Since all elements in `remaining_players` starting from index 1 are initially set to 0, `cur_n` will always be compared against 0. As the loop progresses, `cur_n` decreases with each iteration until it reaches 0. After the third iteration, `cur_n` becomes 0 and does not meet the condition `cur_n >= min(p)` anymore, so the loop terminates. At this point, `count` remains 0 because there are no positive values in `remaining_players` to find using `bisect.bisect_right`. All other variables (`n`, `remaining_players`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
