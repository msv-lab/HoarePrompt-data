Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will include `t` being decremented to 0 after all iterations are completed, `k` and `q` being the last set of integers input split during the last iteration of the loop, `p` being the list of integers obtained from the input split during the last iteration, `qs` being the list of integers obtained from the input split during the last iteration, `remaining_players` being the return value of `func_1(p)` from the last iteration, `res` being a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`, and `results` being a list containing strings which are the results of joining the elements of `res` with spaces from each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `t` will be 0.
- `k` and `q` will be the values input during the last iteration.
- `p` will be the list of integers from the last input.
- `qs` will be the list of integers from the last input.
- `remaining_players` will be the result of `func_1(p)` from the last iteration.
- `res` will be the list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by `qs` from the last iteration.
- `results` will be a list of space-separated strings from each iteration, showing the results of `res`.
