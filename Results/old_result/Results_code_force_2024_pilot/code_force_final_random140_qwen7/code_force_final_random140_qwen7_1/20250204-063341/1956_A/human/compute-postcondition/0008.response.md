Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from input split, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `results` is a list containing one string which is the result of joining the elements of `res` (elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`), `remaining_players` is the return value of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list of elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code appends a string to the `results` list. This string is created by joining the elements of the list `res` using a space as a separator. The list `res` contains elements from `remaining_players` indexed by the elements in `qs`. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `remaining_players`, and `res` remain unchanged except that `results` now contains the newly appended string.
