Output State: **The program returns a list of strings, each string being a space-separated list of elements from the last `remaining_players` list indexed by the corresponding `qs` list for each iteration, with `t` being the final input integer provided, `k` and `q` being the last two integers input split, `p` being the last list of integers input for `p`, `qs` being the last list of integers input for `qs`, `remaining_players` being the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, and `res` containing the indexed elements from `remaining_players` based on `qs` for the last iteration.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the program constructs a list of strings. Each string in this list is formed by taking the elements from the last `remaining_players` list and indexing them according to the last `qs` list, then joining these indexed elements with spaces. The length of this list is equal to the final input integer `t`, and `k` and `q` represent the last two integers input during the iterations.
