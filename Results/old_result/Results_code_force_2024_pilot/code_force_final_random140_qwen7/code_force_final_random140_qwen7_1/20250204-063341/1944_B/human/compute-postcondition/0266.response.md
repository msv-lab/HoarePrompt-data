Output State: **`k` is an integer; `l` contains the element `b[i-1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `b[i-1]` to the list `l`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `k` is still an integer, and `l` now includes the newly appended element.
