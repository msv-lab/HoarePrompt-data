Output State: `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4, and `rdb` is an empty iterable. The loop continues to execute as long as `2 * k - sz >= 2`. After all iterations, if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is no longer met, the loop breaks, leaving `sz` at its last valid value (either 0, 2, or 4) and `rdb` as an empty iterable since all elements have been processed.
