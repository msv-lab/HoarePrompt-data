Postcondition: `k` is either -2 or 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` remains unchanged unless `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` now contains `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]`. If `b[i + 1]` equals `b[i]` and `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains `b[i + 1]`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `l` and `k`.
