Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range definition `range(1, n)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 (since the range is defined as `range(1, n)`).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Identify the variables that need adjustment**: The only variables directly involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these two variables.

5. **Initial values of `i` and `n`**: Initially, `i` is set to 1 and `n` is an input integer.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` should be set to an input integer such that the loop can execute. This means `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`).

Therefore, the state after adjustment should include these conditions.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
