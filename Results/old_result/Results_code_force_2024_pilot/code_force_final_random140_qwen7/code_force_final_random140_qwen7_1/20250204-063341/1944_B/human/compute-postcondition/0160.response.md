Output State: **`q` is `t`, `k` is -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + len(a) + 1`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended to the previous elements, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, and `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, and `ans1` is updated by appending `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `b` is initially an empty list, `b[i]` does not have a specific value yet. However, the structure of the variables remains as described in the initial state, with the addition that `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` appended to it.
