Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `ldb` is empty.
   - `sz` is increased by either 4 or 6 depending on the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `sng`. For the loop to execute, `sng` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `ldb` is not involved in the loop head, its state (being empty) does not need to be adjusted.
   - The loop will only execute if `sng` has at least one element. Therefore, `sng` must have at least one element.
   - The value of `sz` is irrelevant for the loop to execute, as long as `sng` has at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`sng` must have at least one element**.
