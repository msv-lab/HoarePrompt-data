Based on the initial state provided, we know that `ldb` contains at least one element, but we do not have any specific information about the value of `elem` or how it is derived. The `print` statement simply prints `elem` twice followed by a space, without any additional context or formatting.

Given this information, we can only say that `elem` is an element from the list `ldb`. Since we don't have more details about `elem`, we cannot specify its exact value.

Output: **elem elem**
