Output State: **`n` must be less than `len(l)`, `i` is `n`, `ans1` contains the element at index `n` of list `l`, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is `n`) of list `l` to the list `ans1`. The conditions and values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged except that `ans1` now includes the element from `l` at index `n`.
