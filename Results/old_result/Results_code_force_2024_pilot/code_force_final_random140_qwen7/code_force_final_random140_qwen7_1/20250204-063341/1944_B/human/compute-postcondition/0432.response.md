Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `sz` is either 2, 4, or 6.
   - `rdb` is an empty iterable.
   - `sng` is not empty.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `sng`. Since `sng` is not empty, the loop will execute at least once. After each iteration, `elem` will take the value of the current element being processed from `sng`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain elements. Therefore, after the first iteration, `sng` will have one fewer element than it did before the loop started.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `sz` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `sz`.
   - `rdb` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `rdb`.
   - `sng` now contains one fewer element than it did at the start of the loop. It is still not empty, but it has one fewer element.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`sz` is either 2, 4, or 6; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is not empty and has one fewer element than it did at the start of the loop.**
