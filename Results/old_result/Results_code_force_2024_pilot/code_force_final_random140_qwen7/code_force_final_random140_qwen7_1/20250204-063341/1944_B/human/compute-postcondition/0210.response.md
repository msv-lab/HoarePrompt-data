Output State: **`k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans1` is a list with the element `l[i]` appended to it; `ans2` is a list with the element `l[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `l[i]` to `ans2`. Since `ans1` was already a list with the element `l[i]` appended to it, now `ans2` also includes this element. The value of `k` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement as mentioned in the initial state.
