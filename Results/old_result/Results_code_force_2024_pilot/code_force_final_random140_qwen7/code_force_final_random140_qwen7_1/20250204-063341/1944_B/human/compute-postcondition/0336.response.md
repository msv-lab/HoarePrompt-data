Postcondition: `ans2` now contains the element `l[n+2]`, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans1` now contains the element `l[i-1]`, and `k` is 0. If `k` equals 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the value of `k`.
