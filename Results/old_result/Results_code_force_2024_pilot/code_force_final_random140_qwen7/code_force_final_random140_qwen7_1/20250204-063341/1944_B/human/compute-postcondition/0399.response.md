Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 0.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
- The value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

Given these conditions, let's break down the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement:

1. `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be an element from the iterable `rdb` because it is being printed twice.
2. Since `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, it contains at least one element. The exact value of `elem` cannot be determined without knowing the specific elements in `rdb`, but it will be one of those elements.
3. The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function means that there will be a space after the second `elem` is printed, but no newline.

Therefore, the output will consist of two identical elements from the iterable `rdb`, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is an element from the non-empty iterable `rdb`)
