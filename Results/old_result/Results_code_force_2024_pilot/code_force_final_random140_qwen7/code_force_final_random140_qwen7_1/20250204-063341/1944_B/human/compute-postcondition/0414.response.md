Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, and `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than before and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `sz` or `rdb`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial state, `sz` remains either 0 or 2, and `rdb` is described as a non-empty iterable with one less element than before, indicating it has undergone some operation that reduced its size by one. The `break` statement itself does not alter these conditions.
