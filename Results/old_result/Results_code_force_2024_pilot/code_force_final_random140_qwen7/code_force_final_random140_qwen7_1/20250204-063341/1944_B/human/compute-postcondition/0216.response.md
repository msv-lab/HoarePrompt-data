Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 2, `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1]]`, `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], l[2]]**.

Explanation: The code appends `l[i]` to `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans2` will have its third element set to `l[2]`. The other variables (`k` and `i`) remain unchanged, and `ans1` is unaffected by this operation.
