Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is an integer from the input split by space, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the sorted first `k` elements of `a`, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `k`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `b`, which is initially a sublist of `a` containing the first `k` elements. After sorting, `b` contains the first `k` elements of `a` in ascending order. The values of `a`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged.
