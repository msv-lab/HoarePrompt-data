Postcondition: `q` is `t`, `k` is 0, `i` is greater than `n + len(a)`, `ans1` is a list containing all elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates are appended twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, and `l` is a list containing all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`. The last element of `b` is not in `ans1`.
