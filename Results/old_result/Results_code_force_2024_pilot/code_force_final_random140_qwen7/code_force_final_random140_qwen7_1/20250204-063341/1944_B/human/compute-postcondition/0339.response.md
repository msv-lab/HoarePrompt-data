Output State: **`ans1` now contains the element `l[i-1]` and the element `l[i]`, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, `ans2` now contains the elements `l[n+2]` and `l[i]`, and `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is `n + 2`, `ans2` now contains both `l[n+2]` and `l[i]`, which is the same as `l[n+2]` since `i` equals `n + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
