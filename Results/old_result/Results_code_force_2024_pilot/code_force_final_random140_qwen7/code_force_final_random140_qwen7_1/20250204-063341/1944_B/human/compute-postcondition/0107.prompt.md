Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All elements in `c` have been processed, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 0 or less than 0, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `c`, and `l` remains unchanged as per the initial state or is set based on the final condition of `b[n-1]` not being in `ans1` if applicable.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be less than `len(l)`, `i` is `n`, `ans1` contains the element at index `n` of list `l`, `ans2` now contains the element at index `n` of list `l`, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be less than `len(l)`, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans1` contains two elements, the first being the element at index `n` of list `l` and the second being the element at index `i` of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index `n` of list `l` and the element at index `i` of list `l`, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be less than `len(l)`, `i` is `n + 2`, `ans1` contains the element at index `n` of list `l` appended with the element at index `i` of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index `n + 2` of list `l` appended with the element at index `i` of list `l`, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
