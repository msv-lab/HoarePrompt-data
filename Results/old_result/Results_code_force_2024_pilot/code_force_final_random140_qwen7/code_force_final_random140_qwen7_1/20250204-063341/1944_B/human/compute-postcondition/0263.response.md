Output State: **`k` is an integer; `ans1` has appended `b[i]` to its current list.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as the condition to break out of the loop or if statement is not met (since `k` is an integer and no operation changes its value). Therefore, `k` is still an integer, and `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]` in its list.
