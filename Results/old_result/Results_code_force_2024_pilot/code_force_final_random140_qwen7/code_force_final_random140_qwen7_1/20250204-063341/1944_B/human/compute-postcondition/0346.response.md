Functionality: **The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It sorts the first half of the list and the second half separately. Then, it identifies pairs of identical elements from both halves and constructs two lists, `ans1` and `ans2`, containing up to 2k such pairs. If there are fewer than 2k unique elements, it includes additional elements from the remaining list until 2k elements are included in each list. Finally, it prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2`.**
