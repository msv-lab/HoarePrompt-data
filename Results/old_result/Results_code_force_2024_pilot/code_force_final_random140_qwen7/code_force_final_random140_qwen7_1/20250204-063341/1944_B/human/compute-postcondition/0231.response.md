Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is an integer from the input split by space, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to `c`. The variables `a`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged. `c` now contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end of the list.
