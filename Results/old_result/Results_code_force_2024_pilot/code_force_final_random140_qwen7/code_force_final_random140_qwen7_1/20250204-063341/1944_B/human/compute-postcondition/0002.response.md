Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `t` and `q` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and `q` is still 0. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers input by the user.
