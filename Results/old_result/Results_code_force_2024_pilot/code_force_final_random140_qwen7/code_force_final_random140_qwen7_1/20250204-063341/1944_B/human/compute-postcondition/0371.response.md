Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is increased by either 2 or 4 depending on whether the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is met. If the condition is true, `sz` is increased by 4. If the condition is false, `sz` is increased by 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
