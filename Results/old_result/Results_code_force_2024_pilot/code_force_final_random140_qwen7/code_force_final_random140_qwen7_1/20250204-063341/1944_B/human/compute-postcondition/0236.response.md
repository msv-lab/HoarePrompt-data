Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is doubled, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the sorted first `k` elements of `a`, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `k`, and `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `k = 2 * k` doubles the value of `k`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` is now twice its original value, while `b` and `c` still contain their respective sublists from `a`, and `ans1` and `ans2` remain empty lists.
