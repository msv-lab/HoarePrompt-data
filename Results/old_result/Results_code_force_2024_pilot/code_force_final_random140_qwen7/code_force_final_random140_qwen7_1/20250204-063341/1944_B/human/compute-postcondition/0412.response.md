Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than before.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement requires us to determine the value of `elem`.

Given that `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than before, it implies that `rdb` has been modified or iterated over in such a way that its length has decreased by one. However, the value of `elem` itself is not directly specified in the initial state. Typically, `elem` would refer to an element from `rdb`, but since no specific element is mentioned and the context does not provide more details, we cannot determine a precise value for `elem`.

Therefore, the best we can do is to describe `elem` in a general sense, acknowledging the lack of explicit value.

Output: **elem elem**
