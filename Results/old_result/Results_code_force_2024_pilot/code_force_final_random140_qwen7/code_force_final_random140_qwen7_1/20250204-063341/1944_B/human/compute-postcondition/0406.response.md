Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `elem` from the iterable `rdb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `rdb`.

3. **Analyze the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is either 0 or 2.
   - `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
   - If `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 4, then `sz` is set to 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the elements in `rdb`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `rdb`. The variable `sz` is determined by the condition and does not change within the loop itself unless the condition is met.
   - After one iteration of the loop, `rdb` will have one less element because one element has been processed.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `sz` remains either 0 or 2 (since it doesn't change within the loop).
   - `rdb` becomes a non-empty iterable with one less element than before.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `sz` is either 0 or 2, and `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than before**.
