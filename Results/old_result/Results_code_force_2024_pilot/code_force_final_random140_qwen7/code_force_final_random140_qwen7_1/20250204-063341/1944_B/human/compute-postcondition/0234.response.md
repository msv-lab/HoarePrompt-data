Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is an integer from the input split by space, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the sorted first `k` elements of `a`, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `k`, and `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans1 = []` initializes an empty list named `ans1`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `k`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `ans1` being an empty list.
