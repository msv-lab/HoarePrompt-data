Output State: `k` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`, `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` has reached `n` and the condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied. Since `k` was set to 0 at the start and remains unchanged inside the loop, it stays 0. Both `ans1` and `ans2` have been appended with each element of `l` exactly once during the loop iterations, resulting in `ans1` and `ans2` containing all elements of `l` in the same order.
