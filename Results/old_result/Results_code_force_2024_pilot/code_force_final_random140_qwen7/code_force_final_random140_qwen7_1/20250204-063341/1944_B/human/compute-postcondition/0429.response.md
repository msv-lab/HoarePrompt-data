Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 1, 3, or 5.
- `rdb` is an empty iterable.
- `sng` is not empty.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `sng` is not empty, it implies that `elem` must be an element from `sng`.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem` because `sng` could contain any non-empty iterable, and its contents are not specified. Therefore, the best we can do is to describe `elem` as an element from the non-empty iterable `sng`.

Output: **elem (an element from the non-empty iterable sng)**
