Output State: **`i` is within the range 3 to n-1, `n` is a valid integer, `ans2` now contains the elements from `c[2]` to `c[i-1]` appended with `c[i]` if `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, and `k` is decreased by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no further operations are performed after the `break`, the values of the variables remain unchanged except that the loop or conditional block is exited. Therefore, the conditions and values of `i`, `n`, `ans2`, and `k` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
