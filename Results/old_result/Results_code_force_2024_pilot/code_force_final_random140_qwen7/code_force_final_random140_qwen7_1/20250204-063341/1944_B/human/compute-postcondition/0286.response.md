Postcondition: **All elements of `b` are processed, `ans1` contains elements from `b` based on the specified rules, `ans2` is still an empty list, `l` contains all unique elements from `b` that were not followed by the same element, and `k` is 0; if the last element of `b` (`b[n-1]`) is not in `ans1`, then `l` now includes the last element of `b`.**
