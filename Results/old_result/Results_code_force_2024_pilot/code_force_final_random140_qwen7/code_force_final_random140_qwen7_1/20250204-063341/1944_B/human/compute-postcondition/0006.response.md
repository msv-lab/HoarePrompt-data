Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in place in ascending order. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged. After sorting, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` arranged in ascending order.
