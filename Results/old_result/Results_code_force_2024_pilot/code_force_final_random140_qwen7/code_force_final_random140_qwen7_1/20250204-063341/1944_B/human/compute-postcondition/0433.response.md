Output State: **`sz` is either 2, 4, or 6; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is not empty and has one fewer element than it did at the start of the loop; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `sz`, `rdb`, or `sng`. Instead, it indicates that the program exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the states of these variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
