You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        b = a[:n]
        
        c = a[n:]
        
        b.sort()

        ans1 = []

        req = k
        
        l = []
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
                ans1.append(b[i])
                ans1.append(b[i])
                k -= 2
            elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
                l.append(b[i - 1])
        
        if b[n - 1] not in ans1:
            l.append(b[n - 1])
        
        k = req
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
                ans2.append(c[i])
                ans2.append(c[i])
                k -= 2
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if k == 0:
                break
            ans1.append(l[i])
            ans2.append(l[i])
        
        print(*ans1)
        
        print(*ans2)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `ans1` and `ans2` will each contain all elements from list `l`, `i` will be equal to `len(l)`, `k` will be 0, and `l` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of 2n integers (array a) where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). It returns information based on specific conditions related to these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
