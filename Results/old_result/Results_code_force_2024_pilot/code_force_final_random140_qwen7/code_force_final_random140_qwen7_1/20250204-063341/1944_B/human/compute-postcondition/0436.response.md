Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 2, 4, or 6.
- `rdb` is an empty iterable.
- `sng` is not empty and has one fewer element than it did at the start of the loop.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Given the context, `elem` likely refers to an element from the `sng` iterable, which has been reduced by one element due to the loop.

Since `sng` is not empty but has one fewer element than it did at the start of the loop, `elem` must be the last remaining element in `sng`.

Therefore, the output will be the last element of `sng`.

Output: **last element of sng**
