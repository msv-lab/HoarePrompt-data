Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, and `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than before, and we break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is encountered, which means the loop is terminated immediately. The values of `sz` and `rdb` remain as they were at the start of the current iteration, with `sz` being either 0 or 2, and `rdb` being a non-empty iterable with one less element than before the current iteration started.
