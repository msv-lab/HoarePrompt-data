Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is doubled, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the sorted first `k` elements of `a`, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `k`, and `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The line `req = k` assigns the value of `k` to `req`. No other changes are made to the variables, so the values of `a`, `k`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
