Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `k` is either -2 or 0 depending on whether `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`
   - `ans2` is a list containing the value of `c[1]` if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, the loop can continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged (still greater than 1).
   - The values of `k` and `ans2` depend on the comparison `c[i] == c[i - 1]` at the start of the next iteration. However, since we are only asked to adjust the loop head variables, we don't need to change `k` or `ans2` explicitly here.

Given these points, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
