Output State: **`k` is 0, `l` contains `b[i - 1]`, and the current value of `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Since `k` was initially 0 and did not change, its value remains 0. The list `l` now includes `b[i - 1]`, and the condition that `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1` is still valid.
