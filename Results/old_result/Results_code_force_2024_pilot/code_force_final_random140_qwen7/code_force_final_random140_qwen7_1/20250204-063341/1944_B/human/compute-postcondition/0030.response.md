Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is encountered, the loop or conditional block is exited immediately. The values of `k`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial or last known states before the `break` statement was executed.
