Output State: **`k` is `req`, `l` remains unchanged, and if the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the last element of `b`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `k = req` simply assigns the value of `req` to the variable `k`. No changes are made to the other variables (`l` and the elements of `b`). The condition regarding `l` and the last element of `b` remains unchanged.
