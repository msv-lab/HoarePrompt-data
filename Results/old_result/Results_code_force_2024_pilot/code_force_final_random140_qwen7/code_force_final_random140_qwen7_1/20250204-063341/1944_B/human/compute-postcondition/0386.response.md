Output State: **`sng` must have at least one element, `sz` is `sz + 1`, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1. The condition regarding `sz` being greater than or equal to `2 * k` remains the same, and the requirement that `sng` must have at least one element also holds true.
