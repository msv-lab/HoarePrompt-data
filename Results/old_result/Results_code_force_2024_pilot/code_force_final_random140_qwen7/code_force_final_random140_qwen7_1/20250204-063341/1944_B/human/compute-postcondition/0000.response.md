Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a`) are not yet defined.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to hold the integer value entered by the user, ensuring it is within the specified range. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a`) remain undefined as they have not been assigned any values yet.
