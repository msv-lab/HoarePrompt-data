Output State: **`q` is `t`, `k` is 0, `i` is `n + len(a) - 1`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i]` to `ans1`. Given that `b` is an empty list, accessing `b[i]` or `b[i - 1]` would raise an IndexError if `i` were out of bounds. However, since the precondition states that `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, we assume `i` is valid. After appending `b[i]` to `ans1`, `ans1` becomes a list containing `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
