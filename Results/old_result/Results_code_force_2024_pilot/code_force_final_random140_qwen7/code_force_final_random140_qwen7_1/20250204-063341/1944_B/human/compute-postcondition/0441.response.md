Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `sz` will be equal to `2 * T`, `ldb` and `rdb` will be empty iterables, and `sng` will be an empty iterable. 

Explanation: The variable `T` represents the number of times the outer loop runs. Each iteration of the loop increments `sz` by 1 for each element processed, and since the inner loops process all elements in `lft` and `rgt` (which together form `lst`), `sz` will accumulate to `2 * T` after all iterations. Since all elements in `lft` and `rgt` are processed, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` will be empty as they do not have any remaining elements to iterate over.
