Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`**.

This means that the variable `req` has been assigned the value of `k`, which is twice the input integer `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
