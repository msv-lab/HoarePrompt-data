Postcondition: `q` is `t`, `k` is -2 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + len(a)`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, and `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, regardless of whether `b[i - 1]` is in `ans1` or not.
