Output State: **`k` is either -2 or 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` remains unchanged unless `b[i]` is not in `ans1`, in which case `l` now contains `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or conditional block it is inside. In this case, since the `break` statement is executed, the loop or conditional block is exited. The values of `k`, `i`, and `l` are updated according to their previous rules, but the `break` statement does not change these values directly. It simply means that the loop or conditional block is terminated.
