Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4.
- `rdb` is an empty iterable.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement is executed. However, there is no explicit value or definition for `elem` in the initial state. Since `elem` is not defined, it would result in a NameError if the code were to run. 

Given the context, it seems `elem` might be intended to be a variable that holds a value within the scope of the internal loop or if statement. But without further information about the value of `elem`, we cannot determine its value.

Output: **elem (where elem is undefined and would cause a NameError if executed)**
