Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lft = lst[:n]
    rgt = lst[n:]
    ldb = []
    rdb = []
    sng = []
    lft.sort()
    rgt.sort()
    if lft[0] != lft[1]:
        sng.append(lft[0])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
            ldb.append(lft[i])
        elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
            sng.append(lft[i])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
            rdb.append(rgt[i])
    sz = 0
    for elem in ldb:
        if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
        else:
            break
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= 2 * k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()
    sz = 0
    for elem in rdb:
        if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
        else:
            break
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= 2 * k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ldb` is either empty or has no more elements to iterate over, `sz` is 8, `sng` is empty or has no more elements to iterate over, `rdb` is empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: Given the loop condition `if sz >= 2 * k: break`, and knowing that `sz` starts from 4 and increases by 1 with each iteration, it will reach 8 after 4 iterations. Since `2 * k - sz` becomes `2 * k - 8`, which is no longer greater than or equal to 2 when `sz` is 8, the loop breaks. Therefore, after all iterations, `sz` will be 8, and both `sng` and `ldb` will be empty or have no more elements to iterate over, while `rdb` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: All elements in `sng` have been printed, and `sz` is equal to twice the number of elements in `sng`. The loop has stopped because the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` no longer holds, meaning `sz` has reached the maximum value it can before breaking the loop. There are no more elements left in `sng` to print, and `rdb` has been exhausted.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is either 6, 8, or 10; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
