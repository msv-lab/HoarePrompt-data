Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sng` is a list with at least one element. The variable `elem` is used within a loop or conditional statement where the loop or conditional breaks if the size of `sng` (`sz`) is greater than or equal to two times `k`.

However, since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, and no specific value for `k` or `sz` is given, we cannot determine the exact element that will be printed. We only know that `elem` is an element from the list `sng`.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of the list `sng` (since it is the only element explicitly mentioned), but without knowing the exact value, we can only describe it as such.

Output: **elem (an element from the list sng)**
