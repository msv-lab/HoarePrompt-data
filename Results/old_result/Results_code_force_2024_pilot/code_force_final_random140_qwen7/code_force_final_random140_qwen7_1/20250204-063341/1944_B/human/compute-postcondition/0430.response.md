Output State: **`sz` is either 2, 4, or 6; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is not empty; and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. Given that `sz` was initially either 1, 3, or 5, after executing `sz += 1`, `sz` can now be 2, 4, or 6. The values of `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `sz` being greater than or equal to `2 * k` still applies.
