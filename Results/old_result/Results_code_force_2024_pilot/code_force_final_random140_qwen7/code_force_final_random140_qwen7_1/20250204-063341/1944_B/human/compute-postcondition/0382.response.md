Output State: **`sng` must have at least one element, and `sz` is `sz + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sng` and `sz`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since the initial state mentions that `sng` must have at least one element and `sz` is `sz + 1`, these conditions remain unchanged, and the break statement indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block.
