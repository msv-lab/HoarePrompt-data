Output State: **All elements of `b` are processed, `ans1` contains elements from `b` based on the specified rules, `ans2` is still an empty list, `l` contains all unique elements from `b` that were not followed by the same element, and `k` is 0; `l` now includes the last element of `b` (`b[n-1]`).**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of `b` (`b[n-1]`) to the list `l`. Since `b[n-1]` was not previously in `l`, it gets added to the list. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
