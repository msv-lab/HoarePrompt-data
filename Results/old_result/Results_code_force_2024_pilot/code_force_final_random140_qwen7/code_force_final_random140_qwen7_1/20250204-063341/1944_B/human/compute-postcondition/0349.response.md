Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicates from the second element of `rgt`, and `sz` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes the variable `sz` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i` and `n` or the contents of `rdb`. The precondition states that after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` will be greater than or equal to `n-1`, and `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicates from the second element of `rgt`. Since the code only initializes `sz` to 0, the values of `i`, `n`, and `rdb` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions, and `sz` is set to 0.
