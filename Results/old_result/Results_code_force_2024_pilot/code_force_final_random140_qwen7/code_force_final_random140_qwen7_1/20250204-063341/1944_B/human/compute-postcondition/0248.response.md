Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, and `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`; `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` and is a list with one element.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, and initially `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]`, after executing the code, `ans1` will contain this value in a list format with one element. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the relationship between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
