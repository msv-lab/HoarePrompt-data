Output State: **`q` is `t`, `k` is -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + len(a) + 1`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended to the previous elements, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, `l` now contains `b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Since `b` is initially an empty list, `b[i - 1]` does not exist until it is added. After appending `b[i - 1]` to `l`, `l` now contains `b[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
