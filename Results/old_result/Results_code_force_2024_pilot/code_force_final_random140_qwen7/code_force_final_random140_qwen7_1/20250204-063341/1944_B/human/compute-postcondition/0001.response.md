State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `q` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration of the loop.
- The loop condition `q < t` must be true for the loop to continue executing.
- Since `t` is defined as an input that is a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), the loop will execute as long as `q` is less than `t`.
- Initially, `q` is set to 0, and the loop will start executing if `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the only variables in the loop head that need to be adjusted are `t` and `q`. Given that `t` is already constrained to be a positive integer between 1 and 5000, and `q` starts at 0, these are the correct states to ensure the loop can execute.
