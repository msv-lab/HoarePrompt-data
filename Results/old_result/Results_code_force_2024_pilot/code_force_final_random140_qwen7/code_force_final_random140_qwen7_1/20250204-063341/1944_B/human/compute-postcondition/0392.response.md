Output State: **`sng` must have at least one element, `sz` is `sz + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. The precondition states that `sz` is `sz + 1`, meaning `sz` was already incremented once before this line of code. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`) is not relevant to the current state update. Therefore, the only change is that `sz` is now `sz + 1`. The variable `sng` remains unchanged and must still have at least one element.
