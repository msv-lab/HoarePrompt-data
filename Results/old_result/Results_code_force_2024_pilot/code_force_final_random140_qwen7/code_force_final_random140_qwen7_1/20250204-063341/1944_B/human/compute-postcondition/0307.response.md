Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans2` is a list containing the element `c[2]` appended with `c[2]`.**

The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making `k` equal to `i - 2`, which is `0` since `i` was initially `2`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `ans2`) remain unchanged.
