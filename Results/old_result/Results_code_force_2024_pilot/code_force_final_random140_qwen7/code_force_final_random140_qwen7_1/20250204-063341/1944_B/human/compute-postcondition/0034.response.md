Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` remains unchanged, `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]` appended.**

The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is one more than its previous value. The value of `k` remains 0, `l` remains unchanged, and `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` appended to it.
