Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is 0, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, the function continues without changing the state. If `b[i - 1]` is in `ans1`, `l` contains the value of `b[i - 1]`.
