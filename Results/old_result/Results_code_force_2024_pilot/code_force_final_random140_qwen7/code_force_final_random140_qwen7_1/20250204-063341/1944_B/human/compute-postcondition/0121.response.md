Output State: **`q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `i` is `n + len(a) - 1`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of list `a`, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `c` is sorted, `req` is `k`.**

The code `req = k` simply assigns the value of `k` to `req`. Since no other operations are performed on the variables, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the only new variable introduced is `req`, which is assigned the value of `k`.
