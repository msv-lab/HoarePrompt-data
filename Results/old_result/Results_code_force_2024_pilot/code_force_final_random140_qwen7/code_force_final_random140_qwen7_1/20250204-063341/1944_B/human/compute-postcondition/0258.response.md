Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is 0. After executing the if-else block, `b[i]` is either equal to `b[i - 1]` and `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]` as a list with one element, or `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, the state remains unchanged. If `b[i - 1]` is in `ans1`, `l` contains the value of `b[i - 1]`.
