Output State: **`k` is an integer, `ans1` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i]` to `ans1`, so `ans1` now includes the element `b[i]`. The values of `k` and the condition of exiting the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged.
