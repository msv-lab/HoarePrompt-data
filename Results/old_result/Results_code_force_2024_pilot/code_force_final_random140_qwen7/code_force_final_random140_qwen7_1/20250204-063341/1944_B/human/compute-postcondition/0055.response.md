Output State: **`l` contains the last element of `b`, `k` is 0, and the last element of `b` is not in `ans1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of `b` (denoted as `b[n-1]`) to the list `l`. Since `n` refers to the index of the last element in `b`, `b[n-1]` is the last element. The values of `k` and the condition about `ans1` remain unchanged.
