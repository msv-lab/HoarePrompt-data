Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sng` is a list with at least one element, and `sz` is incremented by 1. However, the specific value of `elem` is not explicitly given, nor is there any information about how `elem` is determined or what it contains. Given this, we can only state that `elem` is an element from the list `sng`.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we cannot provide a more precise answer. Therefore, the output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the list sng)**
