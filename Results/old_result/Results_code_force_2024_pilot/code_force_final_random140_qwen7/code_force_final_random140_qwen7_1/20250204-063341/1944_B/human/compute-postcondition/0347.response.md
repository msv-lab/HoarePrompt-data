Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the postcondition will be as follows: `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than `n-1` (which is always true), and `rdb` will contain all elements from `rgt` that are consecutive duplicates. The variable `ldb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `lft`, `sng` will remain empty, and `lft` will be modified such that it no longer contains any consecutive duplicates.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `rdb` will hold a list of all consecutive duplicate elements found in `rgt`, starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element (index `n-1`). The variables `ldb`, `sng`, and the modified `lft` will retain their respective conditions as described in the initial state.
