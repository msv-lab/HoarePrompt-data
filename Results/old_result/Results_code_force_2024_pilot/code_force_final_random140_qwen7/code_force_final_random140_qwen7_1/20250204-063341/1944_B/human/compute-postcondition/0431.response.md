Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `elem` from the iterable `sng`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the iterable `sng`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is either 2, 4, or 6.
   - `rdb` is an empty iterable.
   - `sng` is not empty.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the elements in `sng`, the next element from `sng` will be processed in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `sng` will now be the remaining elements of `sng` after removing the current element.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `sz` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `rdb` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `sng` becomes the remaining elements of `sng` after processing the current element.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `sz` is either 2, 4, or 6; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is the remaining elements of the original `sng` after removing the current element.**
