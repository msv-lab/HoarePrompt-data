Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is increased by 2 if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is satisfied.

However, the values of `elem` and `k` are not explicitly provided. Since `ldb` contains at least one element, let's denote the first element of `ldb` as `elem`.

The value of `sz` depends on the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2`. Without knowing the exact value of `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `sz`. But we know that if the condition is true, `sz` will be increased by 2.

Given this information, the print statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` will print the first element of `ldb` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is the first element of `ldb`)
