Output State: **`n` must be less than `len(l)`, `i` is `n`, and the value of `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n`, `i`, or `k`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain the same as the initial state, and the break statement is noted.
