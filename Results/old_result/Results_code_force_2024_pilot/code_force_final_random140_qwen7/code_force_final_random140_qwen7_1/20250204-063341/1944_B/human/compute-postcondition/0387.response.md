Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `sng` has at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sng` must have at least one element.
   - `sz` is `sz + 1`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `sng` has at least one element, we need to ensure that `sng` still has at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `sz` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, so we need to check if `sz` is still less than `2 * k` to avoid breaking out of the loop prematurely.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `sng` must have at least one element (since the loop continues as long as `sng` has at least one element).
- `sz` is `sz + 1` (incremented by 1 from the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`sng` must have at least one element, `sz` is `sz + 1`**.
