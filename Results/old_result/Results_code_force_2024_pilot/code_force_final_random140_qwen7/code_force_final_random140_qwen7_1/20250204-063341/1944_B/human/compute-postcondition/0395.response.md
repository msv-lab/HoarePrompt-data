Based on the initial state provided:

- The list `sng` must have at least three elements.
- `sz` is incremented by 3 after the loop.
- The loop will break if `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `2 * k` during any iteration.
- If `sz` does not reach `2 * k`, the loop will process all elements in `sng`.

Given this, the print statement `print()` will simply execute without any arguments, meaning it will print an empty line.

Output: **Output a blank line**
