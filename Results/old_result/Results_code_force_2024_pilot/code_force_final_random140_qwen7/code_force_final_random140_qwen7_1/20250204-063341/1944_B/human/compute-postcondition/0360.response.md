Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in ldb`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `ldb`.
   - There are no explicit changes to `ldb` within the loop body as per the given information.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `ldb`.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ldb` contains at least one element.
   - `sz` is increased by 2 if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` was initially satisfied.
   - The loop or if statement is exited if the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` holds.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the presence of elements in `ldb`, we need to ensure that `ldb` still contains at least one element for the next iteration.
   - `sz` will be increased by 2 again if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is satisfied during the next iteration.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ldb` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `sz` will be increased by 2 again if the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is increased by 2 if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is satisfied**.
