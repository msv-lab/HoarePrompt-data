Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the input integer `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

The value of `k` is updated to be twice its original value, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
