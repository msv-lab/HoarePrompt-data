Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`.
- `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`.

The print statement `print(*ans1)` will print the elements of the list `ans1`. Since `ans1` contains all elements of the list `l` in the same order, the output will be a space-separated sequence of elements from `l`.

Output: **[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]**
