Output State: **`k` is either -2 or 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `l` remains unchanged; `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended with `b[i]`.**

This means that the list `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to its previous content. The values of `k`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
