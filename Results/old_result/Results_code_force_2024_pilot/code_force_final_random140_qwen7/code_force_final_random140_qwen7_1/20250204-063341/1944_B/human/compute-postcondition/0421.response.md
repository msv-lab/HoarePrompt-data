Output State: **`sz` is either 0, 2, or 4, `rdb` is an empty iterable, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz` or `rdb`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions and values of `sz` and `rdb` remain unchanged.
