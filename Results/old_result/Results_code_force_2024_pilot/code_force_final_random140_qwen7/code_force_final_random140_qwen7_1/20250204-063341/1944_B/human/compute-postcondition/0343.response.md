Given the initial state:
- `ans1` contains all elements from `l` except possibly the last one.
- `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements found in `l`.
- `i` is equal to `len(l)`.
- `k` is 0.
- `l` remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(*ans2)` is executed.

Let's break it down:

1. **`ans2`**: This variable contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements found in `l`. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, then `ans2` would be `[2, 2], [3, 3], [3, 3]`.

2. **`print(*ans2)`**: The `*` operator unpacks the list `ans2` so that each element of `ans2` is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

Since the exact content of `l` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of `ans2`.

Output: **[pairs of consecutive duplicate elements found in l]**
