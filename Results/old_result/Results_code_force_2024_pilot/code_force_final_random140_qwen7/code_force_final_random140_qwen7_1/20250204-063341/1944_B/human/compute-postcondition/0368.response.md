Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is increased by 4**.

Explanation: Initially, `sz` is increased by 2. The code snippet `sz += 2` further increases the value of `sz` by 2. Therefore, `sz` is increased by a total of 4. The value of `ldb` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned to contain at least one element initially.
