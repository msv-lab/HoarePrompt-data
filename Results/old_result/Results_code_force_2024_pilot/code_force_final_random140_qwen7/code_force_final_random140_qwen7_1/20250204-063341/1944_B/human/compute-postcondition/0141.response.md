Postcondition: `q` is `t`, `k` is -2 or 0, `i` is `n + len(a) - 1`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1` if the condition `b[i - 1] not in ans1` is true.
