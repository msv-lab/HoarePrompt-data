Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is 0, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`, and `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, `b[i]` is the same as `b[1]`, and since `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, which is `b[0]` (because `i - 1` is 0), `ans1` now contains the value of `b[0]`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
