Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be less than `len(l)`
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `ans1` contains two elements: the element at index `n` of list `l` and the element at index `i` of list `l`
   - `ans2` contains the element at index `n` of list `l` and the element at index `i` of list `l`
   - If `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(l)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range of `len(l)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n + 2`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ans1` and `ans2` contain elements from the list `l` based on the current value of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is changing, these lists will change accordingly.
   - `k` is not modified in the loop head, so its state remains the same.

5. **New State:**
   - `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - `ans1` and `ans2` will now contain the elements at indices `n` and `i` (which is now `n + 2`) of list `l`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be less than `len(l)`, `i` is `n + 2`, `ans1` contains the element at index `n` of list `l` and the element at index `i` (which is `n + 2`) of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index `n` of list `l` and the element at index `i` (which is `n + 2`) of list `l`, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
