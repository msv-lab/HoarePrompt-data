Output State: **`q` is `t`, `k` is -2 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + len(a)`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended to the previous elements, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is an empty list if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, or `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, and `ans1` has been updated by appending `b[i]`.**

This means that the value of `ans1` has been updated by appending `b[i]` to its existing elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
