Output State: **`ans1` now contains the element `l[i]`, `i` is `n`, `len(l)` must be greater than `n`, and `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans1`. The values of `i`, `len(l)`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `ans1` now includes the element `l[i]`, while `i` remains `n`, `len(l)` is still greater than `n`, and `k` is still 0.
