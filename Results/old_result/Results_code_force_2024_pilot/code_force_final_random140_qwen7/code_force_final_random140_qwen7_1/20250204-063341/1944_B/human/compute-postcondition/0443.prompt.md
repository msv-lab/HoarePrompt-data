You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

                print(elem, elem, end=' ')

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `sz` will be equal to `2 * T`, `ldb` and `rdb` will be empty iterables, and `sng` will be an empty iterable. 
    #
    #Explanation: The variable `T` represents the number of times the outer loop runs. Each iteration of the loop increments `sz` by 1 for each element processed, and since the inner loops process all elements in `lft` and `rgt` (which together form `lst`), `sz` will accumulate to `2 * T` after all iterations. Since all elements in `lft` and `rgt` are processed, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` will be empty as they do not have any remaining elements to iterate over.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋), and an array `a` which is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. Based on these inputs, the function determines and returns specific outputs for each test case.
