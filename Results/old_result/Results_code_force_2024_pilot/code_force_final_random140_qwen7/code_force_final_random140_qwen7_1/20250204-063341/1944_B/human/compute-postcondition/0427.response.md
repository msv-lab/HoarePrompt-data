Output State: **`sz` is either 1, 3, or 5; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is not empty; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. However, it does not change the values of the variables `sz`, `rdb`, and `sng`. Therefore, their states remain the same as the initial state.
