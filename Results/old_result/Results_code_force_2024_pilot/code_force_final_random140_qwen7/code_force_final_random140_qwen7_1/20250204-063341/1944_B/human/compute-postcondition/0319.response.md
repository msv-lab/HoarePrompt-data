Output State: **All elements in `c` have been iterated over (i.e., `i` equals `n`). `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements found in `c` throughout the entire iteration. `k` is 0 since it is decremented by 2 each time the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` is met, and it starts at 0 or -2, which means it will eventually reach 0 after a sufficient number of iterations. `l` remains unchanged as there is no operation that modifies it within the given loop.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop continues until `i` equals `n`, meaning all elements in `c` have been checked. During these iterations, if consecutive elements in `c` are duplicates, they are appended to `ans2` twice. The variable `k` is used to control the loop and is decremented each time a pair of duplicates is found, ensuring it reaches 0 and thus terminating the loop. Since `l` is not modified within the loop, it retains its initial state.
