Output State: **`sng` must have at least one element, the size of `sng` (sz) is greater than or equal to two times k, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
