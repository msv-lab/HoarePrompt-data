Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `k` is an integer from the input split by space**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer. This means `a` now holds a list of integers from the input, while `k` remains unchanged as an integer from the input split by space.
