Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a list with at least one element.
- `sz` is incremented by 1 (`sz = sz + 1`).
- There is a condition that if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

However, the specific values of `elem`, `sz`, and `k` are not provided. Since the print statement only includes `elem` followed by a space (`end=' '`), the output will depend on the value of `elem`.

Given that `sng` must have at least one element, let's assume `elem` refers to one of the elements in `sng`. Without knowing the exact value of `elem`, we can only describe it in terms of the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is one of the elements in the list sng)**
