Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is 0. The function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the value of `b[i]` as a list with one element. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `b[i - 1]` is either not in `ans1` (and the state remains unchanged) or `l` contains the value of `b[i - 1]`.
