Output State: **`q` is `t`, `k` is -2 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + len(a)`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Given the conditions in the initial state, `l` was previously either an empty list or a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`. After appending `b[i - 1]`, `l` will now contain `b[i - 1]` if it wasn't already there. All other variables remain unchanged.
