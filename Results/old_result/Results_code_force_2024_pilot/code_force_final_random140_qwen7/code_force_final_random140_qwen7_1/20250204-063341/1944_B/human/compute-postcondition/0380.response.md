Output State: **`sng` must have at least one element, sz is sz + 1, and if the size of sng (sz) is greater than or equal to two times k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code increments the size of `sng` by 1, so `sz` is now `sz + 1`. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement remains the same: if the size of `sng` (now `sz + 1`) is greater than or equal to two times `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The precondition that `sng` must have at least one element is still valid.
