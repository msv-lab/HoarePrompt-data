Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and iterates up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input split by space.
   - `k` is doubled.
   - `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the sorted first `k` elements of `a`.
   - `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `k`, and `c` is sorted.
   - `ans1` is an empty list.
   - `ans2` is an empty list.
   - `req` is equal to `k`.
   - `l` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The loop depends on `i` and `n`. Since `i` starts at 1, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
