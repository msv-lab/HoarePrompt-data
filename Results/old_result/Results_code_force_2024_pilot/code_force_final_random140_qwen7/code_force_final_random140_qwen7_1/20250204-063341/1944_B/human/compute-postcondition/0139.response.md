Postcondition: `q` is `t`, `k` is 0, `i` is `n + len(a) - 1`, `ans1` is a list that may contain `b[i - 1]` (if `b[i - 1]` was not already in `ans1`), `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` was added to `ans1`.
