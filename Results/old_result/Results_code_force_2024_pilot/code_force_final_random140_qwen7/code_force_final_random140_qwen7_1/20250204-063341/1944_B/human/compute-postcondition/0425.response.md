Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for` loop statement `for elem in sng:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is either 1, 3, or 5.
   - `rdb` is an empty iterable.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng` to iterate over. Therefore, the loop will continue if `sng` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is the variable being iterated over, it will take the next element from `sng` in the next iteration.
   - `sng` will lose its first element (the one just processed) and will become one element shorter.

5. **Consider the constraints**:
   - `sz` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.
   - `rdb` remains an empty iterable unless modified within the loop body.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are:

- `elem` will be the next element from `sng`.
- `sng` will lose its first element and thus be one element shorter.

Since no explicit changes to `sz` or `rdb` are mentioned in the problem, their states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `sz` is either 1, 3, or 5; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `elem` is the next element from `sng`; `sng` is one element shorter.**
