Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is increased by 2**.

The code `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. Since `sz` was initially increased by 2 if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` was satisfied, and now it is being incremented again by 2, the updated state is that `sz` is increased by 2. The precondition that `ldb` contains at least one element remains unchanged.
