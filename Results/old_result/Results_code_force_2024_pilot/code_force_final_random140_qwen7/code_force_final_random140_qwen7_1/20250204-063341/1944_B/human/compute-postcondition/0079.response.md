Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0, depending on whether `c[2]` equals `c[1]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[2]` equals `c[1]`, `k` is set to -2, and `ans2` now contains the element `c[2]` appended to it.
