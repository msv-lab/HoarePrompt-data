Output State: **`i` is within the range 2 to n-1, `n` is a valid integer, `ans2` now contains the element `c[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. The initial conditions for `i` being within the range 2 to n-1, `n` being a valid integer, and `ans2` containing the element `c[i]` appended to it remain unchanged. The only new information is that `c[i]` has been appended to `ans2`.
