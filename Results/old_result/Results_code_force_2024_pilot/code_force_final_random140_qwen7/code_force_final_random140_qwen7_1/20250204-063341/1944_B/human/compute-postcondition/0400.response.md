Output State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and the value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 4.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 2, making its new value 2. The value of `rdb` remains unchanged as it is a non-empty iterable. Additionally, since `2 * k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, after incrementing `sz` by 2, the condition `2 * k - sz` becomes `2 * k - 2`, which is still greater than or equal to 4 (since it was initially greater than or equal to 2 and `sz` was incremented by 2).
