Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`.
- `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]`.

The `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans2`. Since both `ans1` and `ans2` are identical and contain all elements of `l` in the same order, the output will be the same as if we were printing `ans1`.

Output: **[l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]]**
