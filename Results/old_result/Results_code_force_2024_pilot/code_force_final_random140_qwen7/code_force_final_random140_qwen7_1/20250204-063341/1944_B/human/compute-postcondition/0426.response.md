Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `sz` is either 1, 3, or 5.
   - `rdb` is an empty iterable.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `sng` with `elem` as the iterator variable.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `sng`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `sng`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `sng` itself.
   - If `sng` is not empty, the loop can execute again.

Given that `rdb` is an empty iterable and does not affect the loop condition, and considering the value of `sz` (which is either 1, 3, or 5) and the condition for breaking out of the loop (`sz >= 2 * k`), these states do not directly impact the loop's ability to continue.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `sng` to ensure it is not empty.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sz` is either 1, 3, or 5; `rdb` is an empty iterable; `sng` is not empty; and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
