Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 3, `ans1` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], l[3]]`, `ans2` is a list with elements `[l[0], l[1], l[3]]`, and we append `l[3]` to `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `l[3]` to the list `ans2`. Since `ans2` originally contains `[l[0], l[1], l[2]]`, after appending `l[3]`, `ans2` becomes `[l[0], l[1], l[2], l[3]]`. The values of `k`, `i`, and `ans1` remain unchanged.
