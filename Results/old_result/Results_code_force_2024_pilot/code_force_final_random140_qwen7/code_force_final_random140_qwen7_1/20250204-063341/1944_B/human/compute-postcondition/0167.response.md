Output State: **Postcondition: `q` is `t`, `k` is 0, `i` is greater than `n + len(a)`, `ans1` is a list containing all elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates are appended twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, and `l` is a list containing all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`.**

In this final state, the loop has executed until `k` reaches 0. Since `k` starts at 2 times the original value and decreases by 2 each time `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, it will reach 0 after `k / 2` iterations. The variable `i` will be one more than `n + len(a)` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive). `ans1` will contain all elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates are appended twice. `l` will contain all elements from `b` that are not already in `ans1`. All other variables (`q`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `l`) will remain as described in the initial and intermediate states.
