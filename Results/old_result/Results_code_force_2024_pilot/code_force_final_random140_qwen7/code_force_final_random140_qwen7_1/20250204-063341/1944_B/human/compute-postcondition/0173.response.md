Output State: **`q` is `t`, `k` is 0, `i` is greater than `n + len(a)`, `ans1` is a list containing all elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates are appended twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, and `l` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`; `k` is now equal to `req`.**

Explanation: The line `k = req` assigns the value of `req` to `k`. Since `req` is 0, `k` is also set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
