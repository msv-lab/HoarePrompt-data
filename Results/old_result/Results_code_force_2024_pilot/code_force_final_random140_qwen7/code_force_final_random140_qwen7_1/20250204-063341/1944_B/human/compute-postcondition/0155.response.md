Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` starts from 1.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**:
   - `q` is `t`.
   - `k` is -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is `n + len(a)`.
   - `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended to the previous elements.
   - `ans2` is an empty list.
   - `a` is a list of integers with length 0.
   - `b` is an empty list.
   - `c` is an empty list.
   - `req` is 0.
   - `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q` is `t`.
   - `k` is -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is `n + len(a)`.
   - `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended to the previous elements.
   - `ans2` is an empty list.
   - `a` is a list of integers with length 0.
   - `b` is an empty list.
   - `c` is an empty list.
   - `req` is 0.
   - `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n + len(a) + 1`.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `n + len(a) + 1`.
   - `k` will be -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`.
   - `ans1` will be updated based on the new value of `b[i]`.
   - `l` will be a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`q` is `t`, `k` is -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + len(a) + 1`, `ans1` is a list containing `b[i]` appended to the previous elements, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is 0, and `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.**
