Output State: **`sz` is either 1, 3, or 5; `rdb` is an empty iterable; and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. Given that `sz` could initially be 0, 2, or 4, after adding 1, `sz` can now be 1, 3, or 5. The value of `rdb` remains unchanged as it is an empty iterable. The condition related to `sz` being greater than or equal to `2 * k` and breaking out of the loop or if statement remains the same.
