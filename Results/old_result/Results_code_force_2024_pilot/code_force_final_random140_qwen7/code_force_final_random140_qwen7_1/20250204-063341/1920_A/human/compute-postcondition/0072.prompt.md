Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1, `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2, `num` will be a list containing all `v` where `t` was 3, and `t` and `v` will be the last input integers read during the loop execution; `count_num` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is 1 more than the initial value of `i`, `t` is 0, `v` is None, and `count_num` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the value of `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is `i + 1`, `t` is 0, `v` is `None`, and `count_num` remains either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether `i` is within or outside the range of `start` and `end`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is `i + 2`, `t` is 0, `v` is `None`, and `count_num` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether `i` is within or outside the range of `start` and `end`, and the initial value of `count_num`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
