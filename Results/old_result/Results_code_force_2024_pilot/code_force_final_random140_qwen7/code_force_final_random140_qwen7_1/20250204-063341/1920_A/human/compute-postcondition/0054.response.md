Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1, `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2, `num` will be a list containing all `v` where `t` was 3, and `t` and `v` will be the last input integers read during the loop execution; `count_num` is 0.**

Explanation: The given code initializes `count_num` to 0. This variable does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v`) remain as described in the initial state after the loop has executed all iterations. The value of `count_num` remains unchanged at 0.
