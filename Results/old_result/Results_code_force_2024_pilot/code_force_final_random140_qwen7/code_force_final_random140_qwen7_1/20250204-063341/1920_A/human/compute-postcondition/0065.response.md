Output State: **`count_num` is either 1 or 2 depending on the initial value, `n` is `i + 1`, `t` is 0, `v` is `None`**.

Explanation: The line `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. Since `count_num` initially is either 0 or 1 (depending on whether `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`), after incrementing, it will become either 1 or 2. The values of `n`, `t`, `v` remain unchanged.
