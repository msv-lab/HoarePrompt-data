You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, start is initially set to -1, end is initially set to 1000000000, and num is an empty list. For each constraint, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and v is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 1000000000.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1, `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2, `num` will be a list containing all `v` where `t` was 3, and `t` and `v` will be the last input integers read during the loop execution.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
    #- The variable `n` will stay within its initial range (between 2 and 100).
    #- The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating the total number of iterations executed.
    #- `start` will hold the smallest value of `v` where `t` was 1.
    #- `end` will hold the largest value of `v` where `t` was 2.
    #- `num` will contain all values of `v` where `t` was 3.
    #- The final values of `t` and `v` will be those provided as input in the last iteration of the loop.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` will be `i + (number of iterations)`, `t` will be 0, `v` will be `None`, and `count_num` will be equal to the number of iterations.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns 0 if end is less than start, otherwise it returns the difference between end and start plus one minus the count_num which is the number of iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It checks if end is less than start. If true, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between end and start plus one, minus the count_num, which is the number of iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 0 if end is less than start, otherwise it returns the difference between end and start plus one minus the count_num which is the number of iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
