Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `end` is `v`.**

The variable `end` is assigned the value of `v`, and since `t` equals 1, no changes are made to `n`, `i`, `t`, or `v`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
