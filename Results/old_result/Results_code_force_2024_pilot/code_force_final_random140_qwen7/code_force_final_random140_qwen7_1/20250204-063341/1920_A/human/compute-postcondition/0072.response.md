Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` will be `i + (number of iterations)`, `t` will be 0, `v` will be `None`, and `count_num` will be equal to the number of iterations.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be set to the initial value of `i` plus the total number of times the loop executed. The variable `t` will be reset to 0, `v` will be set to `None` since it is not used in the loop body, and `count_num` will hold the total number of iterations the loop ran through.
