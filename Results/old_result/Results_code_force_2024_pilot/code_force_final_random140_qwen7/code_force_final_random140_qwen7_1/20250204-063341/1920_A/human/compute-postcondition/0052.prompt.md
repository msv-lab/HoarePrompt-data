Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, and now `num` is assigned to an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be between 2 and 100, `start` is the minimum of the original `start` and `v`, `end` is `v` if the current value of `v` is less than 1000000000, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` equals 3, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer from input with the current value of 3, and `v` is an integer from input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `t` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `t` and `v` are updated to integers from input, and if `end > v`, then `end` remains `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and if `t` equals 3, `num` is a list containing the value `v`. If `t` does not equal 3, no changes are made to `n`, `i`, `t`, or `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
