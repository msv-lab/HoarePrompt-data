The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `string`, which is a string, and `substring`, which is a non-empty string and a substring of `string`. It returns a list containing all the starting positions where `substring` is found within `string`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, it returns a list containing only -1. Otherwise, it returns a list containing the starting positions of all occurrences of `substring` in `string`.
