The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space`, which is a string, and `to_int`, which is a boolean. If `to_int` is True, it splits the string `space` by spaces (if present) and converts each item to an integer, returning a list of integers. If `to_int` is False, it returns a list of strings or characters from the input string `space` based on whether it contains a space. The function reads an input line, processes it according to the given conditions, and returns a list of integers or strings/characters accordingly.
