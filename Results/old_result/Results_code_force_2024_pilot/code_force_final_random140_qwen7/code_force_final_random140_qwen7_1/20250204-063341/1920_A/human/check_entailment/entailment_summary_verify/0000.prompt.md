You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function processes a series of inputs to determine the count of valid numbers within a specified range. It first reads an integer `n` representing the number of inputs. For each input, it updates the minimum value (`start`) when `t` is 1, the maximum value (`end`) when `t` is 2, and appends the value (`v`) to the list `num` when `t` is 3. After processing all inputs, it counts how many numbers in `num` fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`. Finally, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus the count of valid numbers, or 0 if `end` is less than `start`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and calculate the valid range for `k`. Specifically, the logic for updating `start` and `end` is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `start` and `end` are initialized incorrectly. `start` is set to `-1`, which will not properly reflect the minimum value from the constraints.

2. **Constraint Handling**:
   - For `t == 1`, `start` should be updated to the maximum of its current value and `v`.
   - For `t == 2`, `end` should be updated to the minimum of its current value and `v`.

3. **Exclusion of Specific Values**:
   - The program correctly appends values to `num` that are excluded by `t == 3`.
   - However, the logic for counting these excluded values is incorrect. It should check if the excluded value lies within the range `[start, end]` and subtract the count of such values from the total range.

Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = float('inf')
    end = -float('inf')
    num = set()
    for _ in range(n):
        t, v = map(int, input().split())
        if t == 1:
            start = min(start, v)
        elif t == 2:
            end = max(end, v)
        elif t == 3:
            num.add(v)

    # Calculate the valid range
    valid_range = end - start + 1

    # Subtract the count of excluded values
    for v in num:
        if start <= v <= end:
            valid_range -= 1

    return valid_range
```

This corrected function ensures that:
- `start` and `end` are correctly initialized to represent the minimum and maximum bounds.
- The excluded values are correctly counted and subtracted from the valid range.
