Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then unpacked into the variables `t` and `v`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and still must be between 2 and 100, while `i` remains 2.
