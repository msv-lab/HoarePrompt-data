Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `num`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is `i + 1`
   - `t` is 0
   - `v` is `None`
   - `count_num` can be 0, 1, or 2 based on the condition of `i` being within or outside the range of `start` and `end`

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range of `num`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `num`, the variable `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `t` will remain 0 unless the loop body changes it.
   - `v` will remain `None` unless the loop body assigns a value to it.
   - `count_num` will remain unchanged unless the loop body changes it.

Given these points, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` will be updated to `i + 1`.
- `t` and `v` will remain as they are.
- `count_num` will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is `i + 2`, `t` is 0, `v` is `None`, and `count_num` remains either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether `i` is within or outside the range of `start` and `end`**.
