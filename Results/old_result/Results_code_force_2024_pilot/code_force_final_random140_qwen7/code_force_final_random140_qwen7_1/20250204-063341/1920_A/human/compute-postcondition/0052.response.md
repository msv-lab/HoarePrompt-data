Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` will be a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3, and `t` and `v` will be the last input integers processed by the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop:
- `n` remains the same as the initial input.
- `i` will be the total number of iterations minus one.
- `start` will hold the smallest value of `v` encountered when `t` was 1.
- `end` will hold the largest value of `v` encountered when `t` was 2.
- `num` will be a list of all values of `v` where `t` was 3.
- The last values of `t` and `v` entered into the loop will be the most recent inputs processed.
