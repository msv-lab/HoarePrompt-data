Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints.
2. The constraints are of three types:
   - \( k \geq x \)
   - \( k \leq x \)
   - \( k \neq x \)
3. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve this problem. Instead, it contains several helper functions that do not contribute to solving the main problem.
4. The function `func_7` is the only relevant function, but it still contains issues:
   - It initializes `start` to `-1`, which will never be updated to a valid starting point if no lower bound constraint is present.
   - It does not handle the case where there are conflicting constraints (e.g., a lower bound and an upper bound that do not overlap).
   - It does not correctly account for the "not equal" constraints.
5. The logic in `func_7` should:
   - Find the minimum lower bound (`start`) from all constraints of type 1.
   - Find the maximum upper bound (`end`) from all constraints of type 2.
   - Subtract the number of values excluded by constraints of type 3 from the range `[start, end]`.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
