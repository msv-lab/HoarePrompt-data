Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `num` is a list containing the value `v`.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `num` was not defined before, it is assumed to be an empty list initially. After appending `v`, `num` now contains `v`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
