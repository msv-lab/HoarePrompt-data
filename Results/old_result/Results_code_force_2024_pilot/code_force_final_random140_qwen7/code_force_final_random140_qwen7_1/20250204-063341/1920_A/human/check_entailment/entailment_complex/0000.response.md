Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1(isOne)`**: This function correctly handles the input based on the boolean value `isOne`. It either returns 1 or reads an integer from the standard input. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to handle different types of inputs.

2. **Function `func_2(space, to_int)`**: This function reads a line of input and processes it based on the `to_int` flag. It correctly splits the input into a list of strings or integers, which is necessary for parsing the constraints. However, the function `func_2` is not used in the main program, so it doesn't affect the correctness directly.

3. **Function `func_3(arr, sym)`**: This function concatenates a list of integers into a string with a specified separator. It is not used in the main program, so it doesn't impact the correctness.

4. **Function `func_4(string, substring)`**: This function finds all occurrences of a substring within a string. It is not used in the main program, so it doesn't impact the correctness.

5. **Function `func_5(arr, element)`**: This function returns the indices of a specific element in a list. It is not used in the main program, so it doesn't impact the correctness.

6. **Function `func_6(arr, index, value)`**: This function returns the first sub-array where the specified element is either equal to or not equal to the given value. It is not used in the main program, so it doesn't impact the correctness.

7. **Function `func_7()`**: This function correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It initializes `start` and `end` based on the constraints and updates them accordingly. It also collects all `v` values where `t` is 3 into the list `num`. After processing all constraints, it counts the number of valid integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`. Finally, it returns the correct count based on the range and the count of invalid numbers.

Given that all functions are correctly implemented and the main program logic is sound, the program meets the problem requirements and handles all constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
