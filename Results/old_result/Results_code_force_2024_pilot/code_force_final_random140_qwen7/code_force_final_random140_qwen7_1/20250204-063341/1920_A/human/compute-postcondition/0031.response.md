Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `start` is `v`, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` equals 3, `t` is an integer from input with the current value of 3, `v` is an integer from input, `t` is updated to an integer from input, `v` is updated to an integer from input.**

Explanation: The code `end = v` simply assigns the value of `v` to `end`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `v` is an integer input, and its value is used to update `end`, the precondition that `end` is `v` if the current value of `v` is less than 1000000000 remains valid.
