Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is 1 more than the initial value of `i`.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `v` is `None`.
   - `count_num` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the value of `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in num:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range defined by `num`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust its value.
   - The value of `i` must be the next value in the sequence defined by `num`.

Given the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the initial value of `i` was `start`. Therefore, `n` would be `start + 1`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` should be the next value in the sequence defined by `num`.
- `n` should be updated to be `i + 1`.
- `t` remains 0.
- `v` remains `None`.
- `count_num` remains either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`.

Since the exact sequence of `num` is not specified, we can only say that `i` will be the next value in the sequence.

**Final State:**
- `n` is `i + 1`.
- `t` is 0.
- `v` is `None`.
- `count_num` remains either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is `i + 1`, `t` is 0, `v` is `None`, and `count_num` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`.**
