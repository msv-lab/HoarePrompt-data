Output State: **`n` is 1 more than the initial value of `i`, `t` is 0, `v` is None, `count_num` is 0, and the current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `n`, `t`, `v`, `count_num`, and the condition on `i` remain unchanged.
