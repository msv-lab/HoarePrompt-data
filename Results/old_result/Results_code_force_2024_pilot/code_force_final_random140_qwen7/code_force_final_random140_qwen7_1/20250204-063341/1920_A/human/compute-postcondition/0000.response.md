Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, and `num` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided, but since no specific input is given, we only know that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 based on the initial state.
