Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly determine whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the `if` statement is flawed:

1. **Condition `n < m`:** This condition is incorrect because it only checks if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, which is not relevant to the problem.
2. **Bitwise AND conditions (`n & 1 and m & 1` or `n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0`):** These conditions check if both `n` and `m` are odd or even, respectively. However, this does not guarantee that the operations can result in exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. 

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even, since each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing one cube).

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This solution checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which ensures that it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
