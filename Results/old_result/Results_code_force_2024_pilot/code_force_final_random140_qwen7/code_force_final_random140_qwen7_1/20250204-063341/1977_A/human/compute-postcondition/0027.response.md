Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). It does not return a specific value but processes the given integers and may output results or perform operations based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers: t, n, and m, within specified ranges. The exact operations or outputs are not detailed here, but the function processes these integers according to the given constraints.
