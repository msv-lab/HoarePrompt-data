Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will include a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions provided within the loop body for each pair of integers \(n\) and \(m\) entered. Specifically, for each pair:

- If \(n < m\), the output will be 'NO'.
- Otherwise, if \(n\) and \(m\) are both odd or both even, the output will be 'YES'. 

All other variables outside the loop (such as the initial value of \(t\)) will retain their original values from the initial state, assuming no further inputs or modifications are made outside the loop during its execution.
