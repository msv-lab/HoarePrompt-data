Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where the number of moves `n` is odd and the desired number of cubes `m` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, so the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` should be the same. However, the current implementation checks only the parity of `n` and `m` separately and prints 'YES' if they are both odd or both even. This logic is insufficient because it does not account for the fact that the total number of moves must equal the change in the number of cubes.

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `m = 2`. Here, `n` is odd and `m` is even, but the program would incorrectly print 'YES'. The correct approach would be to check if `abs(n - m)` is even, which ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is achievable through a series of additions and removals of one cube at a time.
