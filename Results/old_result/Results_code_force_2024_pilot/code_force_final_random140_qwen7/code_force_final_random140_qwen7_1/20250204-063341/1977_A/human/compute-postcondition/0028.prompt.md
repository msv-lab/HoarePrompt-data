You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will include a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions provided within the loop body for each pair of integers \(n\) and \(m\) entered. Specifically, for each pair:
    #
    #- If \(n < m\), the output will be 'NO'.
    #- Otherwise, if \(n\) and \(m\) are both odd or both even, the output will be 'YES'. 
    #
    #All other variables outside the loop (such as the initial value of \(t\)) will retain their original values from the initial state, assuming no further inputs or modifications are made outside the loop during its execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). It does not return a specific value but processes the given integers and may output results or perform operations based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
