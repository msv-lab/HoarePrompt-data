Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, and they are either both odd or both even, and they are now equal to the integers entered by the user; the next input must be a positive integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It does not change the condition that `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. The precondition that the next input must be a positive integer remains unchanged.
