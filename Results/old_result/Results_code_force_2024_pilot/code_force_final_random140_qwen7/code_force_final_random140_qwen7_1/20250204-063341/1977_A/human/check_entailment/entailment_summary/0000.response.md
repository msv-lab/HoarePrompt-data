Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly \(m\) cubes after \(n\) moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube.
- The given solution correctly handles the condition where \(n < m\), which would always result in a "NO" because it's impossible to add more cubes than the total number of moves.
- However, the logic for checking if both \(n\) and \(m\) are either both odd or both even is flawed. This condition does not accurately reflect the necessary and sufficient conditions for the problem. Specifically:
  - If \(n\) is odd and \(m\) is even, or vice versa, it's impossible to achieve \(m\) cubes after \(n\) moves because the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes added/removed must match the parity of \(n\).
  - The current logic incorrectly allows "YES" when \(n\) and \(m\) have different parities, which is incorrect.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
