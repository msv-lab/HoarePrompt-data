Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes exactly one cube.
2. The annotated program correctly processes each test case by reading `n` and `m` for each test case.
3. The logic in the program checks if `n < m`. If true, it prints 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves without removing cubes.
4. The program then checks if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even. This condition is correct because:
   - If both `n` and `m` are odd, it means the number of additions must equal the number of removals plus an additional addition to reach `m` from `n`.
   - If both `n` and `m` are even, it means the number of additions must equal the number of removals minus an additional removal to reach `m` from `n`.
5. The program correctly handles all test cases as per the examples provided.

Given this analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
