Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. This means that the loop will execute once for each positive integer input.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**: We know that the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration was that `n` and `m` are integers and they are either both odd or both even.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide a positive integer as input. Therefore, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

5. **Update the state**: Since the loop head involves `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers and they are either both odd or both even, and the next input must be a positive integer**.
