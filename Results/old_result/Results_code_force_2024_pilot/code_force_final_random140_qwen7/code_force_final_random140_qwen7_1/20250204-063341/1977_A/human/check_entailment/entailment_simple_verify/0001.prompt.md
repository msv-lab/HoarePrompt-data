You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will include a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions provided within the loop body for each pair of integers \(n\) and \(m\) entered. Specifically, for each pair:
    #
    #- If \(n < m\), the output will be 'NO'.
    #- Otherwise, if \(n\) and \(m\) are both odd or both even, the output will be 'YES'. 
    #
    #All other variables outside the loop (such as the initial value of \(t\)) will retain their original values from the initial state, assuming no further inputs or modifications are made outside the loop during its execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move either adds or removes exactly one cube.
   - After `n` moves, the number of cubes added must equal the number of cubes removed plus `m`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     1. If `n < m`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it's not always true that `n < m` when `m` cubes cannot be achieved.
     2. The second condition checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even using the bitwise AND operation (`&`). This is a correct approach because the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` must match for the operations to balance out correctly.

3. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - The first condition `if n < m:` is incorrect. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it should be possible to achieve `m` cubes, but the code incorrectly returns 'NO'.
   - The second condition correctly ensures that the parity of `n` and `m` matches, which is necessary for the operations to result in `m` cubes.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code should check if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both odd or both even) without checking `n < m`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if (n % 2 == m % 2):  # Check if n and m have the same parity
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original code is incorrect because it incorrectly checks `n < m`. The corrected version checks the parity of `n` and `m` and prints 'YES' if they have the same parity, which is the correct approach.
