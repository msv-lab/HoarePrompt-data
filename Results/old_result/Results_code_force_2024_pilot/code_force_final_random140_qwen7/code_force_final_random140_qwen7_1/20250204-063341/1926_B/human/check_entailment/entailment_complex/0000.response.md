Reasoning:

The provided function does not correctly identify whether the shape formed by '1's in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes**:
   - The function checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1' (`s.count('1') == 1`). If any row has exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'Triangle'.
   - If no row has exactly one '1', it sets `b` to 'Square'.
   
   This logic is flawed because:
   - For a triangle, there can be multiple rows with more than one '1', as long as they follow the pattern of a triangle.
   - For a square, there can be multiple rows with more than one '1', as long as they are evenly spaced and form a square.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the following grid for a triangle:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     According to the current logic, this would be identified as a 'Triangle' because one of the rows has exactly one '1'. However, it should be identified as a 'Triangle'.

   - Consider the following grid for a square:
     ```
     111
     101
     111
     ```
     According to the current logic, this would be identified as a 'Square' because no row has exactly one '1'. However, it should be identified as a 'Square'.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify the shape, the function needs to check the pattern of '1's in the grid.
   - For a triangle, check if the '1's form a triangular pattern.
   - For a square, check if the '1's form a square pattern.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly identify the shapes in the grid.

Correctness: **False**
