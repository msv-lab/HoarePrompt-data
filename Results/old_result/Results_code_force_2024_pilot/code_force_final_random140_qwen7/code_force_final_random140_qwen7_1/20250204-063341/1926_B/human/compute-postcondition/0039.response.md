Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < t`. At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `i` is currently 1 (since it was not affected by the loop and started from 1).
   - `t` is the total number of times the loop will run, which is `j + 1` (from the postcondition).
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and is incremented by 1 at each iteration, after the first iteration (`i = 1`), `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must be at least 2.

Based on this reasoning, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` will be 2 and `t` must be at least 2.

**State:**
- `i` is 2
- `t` must be at least 2

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2**
