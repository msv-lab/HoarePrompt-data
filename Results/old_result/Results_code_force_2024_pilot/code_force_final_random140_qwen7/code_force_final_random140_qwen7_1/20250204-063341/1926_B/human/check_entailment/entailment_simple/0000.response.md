Reasoning:
1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly identify whether the '1's form a triangle or a square.
2. The logic in the program is flawed because:
   - It sets `a` to 'Triangle' if any row has exactly one '1'. However, this does not guarantee that the entire shape is a triangle. For example, if there are multiple rows with exactly one '1', it could indicate a square rather than a triangle.
   - It sets `b` to 'Square' if any row has more than one '1'. This is also problematic because it does not account for the specific pattern required to form a square or a triangle.
3. The program fails to check the necessary conditions for a triangle or a square, such as the positions of '1's in each row and column for a triangle, and the uniform distance for a square.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
