Output State: **All iterations of the loop have finished, with `i` being equal to `t`, `t` being the total number of times the loop ran, `n` being the total number of inputs received during the last iteration, `a` being 'Triangle' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1', and `b` being 'Square' if any of the input strings had more than one '1', and remaining an empty string if no such string was entered.**

In this final state, `i` will be equal to `t`, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `t` will be the total number of times the loop ran. The variable `n` will be the number of inputs received during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `a` will be 'Triangle' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1'. The variable `b` will be 'Square' if any of the input strings had more than one '1', and will remain an empty string if no such string was entered.
