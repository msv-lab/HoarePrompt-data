Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', `s` is the input string received from the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The new state of `s` is the string input by the user.
