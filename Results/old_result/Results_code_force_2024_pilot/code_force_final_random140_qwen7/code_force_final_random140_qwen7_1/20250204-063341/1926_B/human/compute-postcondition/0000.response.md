Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The grid and n remain unchanged.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is updated to this value. However, the grid representation and the value of `n` (which is an integer between 2 and 10) remain unchanged from their initial state.
