Output State: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` is the input integer provided initially, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is the last string input by the user during the loop execution. If any of the strings `s` had exactly one '1' in it, `a` would be set to 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0. The value of `t` will be equal to `n` since the loop runs `n` times, and `i` remains 2 as it was not modified within the loop.
