Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', `s` is the new input string from the user, `j` is 5**

Explanation: The code `a = 'Triangle'` simply reassigns the variable `a` to the string `'Triangle'`. Since the initial state already had `a` as `'Triangle'`, there is no change in the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
