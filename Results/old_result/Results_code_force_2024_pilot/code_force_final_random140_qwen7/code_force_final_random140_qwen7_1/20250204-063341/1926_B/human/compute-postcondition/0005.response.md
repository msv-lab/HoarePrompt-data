Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the input `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is not initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0 as per the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not part of the loop head).
- `i` is 1 (though this variable is not part of the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer (though this variable is part of the loop head).
- `a` is 0 (though this variable is not part of the loop head).
- `b` is an empty string (though this variable is not part of the loop head).

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `n` must be at least 1. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`) do not affect the loop's execution and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State: **`n` must be at least 1**
