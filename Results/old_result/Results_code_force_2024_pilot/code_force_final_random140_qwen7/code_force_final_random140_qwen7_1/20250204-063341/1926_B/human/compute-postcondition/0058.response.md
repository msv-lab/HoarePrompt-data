Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is the input string received from the user.**

The code snippet `b = 'Square'` assigns the string `'Square'` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
