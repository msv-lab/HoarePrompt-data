Postcondition: `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'Square'.
