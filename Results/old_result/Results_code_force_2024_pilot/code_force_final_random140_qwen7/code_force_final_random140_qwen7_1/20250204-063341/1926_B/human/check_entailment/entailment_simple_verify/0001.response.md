### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining whether a given grid contains a triangle or a square made up of `1`s.
2. **Input Analysis**: 
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case starts with the size of the grid `n`.
   - Followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters (`0` or `1`).
3. **Shape Characteristics**:
   - **Triangle**: Consists of `k` rows where the `i-th` row has `2*i-1` `1`s centered in one column.
   - **Square**: Consists of `k` rows where each row has `k` `1`s evenly spaced from the left edge.
4. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and processes each row.
   - It checks if any row contains exactly one `1` and sets `a` to `'Triangle'`.
   - If no row contains exactly one `1`, it checks if any row contains more than one `1` and sets `b` to `'Square'`.
   - Finally, it prints either `'Triangle'` or `'Square'`.

### Issues with the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Triangle Detection**:
   - The program only checks if any row contains exactly one `1`. This does not correctly identify a triangle because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one `1`.
   - For example, consider the following grid:
     ```
     4
     0000
     0000
     0110
     1111
     ```
     The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because it finds more than one `1` in the third and fourth rows, even though the entire shape forms a triangle.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Square Detection**:
   - Similarly, the program only checks if any row contains more than one `1`. This does not correctly identify a square because a square can have multiple rows with more than one `1` but they must be evenly spaced.
   - For example, consider the following grid:
     ```
     4
     0000
     0000
     0100
     1110
     ```
     The program would incorrectly identify this as a triangle because it finds more than one `1` in the third row, even though the entire shape forms a square.

### Example Counter-Example:
Consider the following grid:
```
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```
- The program would incorrectly identify this as a triangle because it finds more than one `1` in the third row.
- However, this grid actually forms a square.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly identify the shapes (triangles or squares) in the grid based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
