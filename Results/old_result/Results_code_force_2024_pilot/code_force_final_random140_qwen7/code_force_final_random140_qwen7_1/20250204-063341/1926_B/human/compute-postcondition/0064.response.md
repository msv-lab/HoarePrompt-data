Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is 'Square', `s` is the string input by the user**.

The code `a = 'Triangle'` assigns the string `'Triangle'` to the variable `a`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `b`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
