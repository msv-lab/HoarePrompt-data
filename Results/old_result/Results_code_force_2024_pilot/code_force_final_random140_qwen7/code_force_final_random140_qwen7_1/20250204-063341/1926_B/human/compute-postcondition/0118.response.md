Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `t` must be at least 2.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `a` is 'Triangle'.
- `b` is either an empty string or 'Square' depending on the last input string `s`.
- `s` is the final input string from the user.
- `j` is equal to `n` + 1.
- The current value of `a` is not 0.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`.

Given that `a` is explicitly stated to be 'Triangle', the output will be:

Output: **'Triangle'**
