You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string contains n characters which are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.

    t = int(input())

    #State: All iterations of the loop have finished, with `i` being equal to `t`, `t` being the total number of times the loop ran, `n` being the total number of inputs received during the last iteration, `a` being 'Triangle' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'Square' if all input strings had more than one '1', and `b` being 'Square' if any of the input strings had more than one '1', and remaining an empty string if no such string was entered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of grids, each represented as a list of n strings containing '0's and '1's. It determines whether the shape formed by '1's in each grid is a triangle or a square. If any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', it prints 'Triangle'. Otherwise, it prints 'Square'. The function runs this check for each of the t test cases provided. After processing all test cases, it outputs the determined shape for each grid.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify either triangles or squares in the grid. Let's analyze why:

1. **Triangle Detection**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to determine a triangle. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   000
   010
   011
   ```
   This grid contains a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because no row has exactly one '1'.

2. **Square Detection**: The program checks if any row contains more than one '1'. If so, it assumes a square. However, this is also insufficient. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   000
   011
   011
   ```
   This grid contains a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the second and third rows both have two '1's.

To correctly identify the shapes, the program needs to check for the specific patterns of a triangle and a square. Here’s a brief outline of how the correct solution might look:

1. **Triangle Check**: Check if there exists a central column with '1's forming a triangle pattern.
2. **Square Check**: Check if there exists a central column with '1's forming a square pattern.

Given these points, the provided program does not handle the necessary checks for both shapes correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
