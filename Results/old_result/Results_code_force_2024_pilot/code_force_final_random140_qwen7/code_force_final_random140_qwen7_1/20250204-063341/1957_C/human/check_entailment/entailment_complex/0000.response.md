### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves where you and the computer place rooks alternately. The rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - After \(k\) moves, the remaining empty positions on the board can be split into two categories: positions that are neither attacked nor mirrored and positions that are attacked but not mirrored.
   - The function `helper` is designed to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining unoccupied positions under the given constraints.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function initializes a dictionary `dp` and calls the `helper` function with the remaining size of the board (`x`).
     - The `helper` function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations recursively.
   - **`helper`**:
     - Base Case: If `len` (number of unoccupied rows and columns) is less than or equal to 0, it returns 1.
     - Recursive Case: It checks if the result for `len` is already computed and stored in `dp`. If so, it returns the stored value.
     - Otherwise, it computes the result using the formula:
       \[
       y = \text{helper}(len - 1) + 2 \times (len - 1) \times \text{helper}(len - 2)
       \]
     - It stores the computed value in `dp` and returns it.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `helper` correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
   - The use of memoization (via `dp`) ensures efficient computation by avoiding redundant calculations.
   - The base case and recursive step are correctly implemented to handle all possible scenarios.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
