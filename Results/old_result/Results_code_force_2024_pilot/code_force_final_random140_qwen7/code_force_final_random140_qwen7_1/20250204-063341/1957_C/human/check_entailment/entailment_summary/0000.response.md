Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of valid moves by the player and the computer. The player starts first and places a white rook, and the computer mirrors the move by placing a black rook. If the player's move is along the diagonal (i.e., the row and column indices are the same), the computer skips its turn.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions of the chessboard (`n`) and the number of moves already made (`k`).
   - For each move, it checks if the row and column indices are the same. If they are not, it reduces the effective size of the board by 2 (since both a white and a black rook are placed). If they are the same, it reduces the effective size by 1 (only one rook is placed).

3. **Functions Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the number of possible configurations using the `helper` function.
   - **helper**: This recursive function calculates the number of configurations using dynamic programming. It uses memoization to store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the main loop correctly updates the size of the board based on the moves made.
   - The `helper` function correctly computes the number of configurations for the remaining board space using a recursive approach with memoization.
   - The overall structure of the solution matches the problem requirements.

Based on the above analysis, the given code appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided execution summaries.

Correctness: **True**
