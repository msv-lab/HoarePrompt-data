#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the size of the remaining empty chessboard, where the chessboard is initially of size n \times n and k moves have already been made.
def func_1(x):
    dp = {}
    return helper(x)
    #The program returns the result of the helper function with input 'x', where 'x' is an integer representing the size of the remaining empty chessboard.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` representing the size of the remaining empty chessboard and returns the result of the `helper` function using this input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a positive integer representing the number of unoccupied rows and columns left on the chessboard after the k moves have been made.
def helper(len):
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: len is a positive integer representing the number of unoccupied rows and columns left on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value stored in dp at the index equal to the current number of unoccupied rows and columns left on the chessboard, which is greater than 0.
    #State: len is a positive integer representing the number of unoccupied rows and columns left on the chessboard after the k moves have been made, and len is greater than 0, and len is not in dp
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns a value 'y', which is defined as x1 + x2, where x1 is the value returned by helper(len - 1), and x2 is 2 * (len - 1) * the value returned by helper(len - 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `helper` accepts a positive integer `len`, which represents the number of unoccupied rows and columns left on the chessboard after the k moves have been made. It returns either 1, a precomputed value stored in `dp` at the index equal to `len`, or a calculated value based on recursive calls to itself with decremented `len` values.
