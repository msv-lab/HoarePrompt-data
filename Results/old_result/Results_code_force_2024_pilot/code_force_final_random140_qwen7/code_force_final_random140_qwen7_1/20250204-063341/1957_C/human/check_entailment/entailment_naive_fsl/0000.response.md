Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` and `helper` functions do not account for the actual placement of rooks on the chessboard and the constraints of the problem.

The `helper` function calculates a value based on the length parameter, but this calculation does not reflect the number of valid configurations of rooks on the chessboard. The function seems to be calculating something related to permutations or combinations, but it does not consider the constraints of the rook placement problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to calculate the number of valid configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) board after \(k\) moves, considering the mirroring effect of the computer's moves. This involves dynamic programming or combinatorial calculations that take into account the positions of the rooks and the constraints of no two rooks attacking each other.

Since the provided code does not address these requirements, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem description.
