Output State: **`len` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not in dp, `x1` is the value returned by helper(len - 1)**

Explanation: The variable `x1` is assigned the value returned by the function `helper(len - 1)`. Since `len` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not in `dp`, `len - 1` will also be a positive integer (since subtracting 1 from a positive integer still results in a positive integer). The function `helper` is called with this new value, and `x1` will hold the return value of this function call. All other variables remain unchanged.
