Output State: **`len` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not in dp, `x1` is the value returned by helper(len - 1), `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)**.

Explanation: The value of `len` remains a positive integer greater than 0 and not in dp. The value of `x1` remains the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`. The new variable `x2` is assigned the value `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`. Therefore, the updated output state includes these changes.
