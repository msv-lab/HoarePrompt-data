x is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a move you made during the game. Each tuple contains two integers (r, c) denoting the row and column of the move. The length of the list is equal to k, and it is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Additionally, n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
