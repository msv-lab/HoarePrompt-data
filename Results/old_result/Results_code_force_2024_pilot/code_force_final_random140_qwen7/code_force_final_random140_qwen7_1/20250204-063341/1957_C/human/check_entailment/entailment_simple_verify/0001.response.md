### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves an \(n \times n\) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - You start by placing a rook at position \((r, c)\), and the computer mirrors this move by placing a rook at \((c, r)\).
   - If \(r = c\), the computer cannot mirror the move and skips its turn.
   - The goal is to calculate the number of possible final configurations after \(k\) moves, considering the mirroring rule and the no-attack constraint.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code provided includes two functions: `func_1` and `helper`.
   - `func_1` calls `helper` with an argument `x`, but the value of `x` is not defined in the context of the problem.
   - `helper` is a recursive function that calculates a value using dynamic programming.

3. **Understanding the `helper` Function:**
   - The base case of `helper` is when `len <= 0`, returning 1.
   - If the length is already computed, it returns the stored value.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calculates values for `len - 1` and `len - 2` and combines them to get the result for `len`.

4. **Matching the Problem to the Code:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations, which seems to be related to the combinatorial nature of placing rooks without attacking each other.
   - The `helper` function is designed to compute a value that corresponds to the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board of size `len \times len` after a certain number of moves.
   - The function `func_1` should initialize the dynamic programming table and call `helper` with the appropriate argument.

5. **Correctness of the Code:**
   - The `helper` function correctly computes the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board of size `len \times len` using a recursive approach with memoization.
   - The `func_1` function initializes the dynamic programming table and calls `helper` with the correct argument `n - k - 1`, which represents the number of unoccupied rows and columns after the `k` moves have been made.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and during the execution of `func_1` and `helper`.
   - The logic in the main loop correctly updates the size of the board after each move, ensuring that the `helper` function is called with the correct argument.

### Conclusion:
- The provided code correctly implements the solution to the given problem. The `helper` function is designed to compute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board of size `len \times len`, and `func_1` initializes the dynamic programming table and calls `helper` with the correct argument.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
