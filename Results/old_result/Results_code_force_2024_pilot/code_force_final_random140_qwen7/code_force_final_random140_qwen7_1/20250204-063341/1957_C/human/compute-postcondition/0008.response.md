Output State: **`len` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not in dp, `y` is `x1 + x2`, `x1` is the value returned by helper(len - 1), `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)**.

This means that the value of `y` is calculated as the sum of `x1` and `x2`. The values of `len`, `x1`, and `x2` remain as per their initial conditions. The precondition that `len` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not in `dp` is still valid.
