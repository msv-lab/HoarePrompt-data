Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the logic and the execution summary:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It takes two parameters, `n` and `k`.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it returns 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns `n`.

2. **Execution Summary**:
   - The function correctly handles the condition where `k` is large enough to disconnect all but one island from island 1.
   - When `k < n - 1`, the function correctly returns `n`, meaning all islands remain reachable from island 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k >= n - 1`, destroying `n - 1` bridges would isolate island 1 from all other islands, leaving only island 1 reachable.
   - When `k < n - 1`, since there are more than `k` bridges remaining, all islands remain reachable from island 1.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly determines the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the optimal bridge destruction strategy by Dominater.

Correctness: **True**
