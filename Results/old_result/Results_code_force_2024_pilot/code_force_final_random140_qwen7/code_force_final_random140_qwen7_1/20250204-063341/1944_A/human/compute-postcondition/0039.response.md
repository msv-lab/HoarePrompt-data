Output State: **`k` is `k - (n - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `k - n`, and `reachable_count` is `n - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.**

Given the initial conditions:
- `k` is `k - n` and must be greater than or equal to `n - 2` and greater than 0.
- `reachable_count` is `n - 1`.

After executing the line `k -= reachable_count - 1`:
- `reachable_count` is updated to `n - 2`.
- `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `k - n`.

Therefore, the output state is `k` is `k - n`, and `reachable_count` is `n - 2`.
