Output State: **`k` is `n - (reachable_count - 1)`, `reachable_count` is `n - 1`**

Explanation: Initially, `reachable_count` is `n - 1`. The code `k -= reachable_count - 1` subtracts `reachable_count - 1` from `k`. Since `reachable_count` is `n - 1`, `reachable_count - 1` equals `n - 2`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - (n - 2)`. Given the initial condition that `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the updated value of `k` is `n - 1 - (n - 2)`, which simplifies to `1`. However, since the exact initial value of `k` is not specified, we express `k` as `n - (reachable_count - 1)`, which is `n - (n - 2)`, resulting in `2`. The value of `reachable_count` remains unchanged at `n - 1`.
