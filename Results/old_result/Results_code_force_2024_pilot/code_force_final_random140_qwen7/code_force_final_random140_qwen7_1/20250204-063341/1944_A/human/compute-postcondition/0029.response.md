Output State: reachable_count is 1, k is 0.

Explanation: Given that `n` is less than or equal to 5, after the loop executes 3 times, we have `reachable_count` as `n - 3` and `k` as `n - 5`. Since `reachable_count` decreases by 1 each iteration and `k` decreases by `reachable_count - 1` each iteration, when `reachable_count` reaches 1, `k` will be reduced to 0 because `k` is now `n - 5` and `reachable_count - 1` is 0, making the subtraction from `k` zero. Therefore, the loop terminates when `reachable_count` becomes 1, leaving `k` at 0.
