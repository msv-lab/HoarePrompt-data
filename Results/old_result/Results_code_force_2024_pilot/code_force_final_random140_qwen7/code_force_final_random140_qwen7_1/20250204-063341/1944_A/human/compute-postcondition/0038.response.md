Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is `k - n`
   - `reachable_count` is `n - 1`

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves two variables: `k` and `reachable_count`.

4. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `k >= reachable_count - 1` and `k > 0` must be true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `reachable_count` is fixed at `n - 1`, we cannot change this value directly.
   - We need to ensure that `k` satisfies both conditions:
     - `k >= reachable_count - 1` becomes `k >= (n - 1) - 1` or `k >= n - 2`.
     - `k > 0` remains as `k > 0`.

6. **Combine the Conditions**:
   - To satisfy both conditions, `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 2` and greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 2` and greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is `k - n` and `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 2` and greater than 0, `reachable_count` is `n - 1`**
