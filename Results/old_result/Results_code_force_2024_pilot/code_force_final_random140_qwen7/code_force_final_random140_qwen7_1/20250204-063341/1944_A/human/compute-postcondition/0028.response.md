Output State: **`k` is `n - 5`, `reachable_count` is `n - 3`, and `n` is less than or equal to 5.**

Explanation: The value of `reachable_count` is decreased by 1. Initially, `k` is calculated as `n - 2 * 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 5`. Similarly, `reachable_count` is initially `n - 2`. After decrementing `reachable_count` by 1, its new value becomes `n - 3`. The condition that `n` must be less than or equal to 5 remains unchanged.
