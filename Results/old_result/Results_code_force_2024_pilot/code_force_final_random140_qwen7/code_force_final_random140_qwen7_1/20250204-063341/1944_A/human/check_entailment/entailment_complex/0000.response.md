Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit based on the values of `n` and `k`. Let's analyze the logic of the function:

1. **Case when \( k \geq n - 1 \):**
   - If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \), the function returns 1.
     - This means that if Dominater can destroy at least \( n - 1 \) bridges, Everule will be isolated from all other islands except island 1. Therefore, Everule can only visit 1 island (island 1).
   
2. **Case when \( k < n - 1 \):**
   - If \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \), the function returns \( n \).
     - This means that even if Dominater destroys fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges, Everule can still visit all \( n \) islands because the graph remains connected enough to allow travel to any island from island 1.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the function, the function correctly implements the required behavior. It ensures that:
- If \( k \) is large enough to disconnect all but one island, Everule can only visit 1 island.
- Otherwise, Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.

The function matches the problem description and handles all possible values of \( n \) and \( k \) within their specified ranges.

Correctness: **True**
