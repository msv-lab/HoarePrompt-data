Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by `k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `reachable_count` is `n - 1`.
   - `k` is `k - n + 1`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied:
     1. `k >= reachable_count - 1`
     2. `k > 0`

4. **Analyze the first condition (`k >= reachable_count - 1`)**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `reachable_count` is `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `k >= (n - 1) - 1` or `k >= n - 2`.
   - To ensure this condition holds true for the next iteration, `k` must be at least `n - 1`.

5. **Analyze the second condition (`k > 0`)**:
   - This condition is already satisfied since `k` is `k - n + 1` and we know `k` is positive.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `k` must be at least `n - 1` for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `k` is `n - 1` or greater.
   - The value of `reachable_count` remains `n - 1` as it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`reachable_count` is n - 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to n - 1**
