Output State: **`k` is `k - 2 * (reachable_count - 1) + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `reachable_count` is equal to `reachable_count - 1`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1` and greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `reachable_count -= 1` decreases the value of `reachable_count` by 1. Since `reachable_count` was previously decreased by 1, the new value of `reachable_count` is now `reachable_count - 1`. All other conditions and relationships involving `k` and `reachable_count` remain unchanged.
