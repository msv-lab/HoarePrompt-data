Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. Everule starts on island 1 and can travel through bridges.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is called with these values.
   - The function `func_1` checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If true, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic of `func_1`**:
   - If `k >= n - 1`, it means that Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If `k < n - 1`, it means that not enough bridges are destroyed to isolate island 1 completely, so Everule can visit all `n` islands.

4. **Verification Against Examples**:
   - For the test case `2 0`: `n = 2`, `k = 0`. Since `k < n - 1`, the function should return `2`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the test case `2 1`: `n = 2`, `k = 1`. Since `k >= n - 1`, the function should return `1`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the test case `4 1`: `n = 4`, `k = 1`. Since `k < n - 1`, the function should return `4`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the test case `5 10`: `n = 5`, `k = 10`. Since `k >= n - 1`, the function should return `1`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the test case `5 3`: `n = 5`, `k = 3`. Since `k < n - 1`, the function should return `5`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the test case `4 4`: `n = 4`, `k = 4`. Since `k >= n - 1`, the function should return `1`, which matches the expected output.

Given that the logic in `func_1` correctly handles all edge cases and examples provided, the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
