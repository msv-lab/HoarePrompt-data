Output State: `k` is `k - n + 1`, `reachable_count` is `n - 1`.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, `k` is reduced by `reachable_count - 1` and `reachable_count` itself is reduced by 1. If we continue this process until `k` is less than `reachable_count - 1` or becomes 0, we can see that after `n-1` iterations, `k` will be reduced by `2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n-1)/2 - (n-1) = (n-1)(n-2)/2` and `reachable_count` will be reduced to 1. However, since `k` is also adjusted by adding 1 back each time, the net effect is that `k` is reduced by `n-1` and `reachable_count` is reduced to 1. Therefore, after all iterations, `k` will be `k - n + 1` and `reachable_count` will be `n - 1`.
