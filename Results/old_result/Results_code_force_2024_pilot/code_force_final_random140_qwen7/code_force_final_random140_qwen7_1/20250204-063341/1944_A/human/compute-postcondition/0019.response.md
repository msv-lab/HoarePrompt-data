Output State: **`reachable_count` is set to `n`, `k` is reduced to `k - (n - 1) - (n - 1)`, and both `k` and `reachable_count - 1` are greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_count` to `n`. The value of `k` remains unchanged from its previous state, which was `k - (n - 1) - (n - 1)`. Both `k` and `reachable_count - 1` are still greater than 0, as no operations were performed on them that would alter this condition.
