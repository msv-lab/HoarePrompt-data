Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given as:
   ```
   while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
   ```

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `k - n`
   - `reachable_count` is `n - 3`

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `reachable_count`.

4. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The first part of the condition is `k >= reachable_count - 1`.
   - The second part of the condition is `k > 0`.

5. **Check the Current Values:**
   - From the current state, we know `k - n` (let's denote this as `k_val`).
   - We also know `reachable_count` is `n - 3`.

6. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, both conditions must be true:
     1. `k >= reachable_count - 1`
     2. `k > 0`

7. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `k` is `k_val + n`, we need to ensure `k_val + n >= (n - 3) - 1` and `k_val + n > 0`.
   - Simplifying the first condition: `k_val + n >= n - 4` → `k_val >= -4`. This condition is always true since `k_val` is an integer and `k_val >= 0` (assuming non-negative integers).
   - Simplifying the second condition: `k_val + n > 0` → `k_val > -n`. Since `k_val` is non-negative, this condition is also always true.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The only relevant state to adjust is `reachable_count` to ensure the loop condition holds. Specifically, `reachable_count` should be such that the loop can continue.

### Final Answer

The variables in the loop head are `k` and `reachable_count`, so we can only adjust those. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `reachable_count` must be such that the loop condition holds. Given that `reachable_count` is `n - 3`, we need to ensure that `k` remains valid and the loop condition is met.

State: **`k - n`, `reachable_count` must be `n - 3` and `k` must satisfy `k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0`**
