Output State: **`k` is `k - 2 * reachable_count + 1`, `reachable_count` is `reachable_count - 2`, and both `k` and `reachable_count - 2` are greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `reachable_count -= 1` decreases the value of `reachable_count` by 1. Initially, `reachable_count` was `reachable_count - 1`. After the decrement, `reachable_count` becomes `reachable_count - 2`. The value of `k` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is `k - 2 * (reachable_count - 1) + 1 - (reachable_count - 1)`. Therefore, the updated expression for `k` becomes `k - 2 * reachable_count + 1`.
