Output State: **`k` is `k - 2 * reachable_count + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `reachable_count` is decreased by 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1` and greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `k -= reachable_count - 1` subtracts `reachable_count - 1` from `k`. Given the initial state, `k` was originally `k - reachable_count`. After executing the code, `k` becomes `(k - reachable_count) - (reachable_count - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2 * reachable_count + 1`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 and `k` must be at least `n - 1` remains unchanged. Additionally, `reachable_count` is decreased by 1, and `k` must still be greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1` and greater than 0.
