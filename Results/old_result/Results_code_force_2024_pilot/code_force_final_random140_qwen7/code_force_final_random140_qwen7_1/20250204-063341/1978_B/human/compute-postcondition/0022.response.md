Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `b` is now equal to the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a`**.

This means that the variable `profit` has been calculated as the product of `n` and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
