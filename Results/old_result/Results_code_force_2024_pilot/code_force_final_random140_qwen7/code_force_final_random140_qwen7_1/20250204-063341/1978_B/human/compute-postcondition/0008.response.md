Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `n` is the first element of the list `x`.
- `a` is the second element of the list `x`.
- `b` is the third element of the list `x`.
- `profit` is calculated as `n * a`.

The `print(profit)` statement will print the value of `profit`, which is `n * a`.

Since `n` is the first element of the list `x` and `a` is the second element of the list `x`, the value of `profit` is the product of these two elements.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **n * a (where n is the first element and a is the second element of the list x)**
