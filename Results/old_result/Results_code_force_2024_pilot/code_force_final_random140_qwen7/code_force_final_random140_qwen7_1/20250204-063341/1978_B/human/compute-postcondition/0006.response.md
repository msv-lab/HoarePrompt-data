Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `n` is the first element of the list `x`; `a` is the second element of the list `x`; `b` is the third element of the list `x`; `profit` is `n * a`.**

The code calculates the profit as `n * a`, where `n` is the first element of the list `x` and `a` is the second element of the list `x`. The value of `b` remains unchanged, and the values of `t` and `x` also remain unchanged.
