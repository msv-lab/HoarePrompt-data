Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`, `profit` is `n * a`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` to be the minimum between `n - 1` and `b - a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
