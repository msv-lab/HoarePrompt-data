Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). It calculates and prints a profit value based on these inputs. If \( a \geq b \), the profit is simply \( n \times a \). Otherwise, it calculates a modified profit using the formula \( n \times a + (b - a) \times (k + 1) - k \times (k + 1) / 2 \), where \( k = \min(n - 1, b - a) \). The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, where \( t \) is a positive integer between 1 and \( 10^4 \) (inclusive). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated profit for each case.**
