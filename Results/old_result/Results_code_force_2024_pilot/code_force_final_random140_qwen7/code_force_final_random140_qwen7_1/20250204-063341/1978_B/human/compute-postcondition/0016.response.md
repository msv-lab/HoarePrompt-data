`t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`. The values of `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, and `profit` is calculated based on the conditions given.**
