Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    n = x[0]
    a = x[1]
    b = x[2]
    profit = n * a
    if a >= b:
        print(profit)
    else:
        k = b - a
        k = min(n - 1, k)
        profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
        print(int(profit))
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, and `profit` is calculated based on the conditions given.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `b` is now equal to the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a` if `a >= b`. Otherwise, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `x`, `a` is the first element of `x`, `b` is the original third element of `x` which is now reassigned to `x[2]`, `profit` is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` where `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and the original `k` which is `b - a` if `a < b`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
