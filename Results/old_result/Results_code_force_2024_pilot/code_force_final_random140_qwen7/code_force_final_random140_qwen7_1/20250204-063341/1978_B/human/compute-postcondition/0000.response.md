Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this code snippet, so they retain their unspecified positive integer values within the given range.
