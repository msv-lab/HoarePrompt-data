Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2`, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`, and `a` is less than `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `profit` by adding `(b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` to the current value of `profit`. Here, `k` is defined as `min(n - 1, b - a)`. Since `a` is less than `b`, `k` will be `min(n - 1, b - a)`. The updated `profit` is calculated using the new value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
