Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `x` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `x`. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are then assigned the first, second, and third elements of this list, respectively. The initial condition that `t` must be non-zero remains unchanged.
