Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `a` is the second element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is `n * a`, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`, and `a` is less than `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` to be the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`. Since `a` is less than `b`, `b - a` is a positive value. The value of `n` is 1 more than `k` because `k = min(n - 1, b - a)` and `b - a` is positive. Therefore, `k` is set to `b - a` if `b - a` is less than `n - 1`, otherwise `k` is set to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
