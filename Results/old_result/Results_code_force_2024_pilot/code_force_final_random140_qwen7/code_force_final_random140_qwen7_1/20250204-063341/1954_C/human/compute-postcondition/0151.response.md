Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `kq1` concatenated with the integer at index `i` of list `a`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together.**

This means that `kq1` has been updated by concatenating its current string value with the integer at index `i` from list `a`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `kq2` remain unchanged, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
