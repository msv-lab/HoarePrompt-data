The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`kq1` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`, followed by `a[i]` again; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + a[i]`; `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; `i` is `i + 1`.**
