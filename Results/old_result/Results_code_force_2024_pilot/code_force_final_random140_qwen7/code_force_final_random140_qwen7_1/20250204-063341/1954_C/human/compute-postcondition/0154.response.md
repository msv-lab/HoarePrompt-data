Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `x` or `y` (depending on the value of `vt`), and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together.**

This output state reflects that the values of `a` and `b` remain as lists of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is now the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is now the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` are updated according to their definitions, with `kq1` containing the string representation of either `x` or `y` based on the value of `vt`, and `kq2` containing the concatenated string representations of both `x` and `y`.
