Output State: **`kq1` is now the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and for all indices `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**

In more detail, the variable `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to it. Since `kq1` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `kq1` will contain the string value of `y`. The values of `x`, `y`, and the condition that for all indices `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` remain unchanged.
