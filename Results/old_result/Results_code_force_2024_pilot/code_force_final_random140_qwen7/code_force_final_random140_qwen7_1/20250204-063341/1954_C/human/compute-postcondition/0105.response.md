Postcondition: `i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. Depending on the value of `vt`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y` concatenated with either the string representation of `x` or `y`. `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x` and the string representation of `y` again. If `vt` is 1, `kq1` is updated to include the string representation of `x` at the end.
