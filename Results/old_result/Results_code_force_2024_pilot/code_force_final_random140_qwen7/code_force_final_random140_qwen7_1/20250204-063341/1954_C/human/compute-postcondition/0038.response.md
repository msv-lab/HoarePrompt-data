Postcondition: `kq1` is either the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`, followed by `a[i]`, or the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is updated to either `kq2 + a[i]` or `kq2 + b[i]` depending on which one is chosen. `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; for all indices `i+1`, `a[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i+1]`.
