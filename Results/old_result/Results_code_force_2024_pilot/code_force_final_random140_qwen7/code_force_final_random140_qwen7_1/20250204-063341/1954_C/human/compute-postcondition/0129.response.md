Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the `i`-th element of `a` is not equal to the `i`-th element of `b`; `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`, `kq2` is a string containing the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `y`.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` concatenates the string representation of `y` to `kq2`. Since `kq2` was initially an empty string (or potentially had some value before), after executing this line, `kq2` will now contain the string representation of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
