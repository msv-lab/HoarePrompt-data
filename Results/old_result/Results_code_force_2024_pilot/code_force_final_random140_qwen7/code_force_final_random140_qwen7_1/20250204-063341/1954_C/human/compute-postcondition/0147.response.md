Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the `(i)`-th element of `a` is either equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`, in which case the loop continues with the next iteration, or not equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`; if they are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`; `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of either `x` or `y` (depending on the value of `vt`), and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together; if `vt` is 1, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to its previous value, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to itself; if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` concatenated to its previous value, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to the existing value of `kq2`.
