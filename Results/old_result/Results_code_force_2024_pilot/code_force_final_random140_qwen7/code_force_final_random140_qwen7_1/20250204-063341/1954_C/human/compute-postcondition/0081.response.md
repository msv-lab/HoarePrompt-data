Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `len(a)` is greater than 0
   - `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`
   - `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`
   - `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`
   - `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`
   - `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`
   - `kq1` is equal to `a[0] + kq1`
   - `kq2` is `kq2 + a[1]` if `a[i]` equals `b[i]` (with `i` being 1)

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(a)):
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The condition `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` must still hold true for the loop to continue.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are derived from `a[0]` and `b[0]` and do not change within the loop.
   - The strings `kq1` and `kq2` are constructed based on the initial values of `a[0]` and `b[0]` and do not change within the loop.

4. **New States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 1
   - `len(a)` remains the same and is still greater than 0
   - `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) must not be equal to `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) for the loop to continue
   - `x` and `y` remain the same as they were derived from `a[0]` and `b[0]`
   - `kq1` and `kq2` remain the same as they were constructed from `a[0]` and `b[0]`

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`**
