Functionality: **The function processes two input strings `a` and `b` of equal length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9. For each pair of characters at the same index in `a` and `b`, if they are the same, the character is appended to both output strings `kq1` and `kq2`. If they differ, the smaller digit is appended first in `kq1` and the larger digit is appended first in `kq2`. After processing all characters, the function prints `kq1` and `kq2`.**
