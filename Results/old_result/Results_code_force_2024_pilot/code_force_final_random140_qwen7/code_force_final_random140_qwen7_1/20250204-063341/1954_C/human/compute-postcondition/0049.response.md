Postcondition: **`kq1` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`, followed by `a[i]`, and then the string representation of `x` is appended again. If `vt` is 0, then `kq2` is updated to either `kq2 + a[i]` or `kq2 + b[i]` depending on which one is chosen, and `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated to either `kq2 + a[i]` or `kq2 + b[i]` depending on which one is chosen. `vt` is 1, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, for all indices `i+1`, `a[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i+1]`, `x` is now the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is now the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**
