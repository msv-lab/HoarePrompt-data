Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `a[i]`, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` appends the value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) to the end of the string `kq1`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. The value of `kq1` is updated by concatenating the current value of `kq1` with `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
