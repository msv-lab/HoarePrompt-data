Postcondition: `kq1` is either the string `x` or the concatenation of the string representations of `y` and `x`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is either an empty string or the concatenation of the string representations of `x` and `y`; `vt` is 1.
