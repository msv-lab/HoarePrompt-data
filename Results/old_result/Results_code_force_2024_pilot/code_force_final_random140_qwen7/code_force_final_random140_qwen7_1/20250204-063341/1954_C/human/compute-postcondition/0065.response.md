The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to. Since no loop context is provided, we assume the `continue` statement is outside any loop, meaning it does not affect any variables.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `kq2` is `kq2 + a[1]`
- `kq1` is equal to `a[0] + kq1`
- The current value of `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`

Since there is no loop or conditional statement affecting these variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[1]`, `kq1` is equal to `a[0] + kq1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.**
