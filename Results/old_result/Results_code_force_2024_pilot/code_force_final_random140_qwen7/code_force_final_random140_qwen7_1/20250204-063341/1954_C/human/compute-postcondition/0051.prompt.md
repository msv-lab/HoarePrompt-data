Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `kq1` is an empty string, `x` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `kq1` is either the string `x` or the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`; `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; for all indices `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `kq1` is either the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`, followed by `a[i]`, or the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is updated to either `kq2 + a[i]` or `kq2 + b[i]` depending on which one is chosen. `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; for all indices `i+1`, `a[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i+1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `kq1` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`, followed by `a[i]` and then the string representation of `x` again. `kq2` is updated to either `kq2 + a[i]` or `kq2 + b[i]` depending on which one is chosen. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. `vt` is 1, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, and for all indices `i+1`, `a[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i+1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
