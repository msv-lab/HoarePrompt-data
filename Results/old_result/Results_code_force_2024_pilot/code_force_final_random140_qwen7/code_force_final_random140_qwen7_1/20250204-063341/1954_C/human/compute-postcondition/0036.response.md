Postcondition: **`kq1` is the concatenation of its original value and either the string representation of `x` or `y`. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of the other variable (`y` or `x`). `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; for all indices `i+1`, `a[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i+1]` and `x` is now the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is now the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**
