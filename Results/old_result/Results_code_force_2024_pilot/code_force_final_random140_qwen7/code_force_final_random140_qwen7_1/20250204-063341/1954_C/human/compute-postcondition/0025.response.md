Postcondition: `kq1` is either the string `x` or the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`; `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; for all indices `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
