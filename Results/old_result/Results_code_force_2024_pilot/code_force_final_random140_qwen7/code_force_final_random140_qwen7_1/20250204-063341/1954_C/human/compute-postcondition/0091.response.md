Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y` concatenated with either the string representation of `x` or `y` again, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x` and then either the string representation of `x` or `y` again.
