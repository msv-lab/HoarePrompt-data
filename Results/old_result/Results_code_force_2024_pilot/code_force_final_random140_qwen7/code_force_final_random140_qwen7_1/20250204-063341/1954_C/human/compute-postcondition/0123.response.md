Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `kq1` is `kq1 + a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement, the values of `a`, `b`, `kq1`, and `kq2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
