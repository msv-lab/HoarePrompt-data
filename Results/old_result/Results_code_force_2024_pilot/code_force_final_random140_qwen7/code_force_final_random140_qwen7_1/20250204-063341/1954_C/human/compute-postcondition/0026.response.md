Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `kq1` is either the string `x` or the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`.
- `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
- `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
- `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`.
- `vt` is 1.
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a non-empty string.
- `b` is an input string.
- For all indices `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `len(a) - 1`.
- Since the loop is iterating over the length of `a`, the loop can continue as long as `i < len(a)`.

### Adjusting the States
- `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `kq1`, `x`, `y`, `kq2`, `vt`, and `t` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

### New States at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
- `a` and `b` remain the same.
- `kq1`, `x`, `y`, `kq2`, `vt`, and `t` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was previously less than `len(a)` and the loop can continue as long as `i < len(a)`, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `a` and `b` remain the same.
- `kq1`, `x`, `y`, `kq2`, `vt`, and `t` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`kq1` is either the string `x` or the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`; `kq2` is the concatenation of its original value (an empty string) and the string representation of `y`; `vt` is 1; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is an input string; for all indices `i+1`, `a[i+1]` is not equal to `b[i+1]`**.
