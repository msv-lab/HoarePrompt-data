Output State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x` and the string representation of `y` again.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the end of `kq1`. Since `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `kq1` which initially contained the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, now becomes the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y` concatenated with the string representation of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
