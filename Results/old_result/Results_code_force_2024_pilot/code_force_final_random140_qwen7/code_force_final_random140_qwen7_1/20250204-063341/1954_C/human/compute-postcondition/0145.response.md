Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the `(i)`-th element of `a` is either equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`, in which case the loop continues with the next iteration, or not equal to the `(i)`-th element of `b`; if they are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`; `kq1` is a string that includes the string representation of `y` concatenated to its previous value; `kq2` is a string that includes the string representations of both `x` and `y` concatenated together.**

In this output state, the value of `kq1` has been updated by concatenating the string representation of `y` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
