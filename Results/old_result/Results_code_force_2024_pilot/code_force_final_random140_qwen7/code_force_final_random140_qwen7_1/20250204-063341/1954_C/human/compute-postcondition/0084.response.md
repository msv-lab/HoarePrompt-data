Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `a[i]`, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `a[i]`, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
