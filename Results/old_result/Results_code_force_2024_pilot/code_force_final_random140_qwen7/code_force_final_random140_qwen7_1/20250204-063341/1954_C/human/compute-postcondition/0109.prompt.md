Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `kq1` is '', `kq2` is '', `x` is the final minimum value encountered during the loop, `y` is the final maximum value encountered during the loop, `vt` is 0, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is updated to the input string, `b` is an input string, and `q` is `t`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`; `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`; `kq1` is equal to `a[0] + kq1`, and `kq2` is `kq2 + a[1]` if `a[i]` equals `b[i]` (with `i` being 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y` concatenated with the string representation of `x` or `y` depending on the value of `vt`, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x` and either the string representation of `y` or `x` again depending on the value of `vt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. Depending on the value of `vt`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y` concatenated with either the string representation of `x` or `y`. `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x` and the string representation of `y` again. If `vt` is 1, `kq2` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
