Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `kq1` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representations of the minimum values of corresponding characters in `a` and `b` for each iteration, followed by the maximum values of those same characters. `kq2` contains the concatenation of the maximum values of corresponding characters in `a` and `b` for each iteration. `x` is the final minimum value encountered during the loop, and `y` is the final maximum value encountered during the loop. `vt` is 1, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, and `i` equals the length of `a` (since the loop has completed all iterations).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to `b[len(a) - 1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[len(a) - 1])` and `int(b[len(a) - 1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[len(a) - 1])` and `int(b[len(a) - 1])`. Depending on the value of `vt`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` followed by the string representation of `y` concatenated with either the string representation of `x` or `y`. `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` followed by the string representation of `x` and the string representation of `y` again. If `vt` is 1, `kq2` is updated by adding `a[len(a) - 1]` to it.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `a` minus one, indicating the last iteration of the loop. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the minimum and maximum integer values from the last comparison made within the loop. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` will be constructed based on the outcomes of each comparison, with `kq1` starting with `x` followed by `y`, and `kq2` starting with `y` followed by `x`, with subsequent additions depending on the value of `vt` and the current comparison result.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements of `a` and `b` have been processed, and `i` is now equal to `len(a)`. The variable `kq1` contains a string where each differing pair of elements from `a` and `b` is represented by the larger number followed by the smaller number, and `kq2` contains a string where each differing pair is represented by the smaller number followed by the larger number. If two elements at the same index in `a` and `b` are the same, their string representation is appended to `kq1` and `kq2` without any change. The variable `vt` remains 1 after the loop completes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
