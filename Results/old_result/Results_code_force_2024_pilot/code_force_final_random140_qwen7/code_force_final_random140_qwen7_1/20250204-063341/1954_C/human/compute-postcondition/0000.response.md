Output State: **`x` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `t`. The initial states of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
