Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, meaning `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
- `len(a)` is greater than 0, so `a` is a non-empty list.
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to `b[len(a) - 1]`, indicating that the last elements of lists `a` and `b` are different.
- `x` is the minimum of `int(a[len(a) - 1])` and `int(b[len(a) - 1])`.
- `y` is the maximum of `int(a[len(a) - 1])` and `int(b[len(a) - 1])`.

The strings `kq1` and `kq2` are constructed based on these values and the value of `vt`:

- `kq1` starts with `x` followed by `y`, and then appends either `x` or `y` based on the value of `vt`.
- `kq2` starts with `y` followed by `x`, and then appends `y` to it.

However, since the value of `vt` is not specified, we cannot determine exactly what `kq2` will contain. But we know that `kq1` will always start with `x` followed by `y` and then append either `x` or `y` based on `vt`.

Given this information, the output of the `print(kq1)` statement will be a string that starts with the minimum value between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `b[len(a) - 1]` followed by the maximum value between them, and then appends either the minimum or the maximum value again, depending on the value of `vt`.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a string starting with the minimum value between a[len(a) - 1] and b[len(a) - 1], followed by the maximum value, and then appending either the minimum or the maximum value again based on the value of vt)**
