Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9), and `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

The code updates the value of `t` to an integer input, while the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `prices` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
