Output State: **`result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers; `prices` is a list of integers created by converting the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` retain their initial values from the input. The output state includes these unchanged variables and mentions that `result` is the return value of the function call.
