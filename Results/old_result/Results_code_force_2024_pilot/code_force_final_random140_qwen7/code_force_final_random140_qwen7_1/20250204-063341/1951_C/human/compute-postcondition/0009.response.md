Output State: **`prices` is updated to a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers, `t` must be greater than 0, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**.

Explanation: The code `prices = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `prices`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are already integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The function call `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` returns a value which is stored in `result`.
