Output State: **`prices` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`, `t` is 1**

Explanation: The code `prices = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in the variable `prices`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were already assigned values from the input split and converted to integers. The variable `t` remains as 1 since it was not affected by the code. The function call `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` returns a value which is stored in `result`, but the specific value of `result` is not known without knowing the implementation of `func_1`.
