Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but instead uses predefined variables t, n, m, k, and prices (a list of n integers). It returns a value based on these variables.**

- `t` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4].
- `n` is an integer within the range [1, 3⋅10^5].
- `m` is an integer within the range [1, 10^9].
- `k` is an integer within the range [1, min(n⋅m, 10^9)].
- `prices` is a list of `n` integers, each within the range [1, 10^9].

The function does not take any parameters explicitly passed to it but relies on these predefined variables to perform its operations and return a value.
