Output State: **The program returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, which is the sum of the costs calculated for each day until `k` tickets were purchased.**

This means the program calculates the total cost by summing up the cost of buying tickets each day until the total number of tickets (`k`) has been reached. The cost for each day is determined by the number of tickets purchased on that day, which is limited by `m` (the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), and the price per ticket on that day, as given in the `prices` list. The loop continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`.
