Output State: **`prices` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`, `t` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of `prices` as a list of integers from the input split remains unchanged, as does the `result` which is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`. The variable `t` remains as 1.
