To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `prices` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input and converted to integers.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

Given the initial state, the `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of the function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `prices`.

Therefore, the output will be the return value of the function `func_1` with the specified parameters.

Output: **result (the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
