Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads values for \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and a list of \( n \) integers representing prices. It then calls another function `func_1` with these values and prints the result returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.**
