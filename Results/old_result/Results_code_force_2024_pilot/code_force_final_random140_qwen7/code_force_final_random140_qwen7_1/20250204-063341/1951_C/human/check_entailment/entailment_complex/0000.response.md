Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets by iterating through the days and buying tickets on the cheapest days first, ensuring no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day.
   - It sorts the `prices` list, which ensures that the tickets are bought at the lowest possible cost first.
   - The logic within the loop correctly updates the total cost and the number of tickets bought, and it stops once `k` tickets have been bought.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles reading input and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these values and prints the result.
   - The overall structure and logic of `func_2` are correct and handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Given that both functions work together to process each test case correctly and calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
