You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9), and prices is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    """Handles input and output for multiple test cases."""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` is now the final value it was initialized to. For each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers, and `prices` is a list of integers created by converting the input split into integers. The variable `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for each iteration, and these results are printed after each call to `func_1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but instead uses predefined variables t, n, m, k, and prices (a list of n integers). It returns a value based on these variables.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
