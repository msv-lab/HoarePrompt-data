Postcondition: **`tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is updated to `2 * total_cost + cost`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[i]`, `total_cost` is updated by adding `cost` to its current value, and if `tickets_bought` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
