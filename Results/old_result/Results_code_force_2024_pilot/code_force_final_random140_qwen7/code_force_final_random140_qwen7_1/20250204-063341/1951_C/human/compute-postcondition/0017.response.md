Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` is now the final value it was initialized to. For each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers, and `prices` is a list of integers created by converting the input split into integers. The variable `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for each iteration, and these results are printed after each call to `func_1`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` will hold the total number of iterations, which is the final value it was set to initially. Each `result` from `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for every iteration is printed, reflecting the outcome of the function for the respective inputs.
