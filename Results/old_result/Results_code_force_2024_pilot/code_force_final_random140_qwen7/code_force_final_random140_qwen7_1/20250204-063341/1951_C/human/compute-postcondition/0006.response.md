Based on the initial state provided:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.
- `prices` is a list of integers created by converting the input split into integers.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of `func_1` with the given parameters.

Output: **result (the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
