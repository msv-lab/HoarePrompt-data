Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets within `n` days, given the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day (`m`) and the price per ticket for each day (`prices`).
   - It sorts the `prices` list, which is unnecessary because the algorithm doesn't rely on the order of prices.
   - It iterates through each day, determining how many tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), calculating the cost, updating the total cost, and reducing the remaining tickets to buy.
   - The sorting step is redundant because the algorithm doesn't need the sorted list to work correctly. The logic inside the loop handles the logic of buying tickets and adjusting future prices correctly without needing to sort the list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of prices for each day.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

### Issues Identified

1. **Sorting the Prices List**:
   - The `func_1` function sorts the `prices` list, which is unnecessary. Sorting is not required for the logic to work correctly. The algorithm can work directly with the unsorted list of prices.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm in `func_1` correctly handles the logic of buying tickets and adjusting future prices based on the number of tickets bought on each day. It ensures that the minimum cost is achieved by always buying the cheapest available tickets first.

### Conclusion

The core logic of the program is correct. The only issue is the unnecessary sorting of the `prices` list, which does not affect the correctness but is inefficient. However, since the problem statement guarantees valid inputs and the logic is sound, the program will produce the correct results despite this inefficiency.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
