Output State: All tickets have been bought, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs calculated based on the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets to be bought each day, `n` is the number of sale days, `m` is the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is the total number of tickets to buy, `i` is the last index of the `prices` list (i.e., `n-1`), and `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, ensuring that exactly `k` tickets have been purchased, with the total cost being the sum of the minimum possible tickets bought each day multiplied by their respective prices until the required number of tickets (`k`) is reached.
