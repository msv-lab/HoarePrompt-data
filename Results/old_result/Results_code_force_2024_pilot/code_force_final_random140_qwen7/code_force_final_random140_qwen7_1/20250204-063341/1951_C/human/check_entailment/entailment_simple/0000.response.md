### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets across `n` days, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day and the price increase mechanism.
   - It sorts the `prices` list to ensure that cheaper tickets are bought first, which is a valid strategy to minimize the total cost.
   - The logic inside the loop ensures that the tickets are bought in a way that minimizes the cost by purchasing the maximum allowed tickets each day until `k` tickets are bought.
   - The function correctly handles the condition where the total tickets bought reach `k`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `prices` list for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters for each test case and prints the result.
   - The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case independently.

3. **Overall Program Structure**:
   - The program structure is correct and follows the problem statement.
   - The main function calls `func_2`, which in turn calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input and output handling is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.
