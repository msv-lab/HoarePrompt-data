Output State: **`tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is updated to `2 * total_cost + cost`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[i]`, `total_cost` is updated by adding `cost` to its current value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. It does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or conditional block has been exited. All the other variables retain their values as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
