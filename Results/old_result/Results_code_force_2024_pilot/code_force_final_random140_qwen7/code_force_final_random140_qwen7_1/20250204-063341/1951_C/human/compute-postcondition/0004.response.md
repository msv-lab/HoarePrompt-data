Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers; `prices` is a list of integers created by converting the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. This creates a new list called `prices` containing these integer values. The original variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is defined as being integers assigned values from the input split and converted to integers.
