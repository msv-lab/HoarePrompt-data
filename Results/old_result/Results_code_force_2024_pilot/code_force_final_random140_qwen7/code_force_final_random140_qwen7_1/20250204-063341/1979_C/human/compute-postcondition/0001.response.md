Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]`. The variables involved here are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `num`**: 
   - The loop starts iterating from `numbers[1]`, meaning `num` will take the value of `numbers[1]` in the first iteration.
   - Therefore, `num` must be initialized to `numbers[1]` for the loop to start.

3. **Determine the State of `numbers`**:
   - The list `numbers` must contain at least two elements for the loop to execute (since it starts from `numbers[1]`).
   - Initially, `hcf` is set to `numbers[0]`, but this does not affect the loop starting condition directly.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `num` will be `numbers[1]` in the first iteration, we need to ensure that `numbers` has at least two elements.
   - We don't need to adjust `hcf` as it is already set to `numbers[0]` and does not affect the loop's execution.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `numbers` must have at least two elements.
- `num` must be initialized to `numbers[1]`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`hcf` is equal to `numbers[0]`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` is `numbers[1]`**.
