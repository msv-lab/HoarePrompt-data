Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `hcf` is equal to `gcd(hcf, num)`
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `numbers` must have at least 2 elements
- `num` is `numbers[2]`

### Loop Statement
```
for num in numbers[1:]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the `numbers` list.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `num`: This variable is used to iterate through the elements of `numbers[1:]`.
   - `numbers`: This list is used as the source for the loop iterations.

### Adjusting the States
- **`num`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was set to `numbers[2]`. For the next iteration, `num` will be set to the next element in the list, which is `numbers[3]`.
- **`numbers`**: The list itself does not change within the loop; it remains the same as long as the loop continues.
- **`hcf`**: The value of `hcf` is updated in each iteration but is not directly controlled by the loop head. It is modified inside the loop body but not adjusted here.
- **`t`**: The value of `t` is not changed by the loop and remains the same.

### New State
Given the above analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `num` and `numbers`.

- `num` will be `numbers[3]`.
- `numbers` must still have at least 2 elements, but since the loop is iterating through the list, we assume it still meets this condition.

### Final Answer
State: **`hcf` is equal to `gcd(hcf, numbers[3])`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` is `numbers[3]`**
