### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to evaluate its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the GCD of a list of integers.
   - It correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of multiple numbers.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`, which is essentially the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers.
   - It then calculates the bets by dividing `m` by each `k_i`.
   - It uses `func_1` to find the GCD of the calculated bets.
   - It divides each bet by the GCD to simplify the bets.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the simplified bets is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the simplified bets.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not ensure the sum of the bets is strictly less than the product of the LCM and the smallest \(k_i\). Let's verify this with the provided test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  5
  5 5 5 5 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  -1
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  8 8 8 8 8
  ```

- Explanation:
  - The LCM of `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` is `5`.
  - The bets are calculated as `[5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - The sum of the bets is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`, which is not strictly less than `5 * 5 = 25`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  7 9 3 17 9 13
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
  ```

- Explanation:
  - The LCM of `[7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]` is `29253`.
  - The bets are calculated as `[29253/7, 29253/9, 29253/3, 29253/17, 29253/9, 29253/13] = [4179, 3251, 9751, 1727, 3251, 2251]`.
  - The sum of the bets is `4179 + 3251 + 9751 + 1727 + 3251 + 2251 = 24710`, which is strictly less than `29253 * 3 = 87759`.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  6 3 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  -1
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  8 6 3
  ```

- Explanation:
  - The LCM of `[6, 3, 2]` is `6`.
  - The bets are calculated as `[6/6, 6/3, 6/2] = [1, 2, 3]`.
  - The sum of the bets is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is not strictly less than `6 * 2 = 12`.

From the analysis, we see that the program does not correctly handle the condition where the sum of the bets should be strictly less than the product of the LCM and the smallest \(k_i\). The program sometimes outputs invalid solutions, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is not correct for all potential cases as it fails to ensure the sum of the bets is strictly less than the required value.
