Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for num in numbers[1:]`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `num`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `hcf` is equal to `gcd(hcf, num)`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `numbers` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `num` is `numbers[1]`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop starts with `num` being the second element of the `numbers` list (`numbers[1]`).
   - In each iteration, `num` is updated to the next element in the list (`numbers[2]`, `numbers[3]`, etc.).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is updated to the next element in the list, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be `numbers[2]` if it is the first iteration after the initial state, or `numbers[i+1]` for subsequent iterations.
   - `hcf` will be updated to `gcd(hcf, num)` in each iteration.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `numbers` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `hcf` is equal to `gcd(hcf, num)`.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `numbers` must have at least 2 elements.
- `num` is `numbers[1]`.

For the next iteration, `num` will be `numbers[2]` (assuming it is the first iteration after the initial state).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`hcf` is equal to `gcd(hcf, numbers[2])`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` is `numbers[2]`**.
