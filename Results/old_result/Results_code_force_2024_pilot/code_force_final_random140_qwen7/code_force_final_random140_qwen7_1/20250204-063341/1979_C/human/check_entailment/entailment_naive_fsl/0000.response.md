Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_i\) and then divides this LCM by each \(k_i\) to get the bets. However, the bets should be chosen such that their sum is strictly less than the product of the LCM and the smallest \(k_i\). 

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
3
5
5 5 5 5 5
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
3
6 3 2
```

- Expected Output:
```
-1
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
-1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
8 8 8 8 8 
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
8 6 3 
```

For the first and third test cases, the program incorrectly outputs positive values instead of `-1` because the sum of the bets is not strictly less than the product of the LCM and the smallest \(k_i\). For the second test case, the program seems to provide a valid solution, but it does not handle the condition strictly less than correctly, which could lead to incorrect results for other inputs. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
