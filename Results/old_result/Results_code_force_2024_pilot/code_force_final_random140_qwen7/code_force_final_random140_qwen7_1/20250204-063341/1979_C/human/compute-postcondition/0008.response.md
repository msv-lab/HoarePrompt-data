Output State: `hcf` is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in `numbers`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` is the last element processed in the loop, which is `numbers[-1]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `hcf` will hold the GCD of all the numbers in the list `numbers`.
