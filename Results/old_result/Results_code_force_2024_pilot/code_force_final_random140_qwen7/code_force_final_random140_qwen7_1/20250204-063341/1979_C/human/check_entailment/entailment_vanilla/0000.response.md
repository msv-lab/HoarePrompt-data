Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\), and the total bet should be less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Key Insight**: To ensure the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome, we need to find a common factor that can scale the bets appropriately. The idea is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, but since we need the greatest common divisor (GCD) to scale down, we use `func_1` which calculates the GCD of the multipliers.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`).
   - It then divides this product by each multiplier to get potential bet values (`c`).
   - It uses `func_1` to find the GCD of these bet values.
   - It scales down the bet values by dividing each by the GCD.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the scaled-down bet values is less than the product `m`. If so, it prints the scaled-down bet values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring the sum of the bets is less than the product of multipliers.
   - The GCD calculation ensures that the bets are scaled down to the smallest possible values while maintaining the required condition.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the program aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The use of GCD ensures that the bets are scaled down appropriately.
   - The check at the end ensures that the sum of bets is strictly less than the product of multipliers.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
