Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k_i`. However, the problem requires that the total amount of coins bet should be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Therefore, `m` should be the minimum value among the multipliers `k_i`, not their product.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`. However, it is not clear why GCD is needed here. The GCD is not necessary for solving the problem as stated.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Checking and Printing the Solution:**
   - The logic for checking if the sum of bets is less than the required amount is flawed. It should compare the sum of bets with the minimum `k_i` directly, not the product `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    min_k = min(k)
    
    # Calculate the maximum possible bet for each outcome
    c = [min_k - 1] * n
    
    if sum(c) >= min_k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')
```

This corrected version ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
