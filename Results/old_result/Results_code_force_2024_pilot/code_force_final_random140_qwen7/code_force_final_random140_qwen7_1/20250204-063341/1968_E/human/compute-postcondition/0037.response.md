Output State: The loop will execute until `i` reaches `n + 2`, and the final value of `i` will be `n + 2`. This means that after all iterations, `i` will be `n + 2`, where `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` can be any integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive.
