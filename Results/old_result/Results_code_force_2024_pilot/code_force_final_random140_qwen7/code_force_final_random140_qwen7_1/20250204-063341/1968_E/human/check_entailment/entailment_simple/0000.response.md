Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. However, the program always prints the same fixed coordinates regardless of the value of \(n\). Specifically, it prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) initially, and then for the remaining coordinates, it prints \((i, i)\) starting from \(i = 3\) up to \(i = n + 2\). This approach does not guarantee that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances will be achieved.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the example for \(n = 3\):

- The program would print: 
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  ```

- The Manhattan distances calculated would be:
  - Distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
  - Distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
  - Distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
  - Distance between \((3, 3)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(|3-4| + |3-4| = 2\)

  Therefore, the set of distances \(\mathcal{H}\) would be \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) should include the configuration:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

This configuration yields the set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a larger size (4) compared to the 6 distances obtained by the provided program.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
