Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The for loop is defined as: `for i in range(3, n + 2):`
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop starts from `3` and goes up to but does not include `n + 2`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 2`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Identify the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume the state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows (since it's not explicitly provided, we'll use a hypothetical example):
     - `i` is currently some value, say `k`.
     - `n` is some value, say `m`.

4. **Calculate the New Value of `i`:**
   - If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Condition is Met:**
   - For the loop to continue, `k + 1` must be less than `m + 2`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k = 4` and `n` is `m = 6`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1 = 5`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `5` must be less than `6 + 2 = 8`.

### Final State:
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `5` and `n` must still be `6` or greater.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6**
