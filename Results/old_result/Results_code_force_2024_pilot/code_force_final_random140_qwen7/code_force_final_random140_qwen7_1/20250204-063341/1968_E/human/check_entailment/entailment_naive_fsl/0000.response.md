Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, for \( n > 2 \), the program only prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) initially, and then for the remaining cells, it prints coordinates in the form \((i, i)\). However, this approach does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, consider \( n = 3 \):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  3 4
  ```
- The Manhattan distances calculated are:
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((3, 4)\): \(|1-3| + |1-4| = 5\)
  - Between \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
  - Between \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 4)\): \(|1-3| + |2-4| = 4\)
  - Between \((3, 3)\) and \((3, 4)\): \(|3-3| + |3-4| = 1\)

- The set of distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 3, 4, 5\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4.

However, the optimal solution for \( n = 3 \) should be:
- Output:
  ```
  2 1
  2 3
  3 1
  ```
- The Manhattan distances calculated are:
  - Between \((2, 1)\) and \((2, 3)\): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Between \((2, 1)\) and \((3, 1)\): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
  - Between \((2, 3)\) and \((3, 1)\): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)

- The set of distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3, which is smaller than the previous output but still suboptimal compared to the theoretical maximum.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) and hence is incorrect.
