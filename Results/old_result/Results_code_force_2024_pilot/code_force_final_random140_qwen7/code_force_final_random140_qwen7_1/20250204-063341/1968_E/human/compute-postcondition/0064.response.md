Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i in range(1, n - 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `1 <= i < n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is currently 2.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration (as implied by the range), the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `1 <= i < n - 1` must still hold true. Given that `i` will be 3, the condition becomes `1 <= 3 < n - 1` or `3 < n - 1` which simplifies to `n > 4`.

6. **Adjust the State**: The state needs to reflect the updated values of `i` and the condition for `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 3**
