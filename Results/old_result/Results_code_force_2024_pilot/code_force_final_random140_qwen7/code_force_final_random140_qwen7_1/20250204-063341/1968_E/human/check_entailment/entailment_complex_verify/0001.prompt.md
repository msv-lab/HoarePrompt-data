You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute until `i` reaches `n + 2`, and the final value of `i` will be `n + 2`. This means that after all iterations, `i` will be `n + 2`, where `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and `n` can be any integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it prints a sequence of pairs of integers. Specifically, it prints (1, 1), (1, 2), followed by pairs (i, i) for `i` ranging from 3 to `n + 1`. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but outputs the generated sequence of pairs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - The program should output \( n \) points that achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - Then, it iterates from 3 to \( n + 2 \) and prints coordinates of the form \((i, i)\).

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of \( n \)**:
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - The output will be:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       7 7
       ```
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). This is correct.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly outputs the required coordinates for different values of \( n \) to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.
