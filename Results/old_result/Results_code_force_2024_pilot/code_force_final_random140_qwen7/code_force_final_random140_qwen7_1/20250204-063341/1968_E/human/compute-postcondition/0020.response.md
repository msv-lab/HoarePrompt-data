Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `n + 2`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3

Given these conditions, let's determine the value of `i`.

Since `n` is at least 3, the smallest possible value for `i` would be:

\[ i = n + 2 \geq 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Therefore, `i` is at least 5. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified beyond it being greater than or equal to 3, `i` could be any integer greater than or equal to 5.

The `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` twice.

Output: **5 5 (where i is the value of n + 2, and since n ≥ 3, i ≥ 5)**
