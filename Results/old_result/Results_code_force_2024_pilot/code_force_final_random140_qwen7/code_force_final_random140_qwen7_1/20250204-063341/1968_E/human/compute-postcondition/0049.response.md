Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 4 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 4

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be at least 4.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the range 4 to `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` starts from 4 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `n`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 4.
   - `j` will be `n` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is `n`**
