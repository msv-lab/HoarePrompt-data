The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('2 4')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'2 4'`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` are not used in this particular print statement.

Output: **2 4**
