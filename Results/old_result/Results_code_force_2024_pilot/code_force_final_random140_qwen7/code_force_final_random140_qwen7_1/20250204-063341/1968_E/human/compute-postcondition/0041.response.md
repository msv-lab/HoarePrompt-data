Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `j` is defined based on the value of `n`:
     - If `n` equals 3, `j` remains undefined.
     - Otherwise, `j` is either `n + 1` (if `n` is at least 6) or `n + 3` (if `n` is at least 4 but not 6).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state of `j`**:
   - Since `i` is now 2, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.
   - The value of `j` does not change with each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the value of `j` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `j` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `j` is defined based on the value of `n` as described above.**
