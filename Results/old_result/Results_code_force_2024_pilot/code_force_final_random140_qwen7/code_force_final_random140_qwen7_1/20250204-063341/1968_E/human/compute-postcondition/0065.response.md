Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 4, but the value of `n` itself is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 3.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This will print the value of `i`, which is 3, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **3 **
