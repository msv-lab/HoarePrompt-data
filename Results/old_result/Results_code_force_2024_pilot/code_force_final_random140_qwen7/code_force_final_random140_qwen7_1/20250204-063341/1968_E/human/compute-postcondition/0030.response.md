Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` is an input integer that is greater than `n + 3`. This condition is contradictory because no integer can be greater than itself plus three. However, since the problem asks us to determine what will be printed based on the precondition and we have a clear value for `i`, we should focus on the values we know.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Given that `i` is 4, the print statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **4 4**
