Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized within the loop as `j = 4`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `4 <= n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is initialized inside the loop, its value does not need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 4 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be at least 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4**
