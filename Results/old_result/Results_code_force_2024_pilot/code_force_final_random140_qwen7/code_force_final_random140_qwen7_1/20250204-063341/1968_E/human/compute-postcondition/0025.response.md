Output: **1, 1**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `i` is defined as `n + 3`, where `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3`. However, this information about `n` being greater than `n + 3` is contradictory and not feasible in standard arithmetic. Nonetheless, the `print` statement simply outputs the numbers `1` and `1` without referencing `i`. Therefore, the output is directly `1, 1`.
