Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The annotated program only prints a fixed pattern of points: (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i, i) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n + 1\).
3. Let's analyze the output for different values of \(n\):
   - For \(n = 2\): The output is (1, 1), (1, 2). The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1\}\), so \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.
   - For \(n = 3\): The output is (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3). The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), so \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3.
   - For \(n = 4\): The output is (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4). The Manhattan distances include \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), so \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4.
   - For \(n = 5\): The output is (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5). The Manhattan distances include \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), so \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5.
   - For \(n = 6\): The output is (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6). The Manhattan distances include \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), so \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 6.

Given these observations, the program correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
