Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 3 to `n + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3`. This seems contradictory because `n` cannot be greater than `n + 3`. Let's assume this was meant to say `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3` (which implies `n` is not defined correctly here). For the sake of the exercise, let's assume `n` is some value greater than 7 (since `n + 3` would be greater than 10, and `n` itself would be greater than 7).

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, the loop will continue if `i < n + 2`.
   - Given `i` is 4, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 2`. Therefore, `n + 2` must be greater than 4, which means `n` must be greater than 2. However, since `n` is defined as being greater than `n + 3`, `n` must be greater than 7.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 5.
   - `n` must remain greater than 7 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is an input integer greater than 8**
