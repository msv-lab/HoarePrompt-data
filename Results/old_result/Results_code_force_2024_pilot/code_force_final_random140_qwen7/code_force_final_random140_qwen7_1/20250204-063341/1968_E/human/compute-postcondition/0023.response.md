Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `i` will have the value of `n + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

4. **Current State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n + 3`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `n + 3` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3` for the loop to continue.

6. **Final State**:
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
     - `i` is `n + 3`.
     - `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3`**
