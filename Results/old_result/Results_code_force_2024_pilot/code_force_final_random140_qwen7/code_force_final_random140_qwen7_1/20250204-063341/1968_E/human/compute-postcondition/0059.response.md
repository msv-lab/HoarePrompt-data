Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, i is equal to t - 1, and n is an input integer. If n equals 3, j remains undefined. Otherwise, j is set to n + 1 if n is at least 6, or n + 3 if n is between 4 and 5 (inclusive).**

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `t` remains as the initial input integer within the given range. The loop variable `i` will be `t - 1` after all iterations since it increments from 0 to `t - 1`. The variable `n` retains its last input value, and `j` is defined based on the value of `n` as described above.
