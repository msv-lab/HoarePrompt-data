Output State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is `n`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `n`, because the loop increments `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive) by printing each value of `j` in the process. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
