Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 5.
- `i` is `n-2`.

The `print` statement simply prints a space character.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we know that `i` will be two less than `n`, but this specific value of `i` is not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is a single space character.

Output: ** **
