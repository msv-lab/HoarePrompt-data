Output State: The loop will execute `n - 3` times, printing pairs of numbers where the first number in each pair starts from 3 and increments by 1 up to `n + 1`, and the second number in each pair is always 1. After all iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n + 2`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n + 1`, printing `(i, 1)` and then `(i, 2)` for each value of `i`. After the loop completes, the final value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and it will have printed all values from 3 to `n + 1` for both `(i, 1)` and `(i, 2)`.
