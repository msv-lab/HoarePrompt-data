Output: **1, 1**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is set to `n`. The print statement `print(1, 1)` simply outputs the numbers 1 and 1. Since no specific value for `n` is provided, we do not need to substitute any specific value for `i` or `n` in the output.
