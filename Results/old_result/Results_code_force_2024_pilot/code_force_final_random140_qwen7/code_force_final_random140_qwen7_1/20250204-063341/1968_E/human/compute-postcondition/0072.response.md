Output State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0, `n` will be greater than 5, and `i` will be `n-2`.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `t` by 1 each iteration until `t` reaches 0. Since `n` must be greater than 5 after 3 iterations (as given in the third output state), and considering the loop structure, `n` will continue to decrease by 1 with each iteration through the for loop until it no longer meets the condition `n > 3`. The variable `i` will take the value of `n-2` after the last iteration where `n` is greater than 5, as it increments from 1 up to `n-2` in the for loop.
