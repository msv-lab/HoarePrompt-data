Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is defined as `n + 1` and `n` is at least 3, the smallest possible value for `i` is `3 + 1 = 4`.

4. **Print Statement Execution**:
   - The print statement will output the value of `i` twice, separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **4 4**
