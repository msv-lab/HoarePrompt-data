Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, int(input())):`. The key variables here are `i` and the input value that determines the range.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop prints each value of `i` starting from 0 up to `int(input()) - 1`. The final value of `i` will be `int(input()) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: The loop will execute `n - 3` times, where `n` is a value such that `n >= 6`. This means that the current value of `i` is `n - 1` (since it starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 1`).

4. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `i` should be `n` (the next value after `n - 1`). The input value (`int(input()`) remains the same as it is determined only once at the start of the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `n`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 6 still holds.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6**
