Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 4.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

However, there is no definition or initialization of the variable `j` in the provided initial state. Since `j` is not defined, it cannot be determined what value it holds. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific value for `j`.

Output: **str(j) + ' ' + str(j) (where j is an undefined variable)**
