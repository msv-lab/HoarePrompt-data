Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial state of `n` as "an input integer" is updated to reflect that `n` has been assigned the value of the input integer.
