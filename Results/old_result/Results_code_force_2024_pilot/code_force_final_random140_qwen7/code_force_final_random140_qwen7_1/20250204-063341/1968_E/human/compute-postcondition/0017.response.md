Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3

2. **Loop Head Analysis**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(3, n + 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`.

4. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3

5. **Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n + 2`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will execute one more time if `n` remains the same and `i` becomes `n + 1`.

6. **Adjusting States**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration.

7. **Updated State**: After the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1` and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

Thus, the updated state for the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
