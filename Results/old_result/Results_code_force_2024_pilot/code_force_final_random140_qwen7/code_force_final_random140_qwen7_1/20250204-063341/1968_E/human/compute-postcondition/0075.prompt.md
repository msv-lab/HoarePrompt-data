You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        print(n, end=' ')
        
        print(n)
        
        print(n, end=' ')
        
        print(n - 1)
        
        if n == 3:
            print(2, end=' ')
            print(1)
        else:
            for i in range(1, n - 1):
                print(i, end=' ')
                print(i)
        
        print(' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and -2 (inclusive), which effectively means `t` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 5 with `i` being `n-2`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed three times as specified, `t` would have been decremented by 3 each time, resulting in `t` becoming 0. The variable `n` must be greater than 5 because it needs to go through the for-loop twice (from 1 to `n-2`) after the if-else block has run once, ensuring `n > 3` and thus `n > 5` after three iterations. The variable `i` is set to `n-2` at the end of the last iteration's for-loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 50) and an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^3). For each test case, it performs some operation based on the values of t and n, but the specific operation is not detailed here. The function returns a result for each test case, which could be a value, a string, or a collection of values, depending on the operation performed.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
