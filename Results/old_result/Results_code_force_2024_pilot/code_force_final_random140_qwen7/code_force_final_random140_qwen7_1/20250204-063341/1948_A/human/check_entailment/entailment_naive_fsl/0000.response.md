Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as defined in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters. For example, consider the case when `n = 3`. The function generates a string like "AAAB", which has only 2 special characters (positions 2 and 3), not 3 as required. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
