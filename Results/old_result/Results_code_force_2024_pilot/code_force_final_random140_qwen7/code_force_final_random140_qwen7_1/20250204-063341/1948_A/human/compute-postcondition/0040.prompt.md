You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: The final value of `i` will be `n + 1`, `n` will be 0, `letter` is a string containing 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `res` will be a string consisting of the character at index `i % 26` in `letter` repeated `n // 2` times if `n` was initially even, or repeated `(n - 1) // 2` times followed by the same character once if `n` was initially odd.
        #
        #To explain further, the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. Each iteration either subtracts 2 from `n` and appends two of the current character to `res` (if `n` is 2 or more), or subtracts 1 from `n` and appends one character to `res` (if `n` is 1). This process repeats until `n` reaches 0. The variable `i` increments by 1 each time the loop runs. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to the original value of `n` plus 1, and `res` will be constructed based on how many times the loop appended characters to it, which depends on the initial value of `n`.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: ""
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is `n + 1`, `letter` is a string containing 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `res` is a string consisting of the character at index `i % 26` in `letter` repeated `(n // 2)` times if `n` was initially even, or repeated `((n - 1) // 2)` times followed by the same character once if `n` was initially odd.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value where n is within the range of 1 to 50 inclusive.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
