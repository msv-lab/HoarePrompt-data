Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, `i` is 2. If `n` is odd, `ans` is a string consisting of the first two characters of `s`, repeated `int(input())` times. If `n` is even, `ans` is a string containing "ss" repeated `n` times, `x` is `n` divided by 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1.
