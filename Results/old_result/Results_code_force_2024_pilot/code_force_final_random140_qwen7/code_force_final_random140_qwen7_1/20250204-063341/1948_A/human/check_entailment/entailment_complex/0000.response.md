Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a string with exactly `n` special characters where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. The solution provided uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` correctly handles the logic for generating a string with the required number of special characters:
   - If `n` is 1 or less, it prints "NO".
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it prints "YES" and constructs a string using characters from 'A' to 'Z' such that the string has exactly `n` special characters.
4. `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
5. The overall structure and logic of both functions align with the problem requirements and produce the correct output for the given examples.

Given the analysis, the program meets the problem description and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
