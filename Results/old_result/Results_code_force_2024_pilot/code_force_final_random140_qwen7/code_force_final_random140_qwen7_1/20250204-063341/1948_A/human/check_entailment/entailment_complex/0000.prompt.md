Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#Function 1:

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :

        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: The final value of `i` will be `n + 1`, `n` will be 0, `letter` is a string containing 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `res` will be a string consisting of the character at index `i % 26` in `letter` repeated `n // 2` times if `n` was initially even, or repeated `(n - 1) // 2` times followed by the same character once if `n` was initially odd.
        #
        #To explain further, the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. Each iteration either subtracts 2 from `n` and appends two of the current character to `res` (if `n` is 2 or more), or subtracts 1 from `n` and appends one character to `res` (if `n` is 1). This process repeats until `n` reaches 0. The variable `i` increments by 1 each time the loop runs. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to the original value of `n` plus 1, and `res` will be constructed based on how many times the loop appended characters to it, which depends on the initial value of `n`.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: ""
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is `n + 1`, `letter` is a string containing 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `res` is a string consisting of the character at index `i % 26` in `letter` repeated `(n // 2)` times if `n` was initially even, or repeated `((n - 1) // 2)` times followed by the same character once if `n` was initially odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string `res`. If the input `n` is 1 or less, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string `res` by repeating characters from 'A' to 'Z' based on the value of `n`. Specifically, if `n` is even, it repeats each character twice; if `n` is odd, it repeats each character twice except for the last character which is repeated once. After constructing `res`, it prints the string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language: The value of `t` must remain greater than 0 after all the iterations of the loop have finished. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and there are no operations within the loop that change the value of `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls the `func_1()` function. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` must remain greater than 0.
