Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignments or operations that affect `t` are provided), the precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information about the variables that we can confidently state is that `t` must still be greater than 0.
