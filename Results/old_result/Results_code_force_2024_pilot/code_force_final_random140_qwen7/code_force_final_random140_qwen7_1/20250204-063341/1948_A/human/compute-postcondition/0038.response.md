Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is `n + 1`, `letter` is a string containing 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `res` is a string consisting of the character at index `i % 26` in `letter` repeated `(n // 2)` times if `n` was initially even, or repeated `((n - 1) // 2)` times followed by the same character once if `n` was initially odd.**
