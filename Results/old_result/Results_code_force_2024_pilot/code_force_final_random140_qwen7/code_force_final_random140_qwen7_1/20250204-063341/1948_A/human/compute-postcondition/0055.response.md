Output State: **`ans` is "ssssss", `x` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends twice the character at index `x` in the string `s` to the end of the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 2, `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, and `s[2]` is 'C', the operation `s[2] * 2` results in 'CC'. Therefore, `ans` changes from "sss" to "ssssss". The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
