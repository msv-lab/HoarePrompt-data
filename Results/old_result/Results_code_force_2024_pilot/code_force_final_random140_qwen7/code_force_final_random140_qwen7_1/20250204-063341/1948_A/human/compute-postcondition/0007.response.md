Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.

Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop has completed all its iterations without `t` becoming less than or equal to 0, the final state of `t` must still satisfy the condition that it is greater than 0.
