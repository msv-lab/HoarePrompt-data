Output State: **`ans` is a string containing "ss" repeated `n` times, `x` is `n` divided by 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, `i` is 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will be a string where each character from `s` is repeated twice, and this process repeats for `n // 2` times. Therefore, if `n` is 6, `ans` will be "ssssss". The variable `x` will be equal to `n // 2` because it increments by 1 in each iteration. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
