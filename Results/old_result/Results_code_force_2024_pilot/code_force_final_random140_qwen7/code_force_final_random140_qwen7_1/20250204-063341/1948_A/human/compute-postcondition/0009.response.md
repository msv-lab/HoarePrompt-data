Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the provided code snippet, the function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The constraints mentioned (t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) suggest that these might be used internally within the function for some operations, but they are not passed as function arguments. Since there is no return statement or output specified, the function does not return anything.
