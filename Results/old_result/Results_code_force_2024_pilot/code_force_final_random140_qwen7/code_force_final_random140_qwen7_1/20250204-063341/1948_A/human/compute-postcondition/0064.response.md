Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer `n`. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string consisting of pairs of uppercase English alphabet characters (e.g., "ABCD...") and prints 'YES' followed by this string. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of uppercase English alphabets, `i` is `t-1`, and `ans` is a constructed string based on the even `n` values.**
