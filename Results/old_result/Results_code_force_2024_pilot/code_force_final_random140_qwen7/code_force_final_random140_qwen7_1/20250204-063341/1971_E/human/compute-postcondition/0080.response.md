Output State: **`ad` is [0, `a[i] - a[i - 1]`], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer minus the sum of all `a[s-1]` values encountered during the loop, `v` is an empty list, `m` is the cumulative sum of `b[s-1] + (bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))` for each iteration, `l` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `ql` is the final value after subtracting all `a[s-1]` values from the initial input integer, `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `a` must have at least two elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted by the user, `bd` is [0]**.

Explanation: The code `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. All other variables remain unchanged.
