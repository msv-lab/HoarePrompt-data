Output State: `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `v` contains the list of all values computed as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each iteration from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`.

In this final state, the variable `i` will be equal to `len(b) - 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`, and since `i` starts at `1`, it will end at `len(a) - 1`. The variable `v` will contain a list where each element is the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for every iteration of the loop, starting from `i = 1` up to `i = len(a) - 1`.
