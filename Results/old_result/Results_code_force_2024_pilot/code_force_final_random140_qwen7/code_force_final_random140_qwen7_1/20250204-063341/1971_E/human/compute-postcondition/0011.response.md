Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `len(a)` is greater than 1.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`, so `i` should be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.
4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.
5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Since `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `i` is now 4, the loop will not execute because `4` is not less than `len(a)` (which is at least 2).

Given this analysis, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, and since the loop will not execute again, `len(a)` does not need to be changed.

**Final State**:
State: **`ad` is a list containing three elements: 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`; `i` is 4; `len(a)` is greater than 1**
