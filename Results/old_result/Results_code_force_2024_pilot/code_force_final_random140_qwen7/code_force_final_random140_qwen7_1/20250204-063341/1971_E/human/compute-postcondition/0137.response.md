Postcondition: `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 3, and if `a[s]` equals `ql`, the condition is met as is; otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.
