Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `v` contains the value `[ad[i] / bd[i]]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Since `v` previously contained the value `ad[i] / bd[i]`, after executing the code, `v` will now contain a list with two elements: the original value and the new value `ad[i] / bd[i]`. The variable `i` is also incremented by 1 from its previous state.
