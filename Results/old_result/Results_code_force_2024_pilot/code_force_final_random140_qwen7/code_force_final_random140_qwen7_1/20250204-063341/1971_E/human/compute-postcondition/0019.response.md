Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(b)`. Since `i` is currently 3, the loop will execute again if `len(b)` is greater than 3.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the value of `i` to `i + 1` (which is 4) and ensure that `len(b)` is still less than the new value of `i` for the next iteration to occur. Given that `len(b)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue, we can keep `len(b)` as it is since it already satisfies this condition.

5. **Maintain other states**: The other states (`len(a) < len(b)`, `bd` being a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `bd` being `b[2] - b[1]` and now having an additional element `b[3] - b[2]`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 4, `len(a)` must be less than `len(b)`, `bd` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `bd` is `b[2] - b[1]`, and `bd` now has the additional element `b[3] - b[2]`**
