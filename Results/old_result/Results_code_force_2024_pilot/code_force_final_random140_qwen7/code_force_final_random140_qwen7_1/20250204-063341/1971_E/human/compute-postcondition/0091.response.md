Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1.
- `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i + 1] - b[i]` and also includes `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1.

### Adjusting the State
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- We need to check if `i + 1` is still within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1.
- If `i + 1` is still within this range, the loop will continue.

### New State
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `bd` will include the new element `b[i + 1] - b[i]`.

### Final State
Given that `i` is within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, and `bd` will include the new element `b[i + 1] - b[i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1, `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i + 1] - b[i]` and also includes `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.** 

However, since `i` is incremented by 1, the new state should reflect the updated value of `i`:

State: **`i` is within the range 2 to `len(b)` - 1, `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i + 1] - b[i]` and also includes `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.**
