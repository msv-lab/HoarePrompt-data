Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input parameters for the number of test cases, `n`, `k`, and `q` for each test case.
2. It initializes the positions `a` and times `b` for the known points.
3. It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and the corresponding speeds using the times in `b`.
4. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment of the journey where the queried point lies.
5. It then calculates the exact time taken to reach the queried point using the calculated speeds and distances.
6. The program handles edge cases where the queried point matches one of the known points exactly.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. The annotated program's explanation aligns with the expected behavior, and the code correctly processes each test case and query as specified.

Correctness: **True**
