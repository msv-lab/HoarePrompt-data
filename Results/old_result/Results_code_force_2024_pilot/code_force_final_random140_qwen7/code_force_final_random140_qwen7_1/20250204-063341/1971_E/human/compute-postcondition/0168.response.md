Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `len(b)`.

3. **Understand the range function**: The `range(1, len(a))` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `len(a)`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, the initial value of `i` (which is `len(b)`) must be within the range generated by `range(1, len(a))`. This means `len(b)` must be at least 1 and less than `len(a)`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `i` being within the specified range, we need to ensure that `len(b)` is at least 1 and less than `len(a)`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the lengths of the lists `b` and `a`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `len(b)`, `len(b)` must be at least 1 and less than `len(a)`**
