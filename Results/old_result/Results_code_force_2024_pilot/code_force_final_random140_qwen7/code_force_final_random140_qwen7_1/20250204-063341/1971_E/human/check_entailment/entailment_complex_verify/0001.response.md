### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and the arrays `a` and `b`. This part is correct.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and stores them in `ad` and `bd` respectively. This is done correctly.

3. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the speed between consecutive points in `a` using the formula `speed = distance / time`. This is also done correctly.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried point `ql` lies. This is generally correct, but there are some potential issues to consider:
     - The program assumes that the queried point `ql` is strictly less than `a[s]` when calculating the additional time. However, if `ql` is exactly between two points, the calculation might not be precise.
     - The program directly adds `bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` to `m`, which might not give the exact time due to integer division. This could lead to rounding errors.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the queried point exactly matches a known point. This is correctly handled by directly outputting the corresponding time.
   - However, the handling of the case where `ql` is exactly between two points needs to be more precise.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the results for each query in the required format. This is correct.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Binary Search and Distance Calculation**:
  - The use of `bisect_left` to find the segment where the queried point lies is correct.
  - The distances and speeds are calculated correctly.

- **Time Calculation**:
  - The calculation `m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` might introduce rounding errors because of integer division. For example, if `bd[s] = 2` and `ad[s] = 1.5`, then `bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` would be `2 * ql // 1.5`, which might not give the exact time.

- **Handling Between Points**:
  - The program does not handle the case where `ql` is exactly between two points precisely. It only considers the lower boundary of the segment, which might not give the correct time.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is mostly correct, but there is a potential issue with the time calculation due to integer division, which might lead to rounding errors. To ensure the program works correctly, we need to ensure that the time calculation is precise.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is almost correct but may introduce rounding errors due to integer division in the time calculation. To fix this, we can use floating-point arithmetic for the speed and distance calculations.
