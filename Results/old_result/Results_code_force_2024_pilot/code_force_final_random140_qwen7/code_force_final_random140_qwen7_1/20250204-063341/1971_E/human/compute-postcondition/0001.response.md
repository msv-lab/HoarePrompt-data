State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
3. The initial state mentions that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, but this assignment does not guarantee that `t` falls within the required range.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be explicitly adjusted to meet the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is within the specified range.
