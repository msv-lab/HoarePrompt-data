Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1; `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i + 1] - b[i]` and also includes `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Since `bd` already had an additional element equal to `b[i + 1] - b[i]`, now it includes both `b[i + 1] - b[i]` and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged within its original range.
