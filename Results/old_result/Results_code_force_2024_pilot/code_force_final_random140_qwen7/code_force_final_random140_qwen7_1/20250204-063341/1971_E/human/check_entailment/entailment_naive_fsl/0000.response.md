Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the queried point `d` falls exactly between two known points. Specifically, the program uses binary search to find the segment in which `d` lies but does not correctly calculate the time for such cases. For instance, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 3
  1 2 3
  1 2 4
  1
  1.5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program will not produce the correct output because it does not account for the exact midpoint calculation.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the exact time for points that fall between the known points using the speed calculated for that segment.
