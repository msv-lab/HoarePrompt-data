Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` up to the second last element of `a`, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer minus the sum of all `a[s-1]` values encountered during the loop, `v` is an empty list, `m` is the cumulative sum of `b[s-1] + (bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]))` for each iteration, `l` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `ql` is the final value after subtracting all `a[s-1]` values from the initial input integer, `s` is the final index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `a` contains the original input integer followed by all integers inputted by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted by the user, `bd` is [0].

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ad` will contain the differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the list `a`. The list `ad` will have one less element than `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a` plus one. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `q`, `v`, `m`, `l`, `ql`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `bd`) will retain their final states as described by the given output states after the first three iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is within the range 1 to len(b) - 1; `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is within the range 1 to `len(b)` - 1; `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i + 1] - b[i]` and also includes `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is within the range 2 to `len(b)` - 1; `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i + 1] - b[i]` and also includes `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, and `bd` now has an extra element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
