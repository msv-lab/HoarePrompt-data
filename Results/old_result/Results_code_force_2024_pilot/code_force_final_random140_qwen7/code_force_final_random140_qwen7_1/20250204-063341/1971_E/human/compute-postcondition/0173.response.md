Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `v` contains the value `[ad[k + 1] / bd[k + 1], ad[k + 1] / bd[k + 1]]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, the value being appended is `ad[k + 1] / bd[k + 1]`. Since this value was already in `v` before the append operation, now `v` contains both instances of this value.
