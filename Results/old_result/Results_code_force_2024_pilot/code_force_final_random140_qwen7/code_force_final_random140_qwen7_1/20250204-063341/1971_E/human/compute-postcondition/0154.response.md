Output State: **`i` is 3; `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i - 1` is 1. So, `ad` originally contains `[a[1] - a[0]]`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented to 3, and `ad` now contains `[a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2]]`.
