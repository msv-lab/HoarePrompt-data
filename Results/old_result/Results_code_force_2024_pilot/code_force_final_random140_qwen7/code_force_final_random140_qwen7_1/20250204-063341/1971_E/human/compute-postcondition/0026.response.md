Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` in the range `range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the specified range, i.e., `1 <= i < len(a)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `v` contains `ad[1] / bd[1]`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 1 and increments by default in the range function).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3 in the next iteration.
   - The condition `1 <= i < len(a)` must still hold true for the loop to continue. Since `i` was 2 in the previous iteration and the loop continued, `len(a)` must be at least 3.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `v` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop increment.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `v` contains `ad[1] / bd[1]`**
