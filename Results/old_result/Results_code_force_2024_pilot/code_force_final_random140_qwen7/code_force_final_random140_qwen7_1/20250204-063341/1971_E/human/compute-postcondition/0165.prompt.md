Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `len(a)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive element in `a` from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The list `ad` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a`, starting from the second element up to the last element. This means `ad` will have `len(a) - 1` elements, each representing the difference `a[j] - a[j-1]` for `j` ranging from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1; `b` is a non-empty list; `ad` is an empty list; `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `b` is a non-empty list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`, `bd` is now `[b[1] - b[0], b[i] - b[i - 1]]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `b` is a non-empty list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the values `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]` and will be updated to include `b[3] - b[2]` if `b` has at least 4 elements, `bd` is now `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], b[i] - b[i - 1]]` since `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
