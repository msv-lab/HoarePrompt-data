Output State: **`i` is 4; `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[3] - a[2]`, and `a[4] - a[3]`**.

Explanation: The initial state is `i` is 4, and `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`. The code snippet appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since `i` is 4, `a[i]` is `a[4]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[3]`. Therefore, the new value appended to `ad` is `a[4] - a[3]`. The updated list `ad` now contains `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[3] - a[2]`, and `a[4] - a[3]`.
