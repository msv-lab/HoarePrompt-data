Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for l in range(q):`. The only variables involved here are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `l` will take values from `0` to `q-1` during the loop execution.
   - After the loop completes, `l` will be equal to `q-1`, which is the same as `i` being equal to `len(a)`.

3. **Determine the State of `q`**:
   - Since `l` will run from `0` to `q-1`, and after the loop `l` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, it implies that `q` should be set to `len(a)`.

4. **Determine the State of `v`**:
   - The list `v` is constructed by dividing elements of `ad` by corresponding elements of `bd` starting from `ad[1]` and `bd[1]` up to `ad[len(a)-1]` and `bd[len(a)-1]`.
   - This means `v` will have `len(a) - 1` elements, and these elements will be the results of the divisions.

Given these points, the initial state before the loop starts should be such that `q` is set to `len(a)`, and `v` is an empty list because no divisions have occurred yet.

**State:**
- `q` must be equal to `len(a)`
- `v` is an empty list

So, the final answer is:
State: **`q` is equal to `len(a)`, `v` is an empty list**
