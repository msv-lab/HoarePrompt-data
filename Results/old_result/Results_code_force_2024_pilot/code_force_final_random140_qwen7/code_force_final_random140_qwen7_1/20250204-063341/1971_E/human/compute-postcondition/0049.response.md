Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an input integer minus the value of `a[s-1]`, `v` is an empty list, `m` is 0, `l` is 1, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `ql`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `q`, `v`, `m`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
