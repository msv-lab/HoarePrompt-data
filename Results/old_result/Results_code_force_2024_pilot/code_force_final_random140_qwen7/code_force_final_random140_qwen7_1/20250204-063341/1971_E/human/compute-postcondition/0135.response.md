To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `v` is a list constructed from elements of `ad` and `bd` such that `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into the list `a` to keep it sorted.
   - `ql` is an input integer.
   - `l` is 3.
   - `s` is updated to the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

2. **Key Points**:
   - `bisect_left(a, ql)` returns the index where `ql` should be inserted in the sorted list `a` to maintain the sorted order.
   - Since `s` is updated to this index, `b[s]` refers to the element in the list `b` at the position `s`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `s` in the list `b`.

Given the initial state and the operations, the precise value of `b[s]` depends on the value of `s`, which is determined by the `bisect_left(a, ql)` function. However, without the actual values of `a` and `ql`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`.

Therefore, the output will be the element at index `s` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[s]**
