Output State: `i` is `len(a)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive element in `a` from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The list `ad` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a`, starting from the second element up to the last element. This means `ad` will have `len(a) - 1` elements, each representing the difference `a[j] - a[j-1]` for `j` ranging from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
