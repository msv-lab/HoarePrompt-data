Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to len(b) - 1; `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. The precondition that `i` must be within the range 1 to len(b) - 1 remains valid, and a new element is added to the list `bd`.
