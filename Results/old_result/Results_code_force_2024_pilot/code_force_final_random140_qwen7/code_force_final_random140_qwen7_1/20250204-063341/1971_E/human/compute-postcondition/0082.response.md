Output State: **`ad` is now [0, `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `a[i+1] - a[i]`], `i` is `len(a) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. This means that the length of `ad` increases by one, and the last element of `ad` is now `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. Additionally, since the length of the list `a` has increased by one due to the loop iteration, `i` is updated to be `len(a) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
