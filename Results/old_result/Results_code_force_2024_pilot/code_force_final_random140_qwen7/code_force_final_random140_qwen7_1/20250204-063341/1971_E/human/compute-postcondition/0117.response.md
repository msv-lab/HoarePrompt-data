Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `l`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `q`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`
   - `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`
   - `i` is 1
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted
   - `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop variable `l` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `l` would be `q-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `l` should be `q`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`**
