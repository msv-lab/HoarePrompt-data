Postcondition: `l` is an input integer, `q` must be a positive integer, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. If the value at index `s` of list `a` is equal to `ql`, we continue the loop or iteration we were inside. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
