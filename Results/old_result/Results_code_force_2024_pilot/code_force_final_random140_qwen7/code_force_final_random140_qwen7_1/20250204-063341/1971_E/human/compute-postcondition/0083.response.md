Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ad` is now `[0, a[i] - a[i - 1], a[i + 1] - a[i]]`
   - `i` is `len(a) + 1`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(a)):`

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range from `1` to `len(a)` (inclusive).

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(a) + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is currently `len(a) + 1`, it is outside the range `1` to `len(a)`.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again because `i` does not satisfy the condition `1 <= i < len(a)`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - No changes are needed to the state since the loop will not execute again.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ad` is now `[0, a[i] - a[i - 1], a[i + 1] - a[i]]`, `i` is `len(a) + 1`**
