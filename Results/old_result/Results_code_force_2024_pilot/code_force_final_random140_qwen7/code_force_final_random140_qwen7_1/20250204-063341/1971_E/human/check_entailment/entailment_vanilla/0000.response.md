Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and stores them in `ad` and `bd` respectively. This is done correctly.

3. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed between consecutive points in `a` using the formula `speed = distance / time`. This is also done correctly.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried point `ql` lies. If the queried point exactly matches a known point, it directly outputs the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the additional time required to travel from the previous known point to the queried point using the previously calculated speeds.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the queried point exactly matches a known point, and it correctly rounds down the time to the nearest integer.

6. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the results for each query in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
