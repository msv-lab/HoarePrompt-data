Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.
3. It constructs lists `a` and `b` which represent the positions and times respectively.
4. It calculates the distances between consecutive positions (`ad`) and the corresponding time intervals (`bd`).
5. It computes the speeds (`v`) between consecutive positions using the formula `speed = distance / time`.
6. For each query `d`, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment of the journey where the query falls.
7. If the query point exactly matches a known position, it directly returns the corresponding time.
8. Otherwise, it calculates the additional time required to travel from the last known position to the query point using the previously calculated speed.
9. The program handles multiple test cases and queries as described in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the logic correctly as per the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
