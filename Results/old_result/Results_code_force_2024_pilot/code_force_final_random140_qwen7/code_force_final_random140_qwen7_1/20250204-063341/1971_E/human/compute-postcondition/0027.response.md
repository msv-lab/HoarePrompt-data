Output State: **`i` is 3; `v` contains `[ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3]]`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3 and `v` contains `ad[1] / bd[1]`. The code snippet `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` appends `ad[3] / bd[3]` to the list `v`. Since `i` is 3, the new value is calculated and appended to `v`, making `v` contain both `ad[1] / bd[1]` and `ad[3] / bd[3]`.
