Output State: **`v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `ql` in the list `a`. This insertion point is stored in the variable `s`. The other variables (`v`, `m`, `i`, and `ql`) remain unchanged. The value of `s` depends on the position where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
