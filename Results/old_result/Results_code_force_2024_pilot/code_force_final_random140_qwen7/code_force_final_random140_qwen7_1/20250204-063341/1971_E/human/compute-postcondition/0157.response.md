Output State: `i` is `len(a)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive element in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[len(a)-1]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(a)`. In each iteration, it appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i-1]` to the list `ad`. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `len(a)`, it will append `len(a) - 1` differences to the list `ad`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)` and `ad` will contain the differences between every two consecutive elements starting from `a[1]` to `a[len(a)-1]`.
