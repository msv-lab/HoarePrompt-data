You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

    #State: Output State: All variables will reach their final state after all iterations of the loop have completed.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions will be true:
    #
    #- `i` will be equal to `len(b)`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list `b`.
    #- `q` will be reduced to `0` after all queries have been processed.
    #- `v` will contain the ratio of differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b` for all valid indices, starting from the second element of both lists.
    #- `m` will be the cumulative sum of `b[s-1]` for all `s` from `1` to `len(b) - 1`, plus the sum of `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])` for all `s` from `1` to `len(b) - 1`, reflecting the final accumulated value after processing all queries.
    #- `l` will be `0` since all queries have been processed.
    #- `ql` will be `0` as it gets reduced to zero after processing all queries.
    #- `s` will be the final index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, but since `ql` is `0`, this index will be the last position in the list `a`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations, `i` and `l` will be `len(b)` and `0`, respectively, while `q` will be `0`. The values of `v`, `m`, `ql`, and `s` will reflect the final state after processing all inputs and queries.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and stores them in `ad` and `bd` respectively. This is done correctly.

3. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed between consecutive points in `a` using the formula `speed = distance / time`. This is also done correctly.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried point `ql` lies. If the queried point exactly matches a known point, it directly outputs the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the additional time required to travel from the previous known point to the queried point using the previously calculated speeds.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the queried point exactly matches a known point, and it correctly rounds down the time to the nearest integer.

6. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the results for each query in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
