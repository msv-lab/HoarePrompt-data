### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and stores them in `ad` and `bd` respectively. This is done correctly.

3. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the speed between consecutive points in `a` using the formula `speed = distance / time`. However, there is a critical issue here. The speed calculation should be `speed = distance / time`, but the program incorrectly calculates `v` as `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])`. Since `bd[i]` represents the time taken to travel from `a[i-1]` to `a[i]`, the correct calculation should be `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried point `ql` lies. If the queried point exactly matches a known point, it directly outputs the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the additional time required to travel from the previous known point to the queried point using the previously calculated speeds.
   - The logic for calculating the additional time is correct, but it assumes that the speed between segments is constant, which is true given the problem constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the queried point exactly matches a known point. It correctly rounds down the time to the nearest integer.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the results for each query in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate except for the speed calculation part. The speed calculation should be `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])`, not `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` as it is currently implemented. However, since the speed calculation is correct and the program works as intended for the given constraints, the overall correctness of the program remains true.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct despite the minor issue in the speed calculation summary, as the logic and implementation are accurate and handle the problem constraints effectively.
