Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements, starting with 0 and followed by the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` is greater than 1; all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `bd`) remain unchanged.

In more detail, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `ad` will contain the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a`, starting from the first difference `a[1] - a[0]` up to the last difference `a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]`. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The length of `ad` will be `len(a) - 1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `bd`) will retain their initial or previously calculated states as they are not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `len(a)` must be less than `len(b)`, `bd` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `bd` is `b[2] - b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `len(a)` must be less than `len(b)`, `bd` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `bd` is `b[2] - b[1]`, and `bd` now has the additional element `b[3] - b[2]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4; `len(a)` must be less than `len(b)`; `bd` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `bd` is `b[2] - b[1]`, and now `bd` has the additional element `b[3] - b[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
