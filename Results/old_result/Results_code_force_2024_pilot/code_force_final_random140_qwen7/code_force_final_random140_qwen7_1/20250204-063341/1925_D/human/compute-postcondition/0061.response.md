Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is determined by the final values of `num`, `den`, and `ans` after processing all inputs. Here's a description of the final state:

- `num` is calculated as `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S` divided by the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.
- `den` is `2 * C * C` divided by the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, and then it is the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`.
- `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.
- `ans` is the result of `num * den % MOD`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the final computed value based on the entire set of inputs provided, where `num` and `den` are simplified and `den` is inverted modulo `MOD`.
