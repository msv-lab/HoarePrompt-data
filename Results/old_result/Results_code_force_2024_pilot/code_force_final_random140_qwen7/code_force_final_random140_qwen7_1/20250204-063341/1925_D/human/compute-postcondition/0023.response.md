Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from each list of integers provided by the input, repeated `p` times, `C` is the product of `n` and `(n-1)` divided by 2, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S` divided by the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is simplified by dividing itself with `g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` must be `T - 1`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `p`, and `k` from the input. This affects the values of `n`, `p`, and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial conditions. The values of `S`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `g`, `den`, `ans`, and `T` are yet to be determined based on further operations.
