Output State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from each list of integers provided by the input, repeated `p` times, `C` is the product of n and (n-1) divided by 2, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S` divided by the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is simplified by dividing itself with `g`.**

In this output state, the value of `den` has been updated by dividing itself with its greatest common divisor `g`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
