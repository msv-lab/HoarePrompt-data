Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `p`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < p`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `p` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `S` is the sum of `S` and the third element from the list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `p` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body (based on the given information).

5. **Summarize the New States**:
   - `p` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `S` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `S` is the sum of `S` and the third element from the list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**
