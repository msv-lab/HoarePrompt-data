Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `i` is set to `p-1`.
   - `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`.
   - `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `num` is calculated as `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`.
   - `den` is calculated as `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`.
   - `g` is calculated as `math.gcd(num, den)`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `num * den % MOD`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is `p-1`.
   - `S` is the sum of the third elements from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`. This means if the input is a list of lists where each sublist has at least three elements, `S` would be the sum of the third elements of these sublists.
   - `C` is the combination of `n` taken 2 at a time, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `num` involves `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`. Here, `p * k * k - p * k` is a term involving `p` and `k`, and it is combined with `2 * k * C * S` after taking the gcd with `2 * C * C`.
   - `den` is `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`, meaning it is the result of dividing `2 * C * C` by the gcd of `num` and `den`.
   - `g` is the gcd of `num` and `den`.
   - `ans` is the result of `num * den % MOD`, which is the product of `num` and `den` modulo `MOD`.

3. **Final Calculation and Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(ans)` will print the value of `ans`, which is `num * den % MOD`.

Given the complexity of the expressions involved, without specific values for `p`, `k`, `n`, `S`, `C`, and `MOD`, we cannot simplify further. Therefore, the output will be the computed value of `ans` based on the given formulae.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of num * den % MOD based on the given formulae)**
