Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. This involves understanding the probability of choosing each pair and how the friendship values change over time.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( p \), and \( k \).
   - It then reads the friendship values \( f_i \) for each of the \( p \) pairs.
   - The program calculates the expected value using a specific formula involving \( p \), \( k \), and the sum of the initial friendship values \( S \).

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula used in the code is derived from the problem's requirements. Specifically, the numerator \( \text{num} \) and denominator \( \text{den} \) are calculated based on the number of pairs \( p \), the number of excursions \( k \), and the sum of initial friendship values \( S \).
   - The gcd operation ensures the fraction is simplified.
   - The inverse of the denominator modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) is computed using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the code correctly implements the formula provided in the problem statement.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.
   - The example cases in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
