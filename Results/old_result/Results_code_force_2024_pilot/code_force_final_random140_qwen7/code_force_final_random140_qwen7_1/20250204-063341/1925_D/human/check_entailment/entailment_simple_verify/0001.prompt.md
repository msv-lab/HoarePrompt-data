You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #- `num` is calculated as \( p \times k \times k - p \times k + 2 \times k \times C \times S \), where \( C = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \) and \( S \) is the sum of the third elements from each of the `p` input lists.
    #- `den` is calculated as \( 2 \times C \times C \).
    #- `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.
    #- `num` is then divided by `g` to simplify it.
    #- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `1000000007` (denoted as `pow(den, -1, MOD)`).
    #- Finally, `ans` is computed as \( num \times den \mod 1000000007 \).
    #
    #This process is repeated for each of the `T` test cases, and the final value of `ans` for each case is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program calculates the sum `S` of all friendship values `f_i` from the input.
   - This is done using the line `S += int(input().split()[2])` inside the loop for `p` (which should be `m`).

3. **Total Possible Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the formula `C = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program uses the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values:
     \[
     \text{num} = p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S
     \]
     \[
     \text{den} = 2 \cdot C \cdot C
     \]
   - Here, `p` should be `m`, the number of pairs of friends.

5. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den` using `math.gcd(num, den)`.

6. **Simplification:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both `num` and `den` by their GCD.

7. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `den` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.

8. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final answer using the formula:
     \[
     \text{ans} = (\text{num} \times \text{den}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]

### Verification:

- The logic for calculating the expected value seems correct based on the problem statement.
- The use of modular arithmetic and the calculation of the modular inverse is appropriate.
- However, there is a potential issue with the formula used for the numerator. The formula provided in the explanation might not be accurate for the expected value calculation as described in the problem.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the steps correctly but there is a discrepancy in the formula used for the numerator. The correct formula for the expected value should consider the probability of choosing each pair and the effect of the friendship value increasing over time.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the program does not seem to correctly implement the expected value calculation as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
