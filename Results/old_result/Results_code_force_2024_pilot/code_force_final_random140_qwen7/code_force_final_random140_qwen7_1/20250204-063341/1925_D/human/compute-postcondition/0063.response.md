Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k, along with additional integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. For each test case, it checks if the given conditions are met and returns appropriate results based on the values of n, m, k, and the pairs (a_i, b_i) and their corresponding f_i values.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integers that need to satisfy certain constraints. The function processes these test cases and returns results based on the given conditions without accepting any direct parameters.
