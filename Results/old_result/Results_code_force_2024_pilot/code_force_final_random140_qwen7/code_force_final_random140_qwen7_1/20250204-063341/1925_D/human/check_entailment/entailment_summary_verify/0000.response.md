### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each excursion it is chosen, and it starts at \( f_i \).
- The probability of choosing a pair changes as their friendship value increases.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `MOD` is set to \( 1000000007 \).
   - `T` is read from input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `p`, and `k` are read.
   
2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - `S` is initialized to 0 and then populated with the sum of friendship values \( f_i \) for all pairs.
   - This step is correct as it sums up the initial friendship values.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - `C` is calculated as \( \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \), which represents the total number of possible pairs.
   - The numerator (`num`) and denominator (`den`) are calculated using the formulae:
     \[
     \text{num} = p \times k \times k - p \times k + 2 \times k \times C \times S
     \]
     \[
     \text{den} = 2 \times C \times C
     \]
   - These formulae do not correctly model the expected value of the sum of friendship values over \( k \) excursions.

4. **GCD and Simplification**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den` is computed and used to simplify the fraction.
   - The simplified fraction is then inverted modulo \( 1000000007 \) and printed.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly compute the expected value, we need to consider the probability of choosing each pair at each excursion. The probability of choosing a pair decreases as its friendship value increases. This requires a more complex combinatorial and probabilistic approach, which the given program does not handle.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case:
```
3
4 2 3
1 2 10
2 3 20
```

- There are 4 children, 2 pairs, and 3 excursions.
- Initial friendship values: \( (1, 2, 10) \) and \( (2, 3, 20) \).

The correct expected value calculation involves:
1. Calculating the probability of choosing each pair at each excursion.
2. Adjusting the probabilities as the friendship values increase.

The given program does not perform these calculations correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Final: False**
