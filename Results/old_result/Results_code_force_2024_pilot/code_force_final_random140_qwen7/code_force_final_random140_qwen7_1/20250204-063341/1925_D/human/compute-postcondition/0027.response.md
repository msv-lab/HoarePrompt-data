Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `p`.
   - `i` is the loop counter.
   - `p` is the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Determine the Current Values**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `p` must be a positive integer.
   - `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces (this variable is not part of the loop head).

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < p`.

4. **Update the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < p`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - `p` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `S` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be updated here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `p` must be a positive integer**
