Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the expected value.

The program assumes that the friendship values increase linearly over k excursions, but it fails to account for the fact that the probability of choosing a specific pair changes as their friendship value increases. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value considering the changing probabilities due to the increased friendship values.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
3
4 2 3
1 2 10
2 3 20
```

The correct expected value calculation would involve considering the changing probabilities of selecting each pair over the k excursions. The given program does not handle this correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
