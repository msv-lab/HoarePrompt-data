Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, `den` is `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`, `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`**

Explanation: The code divides the value of `den` by `g`. Since `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, dividing `den` by `g` simplifies the fraction represented by `num` and `den`. The values of `i`, `p`, `S`, `C`, `num`, and `g` remain unchanged.
