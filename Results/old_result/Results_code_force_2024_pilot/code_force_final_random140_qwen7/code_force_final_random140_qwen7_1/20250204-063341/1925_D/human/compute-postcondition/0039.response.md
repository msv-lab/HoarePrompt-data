Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, `den` is `2 * C * C // math.gcd(num, den)`, `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `ans` using the formula `ans = num * den % MOD`. The values of `num` and `den` are derived from the initial conditions, and `ans` is computed based on these values. The other variables (`i`, `S`, `C`, `g`, `den`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
