Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is `math.gcd(num, den)`**.

In this output state, the variable `g` has been assigned the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `num` and `den`. All other variables retain their previous values or expressions as described in the initial state.
