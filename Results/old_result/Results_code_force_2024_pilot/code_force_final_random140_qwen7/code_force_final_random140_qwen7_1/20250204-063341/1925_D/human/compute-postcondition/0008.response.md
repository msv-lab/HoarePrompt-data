Output State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `S` is the sum of its previous value and the third element from the list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `S` by adding the third element from the list of integers obtained from the input (split by spaces) to its current value. The values of `p` and `i` remain unchanged.
