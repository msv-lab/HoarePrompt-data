Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is determined by the final values of the variables `num`, `den`, and `ans` after processing all inputs. Here's the description in natural language:

- `num` is calculated as \( p \times k \times k - p \times k + 2 \times k \times C \times S \), where \( C = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \) and \( S \) is the sum of the third elements from each of the `p` input lists.
- `den` is calculated as \( 2 \times C \times C \).
- `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.
- `num` is then divided by `g` to simplify it.
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `1000000007` (denoted as `pow(den, -1, MOD)`).
- Finally, `ans` is computed as \( num \times den \mod 1000000007 \).

This process is repeated for each of the `T` test cases, and the final value of `ans` for each case is printed.
