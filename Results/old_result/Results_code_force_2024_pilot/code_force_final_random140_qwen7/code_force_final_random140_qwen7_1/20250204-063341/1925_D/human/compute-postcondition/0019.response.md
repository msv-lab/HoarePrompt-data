Output State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from each list of integers provided by the input, repeated `p` times, `C` is the product of n and (n-1) divided by 2, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S` divided by the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is simplified by dividing itself with `g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` using the `pow()` function with three arguments: the value of `den`, `-1` as the exponent, and `MOD` as the modulus. This operation does not change the values of the other variables, but it updates `den` to its modular multiplicative inverse under the given modulus `MOD`.
