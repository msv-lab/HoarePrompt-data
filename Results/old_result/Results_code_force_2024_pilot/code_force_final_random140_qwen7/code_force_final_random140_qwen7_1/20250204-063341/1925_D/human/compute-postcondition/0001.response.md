Output State: **`T` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 5⋅10^4, and `MOD` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. The initial state of `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), and `MOD` is fixed at 1000000007. After executing the code, `t` is renamed to `T`, and its constraints remain the same. The value of `MOD` remains unchanged.
