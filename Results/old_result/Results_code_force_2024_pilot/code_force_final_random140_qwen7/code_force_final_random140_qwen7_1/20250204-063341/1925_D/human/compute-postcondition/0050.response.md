Output State: `i` is equal to `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from each input split by space for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `p-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `p-1`), `p` must still be greater than 0, and `S` will be the cumulative sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each of the `p` iterations.
