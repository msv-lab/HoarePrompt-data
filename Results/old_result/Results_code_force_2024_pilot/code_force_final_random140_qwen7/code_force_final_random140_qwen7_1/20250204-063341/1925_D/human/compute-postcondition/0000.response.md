Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, MOD is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the constant value `1000000007` to the variable `MOD`. No other variables are affected, so the value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `MOD` and retains the original range and properties of `t`.
