Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.**

Explanation: The code divides `num` by `g`, which is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `p`, `S`, `C`, `den`, or `g`. The value of `num` is updated to `num // g`.
