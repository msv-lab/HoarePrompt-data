Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`**.

This means that the variable `num` is now assigned the value of the expression `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or previously calculated values.
