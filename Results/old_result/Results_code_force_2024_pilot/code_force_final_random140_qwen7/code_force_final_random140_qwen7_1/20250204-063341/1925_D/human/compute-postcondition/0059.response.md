Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `num // g`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `C * C` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `ans` as `num * den % MOD`. The values of `num` and `den` are updated, but the values of `i`, `p`, `S`, `C`, and `MOD` remain unchanged. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `ans` is calculated based on the updated `num` and `den`.
