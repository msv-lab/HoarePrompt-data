Output State: **`p` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `p-1`, `S` is the sum of the third element from each list of integers provided by the input, repeated `p` times, `C` is the product of n and (n-1) divided by 2, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`**.

This means that the value of `num` is calculated as `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, while the values of `p`, `i`, `S`, and `C` remain unchanged from their initial states.
