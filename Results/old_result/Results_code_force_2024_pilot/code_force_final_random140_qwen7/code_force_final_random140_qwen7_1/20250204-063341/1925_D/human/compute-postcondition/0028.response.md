Output State: **`i` is 1, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is increased by the third element from the list obtained by splitting the input string and converting it to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings, converts the third element of this list to an integer, and adds this integer to the variable `S`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
