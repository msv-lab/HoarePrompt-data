You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is determined by the final values of the variables `num`, `den`, and `ans` after processing all inputs. Here's the description in natural language:
    #
    #- `num` is calculated as \( p \times k \times k - p \times k + 2 \times k \times C \times S \), where \( C = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \) and \( S \) is the sum of the third elements from each of the `p` input lists.
    #- `den` is calculated as \( 2 \times C \times C \).
    #- `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.
    #- `num` is then divided by `g` to simplify it.
    #- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `1000000007` (denoted as `pow(den, -1, MOD)`).
    #- Finally, `ans` is computed as \( num \times den \mod 1000000007 \).
    #
    #This process is repeated for each of the `T` test cases, and the final value of `ans` for each case is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers \( T \), \( n \), \( p \), and \( k \), along with additional integers \( a_i \), \( b_i \), and \( f_i \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given inputs and prints the result. Specifically, it computes a simplified fraction \( \frac{\text{num}}{\text{den}} \) modulo \( 1000000007 \), where \( \text{num} \) and \( \text{den} \) are derived from the input values, and then prints the numerator of the simplified fraction.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the expected value.

The program assumes that the friendship values increase linearly over k excursions, but it fails to account for the fact that the probability of choosing a specific pair changes as their friendship value increases. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value considering the changing probabilities due to the increased friendship values.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
3
4 2 3
1 2 10
2 3 20
```

The correct expected value calculation would involve considering the changing probabilities of selecting each pair over the k excursions. The given program does not handle this correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
