Output State: **`S` is 0, `C` is the product of `n` and `(n-1)` divided by 2, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S` divided by the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`, `den` is simplified by dividing itself with `g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` must be `T - 1`**.

Explanation:
- The code initializes `S` to 0.
- All other variables (`C`, `num`, `den`, `g`, `ans`, `T`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Since `S` is now explicitly set to 0, this is the new value for `S`.
