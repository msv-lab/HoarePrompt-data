You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Additionally, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, p, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        S = 0
        
        for i in range(p):
            S += int(input().split()[2])
        
        C = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
        
        den = 2 * C * C
        
        g = math.gcd(num, den)
        
        num = num // g
        
        den = den // g
        
        den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
        
        ans = num * den % MOD
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is determined by the final values of the variables `num`, `den`, and `ans` after processing all inputs. Here's the description in natural language:
    #
    #- `num` is calculated as \( p \times k \times k - p \times k + 2 \times k \times C \times S \), where \( C = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \) and \( S \) is the sum of the third elements from each of the `p` input lists.
    #- `den` is calculated as \( 2 \times C \times C \).
    #- `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.
    #- `num` is then divided by `g` to simplify it.
    #- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `1000000007` (denoted as `pow(den, -1, MOD)`).
    #- Finally, `ans` is computed as \( num \times den \mod 1000000007 \).
    #
    #This process is repeated for each of the `T` test cases, and the final value of `ans` for each case is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k, along with additional integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. For each test case, it checks if the given conditions are met and returns appropriate results based on the values of n, m, k, and the pairs (a_i, b_i) and their corresponding f_i values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
