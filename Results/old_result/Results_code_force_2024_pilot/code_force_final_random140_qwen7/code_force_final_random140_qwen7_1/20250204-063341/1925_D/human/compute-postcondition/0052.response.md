Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be greater than 0, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`**.

In this output state, the variable `i` remains `p-1` because the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `p` must still be greater than 0. The variable `S` remains the sum of the third element from the input split by space for each of the `p` iterations. The variable `C` is now calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
