Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n`, `p`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers (`n`, `p`, and `k`) from the input using the `input().split()` method and assigns them to the variables `n`, `p`, and `k` respectively. The values of `T` and `MOD` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` must still be greater than 0, and `MOD` remains 1000000007. The values of `n`, `p`, and `k` are now known but their specific values depend on the input provided by the user.
