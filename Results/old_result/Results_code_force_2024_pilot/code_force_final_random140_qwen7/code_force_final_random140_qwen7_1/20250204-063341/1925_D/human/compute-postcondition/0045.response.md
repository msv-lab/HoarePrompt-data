Output State: **`i` is 0, `p` must be greater than 0, S is the sum of the third element from input split by space**.

Explanation: The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` takes an input from the user, splits it by spaces, and adds the third element (index 2) converted to an integer to the variable `S`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
