Output State: **`i` is `p-1`, `p` must be a positive integer, `S` is the sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each iteration from 0 to `p-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `p-1` because the loop runs from 0 to `p-1`. The variable `p` must remain a positive integer as it was initially. The variable `S` will be the cumulative sum of the third element from the input split by spaces for each of the `p` iterations of the loop.
