Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       n = int(input())
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of the permutation for each test case.

2. **Finding `ans1`**:
   ```python
   ans1 = 0
   for i in range(1, n):
       x = func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)
       if x == '<':
           ans1 = i
   ```
   Here, the code attempts to find the index `i` such that `(p_ans1 | p_ans1) < (p_i | p_i)`. However, this logic is flawed because it only checks the bitwise OR with itself, which doesn't help in finding the maximum XOR. This loop should be checking different pairs to find the maximum OR value.

3. **Finding Maximum OR Value (`mx`) and Corresponding Indices (`v`)**:
   ```python
   mx = 0
   v = [0]
   for i in range(1, n):
       x = func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)
       if x == '<':
           v = []
           mx = i
           v.append(i)
       elif x == '=':
           v.append(i)
   ```
   This part tries to find the index `i` such that `(p_mx | p_ans1) < (p_i | p_ans1)`. Again, this logic is incorrect. It should be comparing different pairs to find the maximum OR value.

4. **Selecting the Best Candidate (`ans`)**:
   ```python
   mx = v[0]
   print(v)
   ans = v[0]
   for i in range(1, len(v)):
       x = func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])
       if x == '>':
           ans = v[i]
   print('!', ans, ans1)
   ```
   This part selects the best candidate from `v` but again uses the wrong logic. It should compare different pairs to find the maximum XOR value.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the queries effectively to find the maximum XOR. Hereâ€™s a revised approach:

1. Use a binary search-like strategy to narrow down the potential candidates.
2. Compare pairs to determine the maximum XOR.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def find_max_xor(n):
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        print(f'? {low} {mid} {high} {mid}')
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    max_xor = 0
    max_indices = (0, 0)
    
    # Find the index with the highest bit set
    idx = find_max_xor(n)
    
    # Query to find the other index
    print(f'? {idx} {idx} 0 1')
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        other_idx = 0
    else:
        other_idx = 1
    
    # Calculate the maximum XOR
    max_xor = (1 << idx.bit_length()) - 1
    print(f'! {other_idx} {idx}')
```

### Conclusion

The original code is incorrect due to flawed logic in finding the maximum OR value and the maximum XOR value. The revised approach uses a binary search-like method to find the index with the highest bit set and then determines the other index to achieve the maximum XOR.

**Correctness: **False**
