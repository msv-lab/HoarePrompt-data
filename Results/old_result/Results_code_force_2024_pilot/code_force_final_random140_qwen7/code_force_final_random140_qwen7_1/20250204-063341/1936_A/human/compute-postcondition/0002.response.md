The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. These parameters are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\), and `n` is a positive integer with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\). The function returns an input value from the user, as indicated by the return statement which calls for user input without providing a specific value in the initial state.

Functionality: **The function accepts four non-negative integer parameters a, b, c, and d, and returns a value input by the user.**
