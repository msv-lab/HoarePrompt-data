Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries.
2. The program iterates through the indices to find potential candidates for maximizing the XOR value.
3. The program uses the `func_1` function to query the relative values of bitwise OR operations, which helps in narrowing down the indices that could potentially maximize the XOR.
4. The program logic seems to be attempting to identify the maximum XOR value by comparing different indices and filtering them based on the results of the queries.
5. However, the program has several issues:
   - The `func_1` function is not correctly implemented. It only compares two pairs of indices but does not actually perform the bitwise OR operations as required by the problem statement.
   - The program does not correctly handle the results of the queries to identify the maximum XOR value.
   - The program does not ensure that the number of queries does not exceed \(3n\).
   - The program does not properly identify the indices that maximize the XOR value.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
