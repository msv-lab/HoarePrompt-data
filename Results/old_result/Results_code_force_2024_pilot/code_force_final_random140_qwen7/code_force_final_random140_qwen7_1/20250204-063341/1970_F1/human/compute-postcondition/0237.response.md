Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `time` is incremented by 1.
   - `comand` is a list of strings.
   - `obj` is the first element of `comand`.
   - `com` is the second element of `comand`.
   - `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`.
   - `team` is the result of calling `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `time` is incremented by 1, so it is now `time + 1`.
- `obj` is an index into the `comand` list.
- `com` is another index into the `comand` list.
- `pos` is a tuple representing the position, which is derived from `elements[obj]`.
- `nxt` is a new position calculated based on `pos` and `mov[com]`.
- `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`.
- `team` is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)`.

The `print` statement will output a string formatted as follows:
- `%d` will be replaced by the value of `time + 1`.
- `%s` will be replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **(time + 1) GoalName[team]**
