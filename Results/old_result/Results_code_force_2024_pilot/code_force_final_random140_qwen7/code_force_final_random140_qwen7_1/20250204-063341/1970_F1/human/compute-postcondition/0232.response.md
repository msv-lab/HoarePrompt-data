Output State: **`time` is incremented by 1, `comand` is a list of strings, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])**.

This means that the `nxt` variable is now a tuple containing the updated position calculated by adding the movement specified in `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
