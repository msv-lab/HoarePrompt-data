Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the second element of the `command` list to `obj`, the third element to both `com` and `el`. The first element of `command` remains unchanged, and `pos` is undefined as it was not mentioned in the assignment.
