Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `time` is incremented by 1. This means `time` is now some integer value, let's call it `t` (since the exact value is not specified, we'll use `t`).
   - `comand` is a list of strings. The specific content of this list is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `obj`.
   - `obj` is an element from the list `comand`. Since the exact value of `obj` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `team`.
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else 0. So, `team` can either be 1 or 0 depending on the first character of `obj`.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10. This means `points[team]` is now `points[team] + 10`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

Given the above breakdown, we know:
- `time` is `t`.
- `team` is either 1 or 0.
- `GoalName` is a list of strings, but the specific name corresponding to `team` is not provided, so we'll denote it as `GoalName[team]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with `time` and the appropriate goal name based on `team`.

Output: **%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where %d is the incremented time value and %s is the goal name corresponding to team, which is either 'B' or 'H' based on the first character of obj)**
