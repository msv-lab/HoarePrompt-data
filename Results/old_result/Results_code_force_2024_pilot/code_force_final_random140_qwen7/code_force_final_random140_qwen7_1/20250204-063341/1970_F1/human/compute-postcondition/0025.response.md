Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. If `line[ind] != '..'`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.
