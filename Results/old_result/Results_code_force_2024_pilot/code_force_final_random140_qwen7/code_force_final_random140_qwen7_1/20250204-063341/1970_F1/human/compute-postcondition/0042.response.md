Output State: **`i` is 1, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0, `goal[tmp]` is `[('i', 'ind')]`**

Explanation: The line of code `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state where `tmp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `ind` is 3, the tuple `(1, 3)` is appended to `goal[0]`. Since `goal` was not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be a list of lists. After appending, `goal[0]` contains `[('i', 'ind')]`, which is the same as `[('1', '3')]` given the values of `i` and `ind`.
