#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string contains pairs of characters. elements is a dictionary mapping each entity (player, goal, Quaffle) to its position on the grid. allPlayers is a dictionary indicating whether a player is carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of lists, where each sublist contains the positions of the goals for each team. points is a list of integers representing the current scores for the red and blue teams. mov is a dictionary mapping each direction (U, D, L, R) to its corresponding movement vector. t is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game.

    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the `line` list (which is also the length of the single element in the `grid` list). The value of `ind` will be `n-1` as well, since the loop iterates over the indices of `line` starting from 0 until `n-1`. For each index `ind` where `line[ind] != '..'`, the following conditions hold: `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is set to 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else 1, and the list `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`. The `grid` list will contain `n` lines, each line being a list of strings read from standard input. The `elements` dictionary will map each non-empty cell in the grid to its coordinates, the `allPlayers` dictionary will mark players as `False`, and the `goal` list will contain positions of goals for each team.

    #State: Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in the following conditions:
    #
    #- The variable `t` will hold the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is the final value after all iterations.
    #- The variable `comand` will contain the last command read from the standard input, split and stripped.
    #- The variable `obj` will be the first element of the last `comand`.
    #- The variable `com` will be the second element of the last `comand`.
    #- If the length of `comand` is 3, `el` will be the third element of the last `comand`.
    #- The variable `pos` will be the value of the element in the `elements` dictionary at the key `obj` after the last iteration.
    #- The variable `nxt` will be the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])` if `comand` has two elements and `obj` is not '.B'. If `obj` is '.B' and the next position is occupied by a player, `nxt` will be the player's position. If `obj` is a player and the next position is occupied by '.B', `nxt` will be the position of '.B'.
    #- The variable `player` will be set to `obj` if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is also a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is where the black piece ('.B') is located. Otherwise, `player` will be `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if the next position `nxt` is valid.
    #- The dictionaries `allPlayers` and `points` will be updated according to the commands executed during the loop.
    #- The list `goal` will remain unchanged unless a goal is scored during the loop, in which case the corresponding team's score will be incremented by 1.
    #- The `elements` dictionary will be updated to reflect the new positions of the players and the black piece ('.B') after each iteration.
    #- The `grid` will remain unchanged unless a player moves to a new position or a player is eliminated, in which case the grid will reflect these changes.

    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a game scenario represented by a grid, players, and goals. It reads initial setup data from standard input, including the grid dimensions, grid content, and game parameters. It then processes a series of commands for each game step, updating player positions, handling golden snitch catches, eliminations, and goal scoring. Finally, it prints the final scores for both teams.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a string representing a position on the field, where the field is described as a grid with N rows and M columns, and each position can be either empty (..), a player (R0-R9 or B0-B9), a goal (RG or BG), or the Quaffle (.Q). The function `goalIn` determines whether the given position is a goal for the red team (returning 0), the blue team (returning 1), or neither (returning -1).
def goalIn(pos):
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns res which is 0 if pos is in goal[0], 1 if pos is in goal[1], and -1 otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `goalIn` accepts a parameter `pos`, which is a string representing a position on a field grid. It checks if `pos` is a red team goal (RG) and returns 0 if true; if `pos` is a blue team goal (BG), it returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string representing an entity on the field, where the first character indicates the team (R for Red, B for Blue) and the second character (if present) indicates the player number (0-9) or G indicating a goal (RG for Red goal, BG for Blue goal).
def isPlayer(el):
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns res which is True if el starts with 'B' or 'R' and does not end with 'G', otherwise it is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `isPlayer` accepts a string `el` representing an entity on the field. It checks if `el` starts with either 'B' or 'R' and does not end with 'G'. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
