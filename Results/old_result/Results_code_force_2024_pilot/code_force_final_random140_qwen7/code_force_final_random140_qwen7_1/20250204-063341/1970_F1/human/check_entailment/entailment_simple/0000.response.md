Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly defines the necessary functions and initializes the required data structures (`grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `mov`).
   - The input parsing logic is correct, ensuring that the grid, elements, and initial positions are properly stored and initialized.

2. **Game Execution Loop:**
   - The loop correctly processes each step of the game, handling movements, catches, and throws of the Quaffle.
   - The logic for checking if a player is carrying the Quaffle and updating their state is correct.
   - The scoring mechanism is implemented correctly, ensuring that points are awarded when a player successfully scores in the opponent's goal.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program correctly prints the events as they occur during the game, including scoring events and the final score.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

4. **Helper Functions:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly identifies whether a given position is a goal for the red or blue team.
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies whether a given entity is a player.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the problem specification without any logical errors or inconsistencies.

Correctness: **True**
