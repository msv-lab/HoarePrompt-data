Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in the following conditions:

- The variable `t` has been decremented to 0 after all iterations of the loop.
- The variable `comand` contains the final command read from the standard input, stripped and split, after the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `obj` is the first element of `comand` after the last iteration.
- The variable `com` is the second element of `comand` after the last iteration.
- If the length of `comand` is 3, then `el` is the third element of `comand` after the last iteration.
- The variable `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` dictionary at the key `obj`, reflecting its final position after all movements and interactions during the loop.
- The variable `nxt` is a tuple representing the intended next position for `obj` after the last movement attempt, calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
- The variable `player` is either `obj` if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is also a player, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is a player and `nxt` is occupied by another player, or remains `obj` if the movement does not result in an elimination.
- The variable `team` is determined based on whether `obj` is a black piece ('.B') or a white piece ('.W'), and `points[team]` reflects the total points accumulated for each team throughout the loop's iterations.
- The variable `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True` if `obj` is a player and the command was to capture a golden snitch ('.Q').
- The variable `goal` lists the positions of goals for each team, and any team that reaches a goal will have points incremented accordingly.
- The `elements` dictionary and `allPlayers` dictionary reflect the final state of all players and their positions after all movements and interactions.
- The `grid` represents the final state of the game board after all movements and interactions, with players and goals in their respective positions.
