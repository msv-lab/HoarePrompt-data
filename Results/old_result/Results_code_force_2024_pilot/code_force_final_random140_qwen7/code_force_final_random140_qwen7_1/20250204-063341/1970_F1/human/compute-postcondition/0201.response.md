Output State: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `elements[obj]` to the variable `pos`. The values of `obj` and `com` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `pos` now holds the value of the element in the `elements` list at the index specified by `obj`.
