Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `obj` is the second element of `command`.
   - `com` is the first element of `command`.
   - `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is calculated as `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `time` and `team` to understand what will be printed.

- Since `time` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it remains as `time`.
- `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, but `pos` is derived from `elements[obj]`, and `obj` is the second element of `command`. Therefore, `pos` is `elements[command[1]]`.

Without knowing the exact values of `time`, `elements`, `mov`, `command`, and the function `goalIn`, we cannot determine the exact value of `team`. However, we can describe the structure of the output based on the given information.

Output: **%d [team] GOAL** (where `[team]` is the result of `goalIn(elements[command[1]])` and `%d` represents the value of `time`).
