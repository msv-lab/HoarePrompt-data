Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function correctly initializes the grid, players, goals, and points.
   - It processes each command step-by-step, updating player positions and handling actions like catching, throwing, and moving.
   - It correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the points accordingly.
   - It handles golden snitch catches and player eliminations as specified.
   - It prints the final scores at the end of the game.

2. **Function `goalIn(pos)`**:
   - This function correctly identifies whether a given position is a goal for the red or blue team.
   - It returns 0 for a red goal, 1 for a blue goal, and -1 for neither.

3. **Function `isPlayer(el)`**:
   - This function correctly identifies whether an entity is a player (not a goal).
   - It checks if the entity starts with 'B' or 'R' and is not a goal (ends with 'G').

Given the descriptions and the execution summaries, the functions collectively handle the problem requirements accurately. The program processes the game state correctly, updates the positions and actions of players and balls, and determines the scores and final outcomes as specified.

Correctness: **True**
