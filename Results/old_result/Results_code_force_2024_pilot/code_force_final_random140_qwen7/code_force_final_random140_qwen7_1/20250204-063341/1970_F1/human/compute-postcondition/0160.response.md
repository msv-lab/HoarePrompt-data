Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. The condition `(obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt))` is true.**
