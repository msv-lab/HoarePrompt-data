Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `comand` is a list of strings obtained from standard input, stripped and split.
   - `obj` is the first element of `comand`.
   - `com` is the second element of `comand`.
   - `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.
   - `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`.
   - `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True else `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of the variables involved in the print statement:

- `time`: This is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We cannot determine its value without additional information. Therefore, we will leave it as `time`.
- `player`: The value of `player` depends on the result of `isPlayer(obj)`. If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `time` and the specific conditions for `isPlayer(obj)` and the contents of `grid`, we can only describe the format of the output based on the given information.

**Output:**
Output: **time %d obj ELIMINATED** if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, or **time %d grid[pos[0] + mov[com][0]][pos[1] + mov[com][1]] ELIMINATED** otherwise.
