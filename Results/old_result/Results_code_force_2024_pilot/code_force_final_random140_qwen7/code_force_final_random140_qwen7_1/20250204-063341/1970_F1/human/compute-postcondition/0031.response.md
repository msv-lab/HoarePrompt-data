Output State: **`i` is 1; `ind` is 2; `tmp` is 0 if line[2][0] == 'B' else 1; `goal[tmp]` contains a list with the tuple `(1, 2)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition `line[2][0] == 'B'`. After executing the code, `goal[tmp]` will contain the tuple `(1, 2)`. The values of `i` and `ind` remain unchanged.
