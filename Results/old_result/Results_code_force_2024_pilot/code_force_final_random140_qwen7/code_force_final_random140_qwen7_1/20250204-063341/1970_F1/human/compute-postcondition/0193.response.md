Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, and `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`.**

In this output state, the `allPlayers` dictionary has been updated such that the key `obj` (which is the second element of the `command` list) is set to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
