Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `nxt` has been updated to a new position calculated by adding the movement values specified in the dictionary `mov` corresponding to the command `com` to the current position `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
