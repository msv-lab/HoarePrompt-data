Postcondition: `ind` is either 0 or 1, `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'. Depending on the value of `line[ind]`:
- If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True and the value is not `'G'`, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
- If `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, `tmp` is set to 1 and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.
- Otherwise, `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` remains unchanged.
