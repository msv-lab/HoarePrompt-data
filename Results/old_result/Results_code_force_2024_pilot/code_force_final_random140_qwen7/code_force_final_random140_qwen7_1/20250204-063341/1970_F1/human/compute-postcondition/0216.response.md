Postcondition: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, `player` is set to `obj` if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is also a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is where the black piece ('.B') is located, otherwise `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]` and `pos` is set to `nxt` if the goal is reached from the current position `pos` or the player at `obj` is valid, and `elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`.**
