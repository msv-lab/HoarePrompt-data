Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(stdin.readline().strip())`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `ind` is equal to `n-1`, `elements` dictionary maps non-empty cells to their coordinates, `allPlayers` dictionary marks players as `False`, and `goal` list contains positions of goals for each team.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, and `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`. 

- If `len(comand) == 3`, then:
  - If `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True.
  - If `el` is equal to '.S':
    - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10.
    - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1, and `points[team]` is increased by 10.
  - If `el` is neither '.Q' nor '.S', no changes occur.

- Otherwise (`len(comand) != 3`):
  - `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.
  - If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true or `isPlayer(obj)` is true and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then `obj` remains unchanged and `com` is not equal to 'T'.
  - If `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, `isPlayer(obj)` is true, and `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`, then:
    - If `com` is 'T', `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1.
    - Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` and `com` is not equal to 'T'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`. If the length of `command` is 3, `el` is the third element of `command`. 

- If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`.
- If `el` is '.', `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else 0; `points[team]` is increased by 10.
- If the length of `command` is not 3, `player` is set to `obj` if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is also a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is where the black piece ('.B') is located, otherwise `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]` and `pos` is set to `nxt` if the goal is reached from the current position `pos` or the player at `obj` is valid, and `elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `time` is incremented by 1, `comand` is a list of strings, `obj` is an element from the list `comand`. If `len(comand) == 3`, then `obj` is an element from the list, and based on the value of `el` or the first character of `obj`, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`, `team` is determined as 1 or 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. Otherwise, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `nxt` is occupied by a player, or if `obj` is a player and `nxt` is occupied by '.B', then `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
