Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m, which are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. It also accepts a 2D list of strings representing the field, a dictionary mapping entities to their positions, a dictionary indicating whether a player is carrying the Quaffle, a list of lists containing goal positions, a list of integers representing scores, and a dictionary mapping directions to movement vectors. Additionally, it accepts a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game. The function does not return anything.**

This means the function `func_1` processes a game scenario involving a field, players, goals, and Quaffle, along with their positions and movements, and does not produce any output directly but likely updates the game state or performs some internal logic based on the given parameters.
