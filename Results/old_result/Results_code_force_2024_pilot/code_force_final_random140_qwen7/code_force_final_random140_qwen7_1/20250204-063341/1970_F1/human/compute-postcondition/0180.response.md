Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, `isPlayer(obj)` is true, and `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`, and `com` is not equal to 'T'. This is because if `isPlayer(obj)` is true, then `obj`'s position is updated to `nxt` and the other conditions remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of the if condition's outcome.
