Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ind` and it iterates over the range of `len(line)`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ind` is 2

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `ind` is less than `len(line)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ind` starts from 2 (as per the previous iteration), for the next iteration, `ind` will be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged unless there is a specific condition inside the loop that changes it, but based on the given postcondition, `i` does not change in the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect the updated value of `ind` and keep `i` unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `ind` is 3**
