Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`, and if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.
