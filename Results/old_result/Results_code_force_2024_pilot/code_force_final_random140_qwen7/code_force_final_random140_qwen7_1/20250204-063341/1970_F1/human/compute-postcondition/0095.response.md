Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ind` will be equal to the length of `line`.
   - `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-`'..'` element in `line`.
   - `allPlayers` is updated for any player elements in `line`.
   - `goal` contains tuples `(i, index)` for each goal element in `line` that belongs to a player.
   - `tmp` determines which list in `goal` to append to based on the first character of the goal element.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop variable is `i`, we need to adjust its value.
   - The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1 + 1 = n`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `ind`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `tmp` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ind` will be equal to the length of `line`, `elements` will contain key-value pairs for each non-`'..'` element in `line`, `allPlayers` will be updated for any player elements in `line`, `goal` will contain tuples `(i, index)` for each goal element in `line` that belongs to a player, `tmp` will determine which list in `goal` to append to based on the first character of the goal element, and `i` will be `n`**.
