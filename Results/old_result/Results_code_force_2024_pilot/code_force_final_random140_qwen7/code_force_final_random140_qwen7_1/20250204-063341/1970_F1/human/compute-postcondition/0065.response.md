Output State: **`ind` is 1, `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the value `i`, and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, `goal[1]` contains the tuple `(i, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given that `tmp` is 1, the tuple `(i, 1)` is added to `goal[1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
