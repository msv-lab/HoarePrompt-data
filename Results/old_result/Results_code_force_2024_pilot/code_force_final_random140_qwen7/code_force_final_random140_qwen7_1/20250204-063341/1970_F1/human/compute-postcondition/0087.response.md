Output State: **`ind` is 5, `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0]` equals 'B' else 1, `goal[tmp]` contains an additional element `(i, 5)`**.

Explanation: The code `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `ind` is 5, the tuple added to `goal[tmp]` is `(i, 5)`. The values of `ind` and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `tmp` depends on the condition `line[4][0] == 'B'`, which is preserved in the output state.
