Postcondition: `ind` is 1, `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.
