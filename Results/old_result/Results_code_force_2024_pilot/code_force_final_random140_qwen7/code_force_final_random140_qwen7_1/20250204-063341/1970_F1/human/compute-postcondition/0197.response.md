Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.S', then `team` is set to 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else 0; points[team] is increased by 10. If `el` is not equal to '.S', no changes are made to `team` and `points`.
