Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `pos` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `command`. The variables `obj` and `com` are defined as the first and second elements of `command`, respectively. However, the variable `pos` is not updated by this code, so its value remains undefined.
