Postcondition: **`elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, `ind` is 1 (if it was 0 previously) or 2 (if it was 1 previously), `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is either assigned the tuple `(i, ind)` or not assigned, depending on whether `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True or False, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. It ensures that the conditions specified in the precondition are maintained and updated as per the logic inside the if and else blocks.
