Output State: **`time` is incremented by 1, `comand` is a list of strings, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`, `team` is the result of calling `goalIn(pos)`**.

This means that the function `goalIn(pos)` has been called with the current position `pos`, and its return value (whether a goal was scored or not) is stored in the variable `team`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
