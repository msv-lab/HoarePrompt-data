Postcondition: `time` is incremented by 1, `comand` is a list of strings, `obj` is an element from the list `comand`. If `len(comand) == 3`, then `obj` is an element from the list, and based on the value of `el` or the first character of `obj`, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`, `team` is determined as 1 or 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. Otherwise, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `nxt` is occupied by a player, or if `obj` is a player and `nxt` is occupied by '.B', then `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
