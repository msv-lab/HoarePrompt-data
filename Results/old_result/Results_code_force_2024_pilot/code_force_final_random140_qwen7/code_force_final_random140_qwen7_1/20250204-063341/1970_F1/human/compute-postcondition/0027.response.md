Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `ind`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `ind` is less than `len(line)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99.
   - `line` is a list of strings that must have at least one element.
   - `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`.
   - Additional conditions based on the value of `line[ind]`:
     - If `line[ind] != '..'`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`.
     - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`.
     - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `line` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `grid` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ind` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `ind` must be less than `len(line)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `ind` while keeping other variables unchanged.

**State:**
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99.
- `line` is a list of strings that must have at least one element.
- `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`.
- `ind` is 1 (assuming `ind` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `ind` is 1**.
