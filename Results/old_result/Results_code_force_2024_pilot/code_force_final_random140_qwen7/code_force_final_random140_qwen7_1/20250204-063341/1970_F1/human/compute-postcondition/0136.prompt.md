Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `grid` now contains the list `line`, while `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `tmp`, and `i` retain their original values.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ind` is either 0 or 1, `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is either assigned the tuple `(i, ind)` or not assigned, depending on whether `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True or False. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True and the value is not `'G'`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, then `tmp` is set to 1 and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ind` is 1 (if it was 0 previously) or 2 (if it was 1 previously), `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 2 (if it was 1 previously) or 3 (if it was 2 previously), `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`. `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
