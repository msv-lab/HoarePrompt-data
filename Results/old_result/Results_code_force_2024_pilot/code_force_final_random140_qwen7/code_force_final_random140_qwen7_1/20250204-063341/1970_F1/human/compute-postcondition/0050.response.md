Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the `line` list.
   - `ind` will be `n-1` as well.
   - For each index `ind` where `line[ind] != '..'`, the following conditions hold:
     - `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`.
     - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
     - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is set to 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else 1, and the list `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` will be `0` if it was `n-1` before.
   - Therefore, `i` will change from `n-1` to `0`.
   - `ind` will also change from `n-1` to `0` because the loop iterates over the indices of `line` starting from `0` until `n-1`.

4. **Conditions to Check:**
   - For each index `ind` where `line[ind] != '..'`, the conditions will be checked again.
   - The conditions inside the loop body will be applied to the new value of `i` and `ind`.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `0`.
   - `ind` will be `0`.
   - The conditions inside the loop body will be applied to `i = 0` and `ind = 0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `ind` is 0**
