Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in the following conditions:

- The variable `t` will hold the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is the final value after all iterations.
- The variable `comand` will contain the last command read from the standard input, split and stripped.
- The variable `obj` will be the first element of the last `comand`.
- The variable `com` will be the second element of the last `comand`.
- If the length of `comand` is 3, `el` will be the third element of the last `comand`.
- The variable `pos` will be the value of the element in the `elements` dictionary at the key `obj` after the last iteration.
- The variable `nxt` will be the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])` if `comand` has two elements and `obj` is not '.B'. If `obj` is '.B' and the next position is occupied by a player, `nxt` will be the player's position. If `obj` is a player and the next position is occupied by '.B', `nxt` will be the position of '.B'.
- The variable `player` will be set to `obj` if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is also a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is where the black piece ('.B') is located. Otherwise, `player` will be `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if the next position `nxt` is valid.
- The dictionaries `allPlayers` and `points` will be updated according to the commands executed during the loop.
- The list `goal` will remain unchanged unless a goal is scored during the loop, in which case the corresponding team's score will be incremented by 1.
- The `elements` dictionary will be updated to reflect the new positions of the players and the black piece ('.B') after each iteration.
- The `grid` will remain unchanged unless a player moves to a new position or a player is eliminated, in which case the grid will reflect these changes.
