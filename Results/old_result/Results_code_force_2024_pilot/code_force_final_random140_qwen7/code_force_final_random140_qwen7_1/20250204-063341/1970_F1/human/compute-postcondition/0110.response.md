Output State: **`ind` is 1, `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

This means that the variable `goal[tmp]` has been updated to include the tuple `(i, ind)`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
