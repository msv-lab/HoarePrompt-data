Output State: **`i` is 1, `ind` is 2**.

Explanation: The given code snippet is `elements[line[ind]] = i, ind`. Here, `i` is currently 0, and `ind` is 1. Since `ind` is 1, `line[ind]` refers to the second element in the list `line` (as list indices start from 0). The line `elements[line[ind]] = i, ind` assigns the tuple `(i, ind)` to the element `line[ind]` in the `elements` dictionary. Given that `i` is 0 initially, after executing this line, `i` will be incremented by 1 (since `i` is updated in the next iteration), making it 1. Also, `ind` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, the updated states are `i` is 1 and `ind` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition.
