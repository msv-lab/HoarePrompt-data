Postcondition: `time` is incremented by 1, `comand` is a list of strings, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`, `team` is the result of calling `goalIn(pos)`, and if `team` is not `-1`, `points[team]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
