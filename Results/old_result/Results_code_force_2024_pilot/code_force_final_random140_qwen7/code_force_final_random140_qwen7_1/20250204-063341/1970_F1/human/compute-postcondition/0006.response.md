Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state.
   - `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should start from 0 and increment until it reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is not initialized, it should be set to 0 initially.
   - `n` must be an odd integer between 3 and 99 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99**
