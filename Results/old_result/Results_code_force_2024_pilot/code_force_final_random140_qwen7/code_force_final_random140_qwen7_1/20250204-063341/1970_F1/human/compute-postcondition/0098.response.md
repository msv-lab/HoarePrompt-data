Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `ind` and the expression `range(len(line))`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ind`**: The variable `ind` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `len(line)`. Therefore, the length of `line` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **List the variables that need adjustment**: The variables that need adjustment are `ind` and `line`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `ind` should be set to 0.
   - `line` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`ind` is 0, `line` must have at least one element**
