Output State: **`time` is incremented by 1, `comand` is a list of strings, `obj` is an element from the list `comand`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else 0; `points[team]` is increased by 10.**

Explanation: The code increments the points for the team identified by the `obj` variable. If the first character of `obj` is 'B', `team` is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0. The `points` dictionary's value for the corresponding `team` is then increased by 10. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
