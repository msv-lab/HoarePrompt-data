Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true or `isPlayer(obj)` is true and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then `obj` remains unchanged and `com` is not equal to 'T'. Otherwise, if `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, `isPlayer(obj)` is true, and `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`, then if `com` is 'T', `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1; otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` and `com` is not equal to 'T'.
