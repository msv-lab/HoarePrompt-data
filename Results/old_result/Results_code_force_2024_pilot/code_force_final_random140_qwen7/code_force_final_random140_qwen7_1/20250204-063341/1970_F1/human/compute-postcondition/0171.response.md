Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **team**: This is the result of `goalIn(pos)`. Without knowing the exact function `goalIn(pos)`, we can't determine the exact value of `team`. However, it will be a string representing the team that scored the goal.

2. **time**: This is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we'll assume it's a variable that holds some value, likely an integer representing the time of the event.

3. **GoalName**: This is a dictionary that maps teams to their names. Since `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `GoalName[team]` will give us the name of the team that scored the goal.

4. **The print statement**: 
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

Given the information, we know:
- `time` is some integer value.
- `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, which means it's a key in the `GoalName` dictionary.
- `GoalName[team]` gives the name of the team that scored the goal.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string in the format `<time> <team_name> GOAL`, where `<time>` is the value of the `time` variable and `<team_name>` is the name of the team that scored the goal.

Output: **%d [team_name] GOAL (where [team_name] is the name of the team that scored the goal and %d is the value of the time variable)**
