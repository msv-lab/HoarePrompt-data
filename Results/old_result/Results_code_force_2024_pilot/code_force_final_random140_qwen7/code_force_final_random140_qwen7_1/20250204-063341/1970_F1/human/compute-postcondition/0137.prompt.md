Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{' .B': (0, 0)}`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list containing `[0, 0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the `line` list (which is also the length of the single element in the `grid` list). The value of `ind` will be `n-1` as well, since the loop iterates over the indices of `line` starting from 0 until `n-1`. For each index `ind` where `line[ind] != '..'`, the following conditions hold: `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is set to 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else 1, and the list `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `ind` will be equal to the length of `line`, `elements` will contain key-value pairs for each non-`'..'` element in `line`, where the key is the element from `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, index)` indicating the iteration number `i` and the index `index` in `line`. The dictionary `allPlayers` will be updated for any player elements in `line`, setting `allPlayers[element]` to `False`. The list `goal` will contain tuples `(i, index)` for each goal element in `line` that belongs to a player, with `tmp` determining which list in `goal` to append to based on the first character of the goal element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `line` have been processed, meaning `ind` is equal to `len(line) - 1`. The `elements` dictionary contains key-value pairs where each non-empty cell in `line` maps to a tuple `(i, ind)`. If a cell in `line` represents a player, `allPlayers` dictionary marks it as `False`. For cells representing goals ('BG' or 'RG'), `goal` list corresponding to the team (0 or 1) will contain tuples `(i, ind)` indicating the position of the goal.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
