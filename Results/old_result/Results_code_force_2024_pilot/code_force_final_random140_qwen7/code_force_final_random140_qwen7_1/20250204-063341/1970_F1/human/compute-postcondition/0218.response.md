Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`. If the length of `command` is 3, `el` is the third element of `command`. 

- If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`.
- If `el` is '.', `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else 0; `points[team]` is increased by 10.
- If the length of `command` is not 3, `player` is set to `obj` if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is also a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is where the black piece ('.B') is located, otherwise `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]` and `pos` is set to `nxt` if the goal is reached from the current position `pos` or the player at `obj` is valid, and `elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`.
