Output State: **`obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the first element of `command`, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `points[team]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the points of the team whose goal was scored (determined by the `goalIn(pos)` function). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
