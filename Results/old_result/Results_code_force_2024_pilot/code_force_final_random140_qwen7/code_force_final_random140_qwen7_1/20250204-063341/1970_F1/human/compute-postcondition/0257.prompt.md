You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string contains pairs of characters. elements is a dictionary mapping each entity (player, goal, Quaffle) to its position on the grid. allPlayers is a dictionary indicating whether a player is carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of lists, where each sublist contains the positions of the goals for each team. points is a list of integers representing the current scores for the red and blue teams. mov is a dictionary mapping each direction (U, D, L, R) to its corresponding movement vector. t is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {'.B': (0, 0)}
    allPlayers = {}
    goal = [[], []]
    points = [0, 0]
    for i in range(n):
        line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        
        grid.append(line)
        
        for ind in range(len(line)):
            if line[ind] != '..':
                elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
                if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                    allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
                elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                    tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                    goal[tmp].append((i, ind))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the `line` list (which is also the length of the single element in the `grid` list). The value of `ind` will be `n-1` as well, since the loop iterates over the indices of `line` starting from 0 until `n-1`. For each index `ind` where `line[ind] != '..'`, the following conditions hold: `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is set to 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else 1, and the list `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`. The `grid` list will contain `n` lines, each line being a list of strings read from standard input. The `elements` dictionary will map each non-empty cell in the grid to its coordinates, the `allPlayers` dictionary will mark players as `False`, and the `goal` list will contain positions of goals for each team.

    #State: Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in the following conditions:
    #
    #- The variable `t` will hold the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is the final value after all iterations.
    #- The variable `comand` will contain the last command read from the standard input, split and stripped.
    #- The variable `obj` will be the first element of the last `comand`.
    #- The variable `com` will be the second element of the last `comand`.
    #- If the length of `comand` is 3, `el` will be the third element of the last `comand`.
    #- The variable `pos` will be the value of the element in the `elements` dictionary at the key `obj` after the last iteration.
    #- The variable `nxt` will be the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])` if `comand` has two elements and `obj` is not '.B'. If `obj` is '.B' and the next position is occupied by a player, `nxt` will be the player's position. If `obj` is a player and the next position is occupied by '.B', `nxt` will be the position of '.B'.
    #- The variable `player` will be set to `obj` if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is also a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is where the black piece ('.B') is located. Otherwise, `player` will be `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if the next position `nxt` is valid.
    #- The dictionaries `allPlayers` and `points` will be updated according to the commands executed during the loop.
    #- The list `goal` will remain unchanged unless a goal is scored during the loop, in which case the corresponding team's score will be incremented by 1.
    #- The `elements` dictionary will be updated to reflect the new positions of the players and the black piece ('.B') after each iteration.
    #- The `grid` will remain unchanged unless a player moves to a new position or a player is eliminated, in which case the grid will reflect these changes.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n and m, which are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. It also accepts a 2D list of strings representing the field, a dictionary mapping entities to their positions, a dictionary indicating whether a player is carrying the Quaffle, a list of lists containing goal positions, a list of integers representing scores, and a dictionary mapping directions to movement vectors. Additionally, it accepts a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game. The function does not return anything.
