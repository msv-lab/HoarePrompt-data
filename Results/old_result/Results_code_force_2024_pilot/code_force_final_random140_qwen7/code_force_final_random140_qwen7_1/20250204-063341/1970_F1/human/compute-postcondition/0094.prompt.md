Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0; `ind` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of input (stdin), stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split by spaces; `grid` is a list containing one list which is equal to `line`.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ind` is either 0 or 1, `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is either assigned the value `i` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True` and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`) or not assigned the value `i` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`). If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True` and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple `(i, 1)`. Otherwise, these conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 2, `elements[line[1]]` is either assigned the value `i` or not assigned the value `i`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` returns `True` and `line[1][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple `(i, 1)`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is either 4 or 5, `elements[line[1]]` is assigned the value `i`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0]` equals 'B' else 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains an additional element `(i, 5)` if `ind` is 5. `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, and `tmp` and `goal` retain their previous values if `ind` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
