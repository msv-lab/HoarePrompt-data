Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of standard input after stripping and splitting it, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the `line` list to the `grid` list. Since `line` is already defined as a list of strings obtained from the first line of standard input, appending it to `grid` simply adds this list as the first element of `grid`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
