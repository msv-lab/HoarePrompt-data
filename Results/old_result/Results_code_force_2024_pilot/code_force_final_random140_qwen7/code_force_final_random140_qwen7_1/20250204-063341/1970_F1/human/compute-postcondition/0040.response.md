Output State: **`i` is 1, `ind` is 3, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False**

Explanation: The code sets `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. Given the initial state, `ind` is 3, so `line[ind]` is `line[3]`, which means `allPlayers[line[3]]` is set to `False`. The values of `i` and `ind` remain unchanged.
