Based on the initial state described, let's break down the variables and their values:

1. **t**: This holds the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is the final value after all iterations.
2. **comand**: This contains the last command read from the standard input, split and stripped.
3. **obj**: This is the first element of the last `comand`.
4. **com**: This is the second element of the last `comand`.
5. **el**: If the length of `comand` is 3, this is the third element of the last `comand`.
6. **pos**: This is the value of the element in the `elements` dictionary at the key `obj` after the last iteration.
7. **nxt**: This is calculated based on the movement rules:
   - If `comand` has two elements and `obj` is not '.B', `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - If `obj` is '.B' and the next position is occupied by a player, `nxt` is the player's position.
   - If `obj` is a player and the next position is occupied by '.B', `nxt` is the position of '.B'.
8. **player**: This is set based on the following conditions:
   - If `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is also a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is where the black piece ('.B') is located, then `player` is `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if the next position `nxt` is valid.
9. **allPlayers**: This dictionary is updated according to the commands executed during the loop.
10. **points**: This dictionary keeps track of the scores for both teams.
11. **goal**: This list remains unchanged unless a goal is scored during the loop, in which case the corresponding team's score will be incremented by 1.
12. **elements**: This dictionary is updated to reflect the new positions of the players and the black piece ('.B') after each iteration.
13. **grid**: This remains unchanged unless a player moves to a new position or a player is eliminated, in which case the grid will reflect these changes.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

This will print the final scores of the two teams. Since the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are determined by the commands executed during the loop, and no specific values are provided, we can only refer to them as the values they hold after all iterations.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]]**
