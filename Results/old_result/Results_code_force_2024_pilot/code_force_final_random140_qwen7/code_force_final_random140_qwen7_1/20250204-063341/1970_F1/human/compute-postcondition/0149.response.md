Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `obj` is the first string from the command list, `com` is the second string from the command list, `el` is '.S', `team` is 0 if `obj[0]` is not 'B', else `team` is 1; points[team] is increased by 10.**

This means that the value of `points[team]` has been increased by 10, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `team` depends on whether `obj[0]` is 'B' or not, but this does not change the fact that `points[team]` has been incremented.
