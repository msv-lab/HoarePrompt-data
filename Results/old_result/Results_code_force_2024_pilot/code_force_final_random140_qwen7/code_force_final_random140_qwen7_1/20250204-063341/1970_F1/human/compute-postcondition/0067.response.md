Postcondition: `ind` is 1, `line` must have at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the value `i`, and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`. If the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple `(i, 1)`. Otherwise, these conditions remain unchanged.
