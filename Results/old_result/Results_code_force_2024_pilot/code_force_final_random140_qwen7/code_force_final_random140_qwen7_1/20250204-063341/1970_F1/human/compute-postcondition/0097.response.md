Output State: **`grid` now contains the list `line`, while `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `tmp`, and `i` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code `grid.append(line)` adds the list `line` to the end of the `grid` list. No other variables (`elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `tmp`, `i`) are affected by this operation, so they retain their original values. The `line` list itself is unchanged.
