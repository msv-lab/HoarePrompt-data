pos is a string representing a position on the field, where the field is described as a grid with N rows and M columns, and each position can be either empty (..), a player (R0-R9 or B0-B9), a goal (RG or BG), or the Quaffle (.Q). The function `goalIn` determines whether the given position is a goal for the red team (returning 0), the blue team (returning 1), or neither (returning -1).
