Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `comand` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True else `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`**.

This means that the variable `player` has been updated based on the condition given. If `obj` is a player, then `player` is set to `obj`; otherwise, `player` is set to the cell in the `grid` at the position `nxt`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
