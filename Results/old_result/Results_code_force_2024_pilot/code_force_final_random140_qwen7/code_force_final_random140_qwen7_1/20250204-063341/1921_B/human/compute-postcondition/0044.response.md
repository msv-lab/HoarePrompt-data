Output State: **`b` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `b += s[i] < t[i]` increments `b` by 1 if the condition `s[i] < t[i]` is true, otherwise `b` remains unchanged. Since the initial state only mentions the condition for `a`, and no specific values or conditions for `s[i]` and `t[i]` are given, the output state focuses on the impact on `b`.
