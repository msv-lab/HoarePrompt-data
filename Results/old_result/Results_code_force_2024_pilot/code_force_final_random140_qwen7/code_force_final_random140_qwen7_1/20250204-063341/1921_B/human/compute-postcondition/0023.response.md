Output State: **`a` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is greater than `t[0]`, `b` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a += s[i] > t[i]` checks if the character at index `i` in string `s` is greater than the character at the same index in string `t` (using lexicographical order). If true, `a` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is 0 initially, `a` will be updated to 1 if `s[0] > t[0]`, otherwise, it remains 0. The values of `b`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
