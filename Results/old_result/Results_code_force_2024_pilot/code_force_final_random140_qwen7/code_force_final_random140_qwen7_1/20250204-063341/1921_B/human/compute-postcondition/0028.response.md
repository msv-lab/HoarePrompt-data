Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `a` is 1 if `s[2]` is greater than `t[2]` else 0.
   - `b` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the problem does not specify any change in `n`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is determined by the values of `s[2]` and `t[2]`, which are not modified within the loop.
   - `b` remains 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` is incremented to 3.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is 1 if `s[2]` is greater than `t[2]` else 0, `b` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3**
