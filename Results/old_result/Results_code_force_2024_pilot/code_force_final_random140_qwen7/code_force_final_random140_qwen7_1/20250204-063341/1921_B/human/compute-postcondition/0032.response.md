Output State: `a` will be the count of how many times `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `b` will be the count of how many times `s[i]` is less than `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `n` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed, `i` will be `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will hold the total number of indices where the value in list `s` is greater than the corresponding value in list `t`, `b` will hold the total number of indices where the value in list `s` is less than the corresponding value in list `t`, `n` will be the length of the lists `s` and `t`, and `i` will be equal to `n`.
