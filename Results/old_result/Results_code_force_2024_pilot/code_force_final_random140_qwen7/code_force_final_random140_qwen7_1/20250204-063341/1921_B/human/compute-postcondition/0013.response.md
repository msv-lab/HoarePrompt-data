Output State: **`b` is either the same or incremented by the boolean value of `s[i] < t[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is greater than the character at index `i` of `t`, otherwise `a` remains the same.**

This means that `b` will be incremented by 1 if the condition `s[i] < t[i]` is true, otherwise it will remain the same. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `a` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is greater than the character at index `i` of `t`, otherwise `a` remains the same.
