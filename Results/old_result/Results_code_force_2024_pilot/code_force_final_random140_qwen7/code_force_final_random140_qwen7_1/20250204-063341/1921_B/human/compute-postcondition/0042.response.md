Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `b` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.
- The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- `i`: The loop variable.
- `n`: The upper limit of the loop.

### Adjusting States
- **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop.

### Determining the New State
- Since `b` is updated based on the condition `s[i] < t[i]`, the value of `b` itself does not change during the loop iteration unless the condition is met. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to explicitly mention `b` unless it changes.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.

If we assume the initial value of `i` was `k` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), then:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize the answer as follows:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.

This means that `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.
