Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it compares the initial state (`s`) and the desired state (`f`) of a sequence of boxes represented by binary strings. It calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state. Each operation can flip the state of any box. The function outputs the result for each test case.**
