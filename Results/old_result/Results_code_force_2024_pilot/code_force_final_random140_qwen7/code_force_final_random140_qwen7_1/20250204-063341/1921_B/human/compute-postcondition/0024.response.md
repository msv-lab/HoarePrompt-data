Output State: **`a` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is greater than `t[0]`, `b` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `b += s[i] < t[i]` checks if the element at index `i` in list `s` is less than the element at the same index in list `t`. Since `i` is initially 0, it compares `s[0]` with `t[0]`. If `s[0]` is less than `t[0]`, `b` is incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1). The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was determined by the comparison of `s[0]` and `t[0]` before the code execution. The value of `n` and `i` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
