Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 0, `n` is an input integer plus 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `t` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes `a` and `b` to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `a` and `b` are set to 0, while `n`, `i`, and `t` retain their original values.
