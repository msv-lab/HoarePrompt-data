Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is the count of indices where the character in the new string `s` is greater than the corresponding character in `t`, and `b` is the count of indices where the character in the new string `s` is less than the corresponding character in `t`; `t` is a newly input string.**

Explanation: The code `t = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input is a string. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
