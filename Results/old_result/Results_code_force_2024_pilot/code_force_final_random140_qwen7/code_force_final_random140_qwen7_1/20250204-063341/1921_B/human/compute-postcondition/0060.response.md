Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n - 1`
   - `n` must be a positive integer
   - `hd` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `n - 1`, and `n` itself is not modified within the loop.

5. **New state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously less than `n - 1`, it will now be equal to the current value of `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is less than `n - 1`, `n` must be a positive integer**
