Output State: **`a` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, otherwise `a` remains the same.**

This means that the value of `a` is updated by adding 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is lexicographically greater than the character at the same index in string `t`. Otherwise, `a` retains its previous value.
