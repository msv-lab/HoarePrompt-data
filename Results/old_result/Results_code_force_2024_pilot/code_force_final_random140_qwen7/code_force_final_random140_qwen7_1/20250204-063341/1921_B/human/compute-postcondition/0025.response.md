Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is greater than `t[0]`.
   - `b` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `a` remains the same (0 or 1).
   - `b` remains 1.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).
   - `i` is now 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is greater than `t[0]`, `b` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**
