Output State: **`T` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code sets `ans` to 0. This initializes `ans` to zero without changing the values of `T`, `n`, `m`, `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]`, and `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values and relationships as described in the initial state.
