### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure clarity:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Original Program Analysis:**
   - The original program attempts to count the number of valid pairs by iterating over \(b\) from 1 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adding \(n // b + 1\) to the answer. This logic does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly.
   - The provided corrected program uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the greatest common divisor and checks the condition for each pair \((a, b)\).

4. **Verification of Corrected Program:**
   - The corrected program iterates over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checks if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). If it is, it increments the counter.
   - This ensures that all valid pairs are counted accurately.

Given the detailed analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the required logic, as it fails to check the condition for each pair \((a, b)\) and instead uses an incorrect heuristic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.
