Output State: **`T` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `b` is 2, `ans` is `n // b + 2`**

Explanation: The initial value of `ans` was `n // b + 1`. After executing the line `ans = ans + n // b + 1`, `ans` is updated to its original value plus `n // b + 1`. Since `b` is 2, `n // b` is equivalent to `n // 2`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `(n // 2 + 1) + (n // 2 + 1)`, which simplifies to `n // 2 + n // 2 + 2` or `n // b + 2`. The values of `T`, `n`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged.
