Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` as `ans + n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This calculation does not account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` and ensure that the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is met for each pair `(a, b)`. The current implementation does not include this critical check.
