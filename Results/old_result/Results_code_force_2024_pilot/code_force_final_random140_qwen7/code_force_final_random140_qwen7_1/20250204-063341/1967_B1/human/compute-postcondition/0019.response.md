Output State: **`T` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `b` is 1, `ans` is `n // b + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. Given that `b` is 1, `n // b` simplifies to `n`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `n + 1`. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `m`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
