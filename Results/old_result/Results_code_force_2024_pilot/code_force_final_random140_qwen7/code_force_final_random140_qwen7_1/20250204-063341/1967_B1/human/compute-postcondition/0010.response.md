Output State: **`ans` is `ans + n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1 + n // (min(n, m) + 2) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 2`**

Explanation: The first line of code updates `ans` to `ans + n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1`. The second line updates `ans` again to `ans + n // b + 1`, where `b` is defined as `min(n, m) + 2`. Therefore, the final value of `ans` includes both parts of the updates. The value of `b` remains unchanged from its initial definition.
