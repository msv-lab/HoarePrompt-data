Output State: **`T` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers. The variable `T` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 1. After the conversion, `n` and `m` now hold their respective integer values from the input.
