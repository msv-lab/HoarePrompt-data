Output State: `T` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`.

To understand this, let's break it down:
- The loop runs for each value of `b` starting from 1 up to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
- For each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value.
- After all iterations, `b` will be equal to `min(n, m) + 1` because the loop increments `b` until it reaches this value.
- `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.
