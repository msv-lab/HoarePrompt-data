### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement step-by-step.

#### Problem Statement:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\) as strings, converts them to integers, and initializes `ans` to 0.
- It then iterates over values of \(b\) from 1 to \(\min(n, m)\) and updates `ans` by adding \(n // b + 1\) to it.
- Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop runs from \(b = 1\) to \(b = \min(n, m)\).
   - The expression `n // b + 1` is added to `ans` in each iteration.

2. **Expression `n // b + 1`**:
   - This expression does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it simply counts how many times \(b\) divides into \(n\), which is not relevant to the problem's constraints.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation does not perform this check and hence is incorrect.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case \((n, m) = (10, 8)\):
- Valid pairs should be: \((1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 4)\).
- There are 16 valid pairs, but the program outputs 14, indicating it is missing some valid pairs.

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and instead uses a different and incorrect approach.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
