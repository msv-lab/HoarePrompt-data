Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `b` and the expression `min(n, m) + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `b` is within the range from `1` to `min(n, m) + 1`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `b`**: Initially, `b` is set to `min(n, m) + 1`. For the loop to start executing, `b` must be within the range `1` to `min(n, m) + 1`. Since `b` is initially set to `min(n, m) + 1`, the loop will not execute because `b` is equal to the upper bound of the range.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop executes, `b` must be less than `min(n, m) + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the initial value of `b` to be `1` or any value less than `min(n, m) + 1`.

5. **Adjust other relevant states**: We also need to ensure that `n` and `m` are integers and that `min(n, m)` is correctly computed. However, since the loop condition depends on `b`, the states of `n` and `m` do not need to be explicitly adjusted unless they affect the computation of `min(n, m)`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `b` should be `1` (or any value less than `min(n, m) + 1`).
- `n` and `m` should be integers, but their specific values do not need to be adjusted as long as they are valid integers.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `T` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]`, `b` is 1, `ans` is 0**
