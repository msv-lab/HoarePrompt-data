The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \( n // b + 1 \) for every integer \( b \) ranging from 1 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \), inclusive. The function prints the result for each test case.
