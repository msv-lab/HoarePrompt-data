Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read and split into separate integers.

2. **Calculating the Answer:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
   - A loop runs from `b = 1` to `min(n, m)`.
   - Inside the loop, `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1`.

### Checking the Logic

#### Key Points to Verify:
- **Condition Verification:** The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be checked.
- **Calculation of `ans`:** The current logic does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Current Logic:**
   - The current logic counts the number of multiples of `b` within the range `[1, n]` and adds 1 (to include `b` itself).
   - This approach does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - For each valid pair \((a, b)\), we should increment the counter.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Verification

- The corrected program iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition.
- It correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
