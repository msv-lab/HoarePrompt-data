Output State: The value of `ans` will be the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive. The final value of `ans` is the cumulative sum of these terms for all iterations of the loop.

In more detail, `ans` will be incremented by `n // b + 1` for each integer `b` starting from 1 up to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This means `ans` will accumulate the sum of `n // b + 1` for every `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, where `b` increases by 1 with each iteration of the loop.
