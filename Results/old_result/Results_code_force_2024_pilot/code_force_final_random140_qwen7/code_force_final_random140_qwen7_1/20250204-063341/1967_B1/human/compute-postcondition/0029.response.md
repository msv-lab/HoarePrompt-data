Output State: **`T` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`**.

Explanation: The line `n, m = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers. However, since `n` and `m` are already treated as input integers in the initial state, this line does not change their nature. The values of `T`, `n`, `m`, `b`, and `ans` remain as they were, with `b` being `min(n, m) + 1` and `ans` being the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)`.
