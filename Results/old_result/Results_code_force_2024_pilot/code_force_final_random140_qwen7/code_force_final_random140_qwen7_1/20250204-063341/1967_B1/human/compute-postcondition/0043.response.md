Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and the sum of all n and the sum of all m over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅10^6. The function returns a result based on the values of n and m for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers n and m, and returns a specific value or set of values based on the logic applied to n and m within each test case.
