Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `b`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated as `ans + n // b + 1`.
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 1`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `b < min(n, m)`.
   - Since `b` starts from 1 and increments by 1, at the end of the previous iteration, `b` would be equal to `min(n, m)`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented to `min(n, m) + 1`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is updated inside the loop but not directly modified outside.
   - `n` and `m` remain the same since they are not modified within the loop head.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `b` should be set to `min(n, m) + 1`.
- `n` and `m` remain the same.

Given the initial conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is `ans + n // b + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m) >= 1`, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m) >= 1**
