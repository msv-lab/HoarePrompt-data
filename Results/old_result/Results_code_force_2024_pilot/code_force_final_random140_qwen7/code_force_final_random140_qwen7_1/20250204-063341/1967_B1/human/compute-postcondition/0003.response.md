Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `[n, m]` is a list containing two integers converted from the original strings.**

Explanation: The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers and assigns them back to the list `[n, m]`. The initial conditions that `t` must be greater than 0 and `T` is 0 remain unchanged.
