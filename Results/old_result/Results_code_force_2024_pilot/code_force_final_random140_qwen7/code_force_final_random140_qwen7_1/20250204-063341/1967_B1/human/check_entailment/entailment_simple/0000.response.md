Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The key issue lies in the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b). Specifically, the program incorrectly increments `ans` by `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. This approach does not account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:
- For the test case (n=2, m=3):
  - The pairs (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2) should be checked.
  - According to the problem statement, we need to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's manually verify the pairs:
- (1,1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1,1) = 1\). Since \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- (1,2): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1,2) = 2\). Since \(3\) is not a multiple of \(2\), this pair is invalid.
- (1,3): \(1 + 3 = 4\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(1,3) = 3\). Since \(4\) is not a multiple of \(3\), this pair is invalid.
- (2,1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2,1) = 1\). Since \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- (2,2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2,2) = 2\). Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(2\), this pair is valid.

So, the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2), which totals to 3 valid pairs.

However, the provided program would incorrectly count these pairs because it does not properly check the condition \(a + b \mod (b * \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
