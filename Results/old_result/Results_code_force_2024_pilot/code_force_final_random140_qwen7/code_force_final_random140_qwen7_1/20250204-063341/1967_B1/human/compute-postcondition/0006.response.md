Output State: **`ans` is `ans + n // b + 1`, `n` is an integer such that min(`n`, `m`) is at least 1, `m` is an integer such that min(`n`, `m`) is at least 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the condition that the minimum of `n` and `m` is at least 1 is preserved.
