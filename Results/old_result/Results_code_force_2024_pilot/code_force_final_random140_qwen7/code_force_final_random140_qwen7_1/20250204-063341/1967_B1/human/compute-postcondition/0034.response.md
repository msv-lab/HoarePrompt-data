Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`
   - `ans` is `ans + n // b + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `b` is within the range from `1` to `min(n, m) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1, making it `min(n, m) + 2`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since `b` is now `min(n, m) + 2`, the new state of `b` is `min(n, m) + 2`.
   - The value of `ans` remains the same as it was updated in the previous iteration but does not change until the next iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b` is `min(n, m) + 2`, `ans` is `ans + n // (min(n, m) + 1) + 1`**
