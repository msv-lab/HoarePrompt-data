Output State: **`b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `ans` is `ans + n // b + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `b` remains unchanged and is still equal to `min(n, m) + 1`. The variable `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. Since the exact value of `ans` before this operation is not specified, it is represented as `ans + n // b + 1`.
