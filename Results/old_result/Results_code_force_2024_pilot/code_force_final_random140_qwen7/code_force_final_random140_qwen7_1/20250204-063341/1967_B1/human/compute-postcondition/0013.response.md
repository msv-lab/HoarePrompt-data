Based on the initial state provided, the value of `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for every integer `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m)` inclusive. This means `ans` is calculated as:

\[ \text{ans} = (n // 1 + 1) + (n // 2 + 1) + \cdots + (n // \text{min}(n, m) + 1) \]

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the sum of these terms.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n // b + 1 for every integer b in the range from 1 to min(n, m) inclusive)**
