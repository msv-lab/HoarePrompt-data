Output State: **`count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `n` is the integer value of the input provided by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, and `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no'.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`count_ones`, `n`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
