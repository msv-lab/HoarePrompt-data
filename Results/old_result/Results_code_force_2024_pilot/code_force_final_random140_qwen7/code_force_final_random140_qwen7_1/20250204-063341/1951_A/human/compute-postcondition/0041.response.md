Output State: **`count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing 'yes' appended, and `count_ones` is updated to the count of '1's in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `count_ones`, `n`, or `arr`. The value of `count_ones` remains unchanged from its initial state as it is only updated elsewhere in the code (not shown in the snippet). Therefore, the only change is the addition of `'yes'` to the `results` list.
