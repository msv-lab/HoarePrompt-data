Output State: **`count_ones` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, and results is a list containing 'no'.**

The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Since `count_ones` was initially set to 2 and the substring `'11'` exists in `arr`, these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `n` and the string `arr` also remain as they were in the initial state. The only change is that `results` now contains the string `'no'`.
