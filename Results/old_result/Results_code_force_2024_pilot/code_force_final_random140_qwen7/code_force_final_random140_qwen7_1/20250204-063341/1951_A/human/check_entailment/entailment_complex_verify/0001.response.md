### Reasoning:

1. **Function Separation**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the `func()` function is standalone and unrelated to the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. This separation is crucial because the correctness of `func()` does not affect the evaluation of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`.

2. **Focus on `generate_files_for_html_in_range`**: The original assessment focuses on the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, which is appropriate given the problem description. The function's goal is to generate specific files in certain subdirectories based on a specified range.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - **Directory Listing and Filtering**: The function correctly uses `os.scandir()` to get the current directory and filter out only subdirectories that match the naming convention (i.e., are digits within the specified range).
   - **File Processing**: For each matching subdirectory, the function correctly lists all `.html` files.
   - **File Generation**: For each `.html` file, the function correctly generates two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) and prints the results.

4. **Annotations Validation**:
   - The annotated code provides a clear state transition and logic flow, which aligns with the original assessment.
   - Each step in the annotated code matches the intended behavior of the function.

5. **Edge Cases and Validity**: The function handles the edge cases where the directory names are digits and fall within the specified range. It also correctly processes the `.html` files and generates the required files.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately evaluates the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function based on its logic and behavior. The function performs all the necessary steps correctly and does not have any logical errors or omissions.

### Final:
**True**

The given program `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is correct based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.
