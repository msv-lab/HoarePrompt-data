Postcondition: **`count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no'. If `count_ones` is odd, `results` remains unchanged. If `count_ones` is even, 'yes' is appended to `results` if '11' is found in `arr`; otherwise, 'no' is appended to `results`. `count_ones` is updated to the count of '1's in `arr`.**
