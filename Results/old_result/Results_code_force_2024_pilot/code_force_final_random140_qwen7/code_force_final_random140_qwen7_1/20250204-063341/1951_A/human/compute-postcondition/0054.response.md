Output State: **`arr` is the input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` includes 'yes', and `count_ones` is updated to the number of '1's in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `count_ones`, `t`, or the updated value of `count_ones`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions except that `results` now includes `'yes'`.
