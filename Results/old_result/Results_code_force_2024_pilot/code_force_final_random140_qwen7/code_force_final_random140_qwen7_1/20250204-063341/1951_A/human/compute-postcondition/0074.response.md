Functionality: **The function reads multiple inputs consisting of integers and strings. For each input string, it counts the number of '1's. Based on the count and the presence of '11' in the string, it appends either 'yes' or 'no' to a list. After processing all inputs, it prints each element in the list. The function does not return any value.**
