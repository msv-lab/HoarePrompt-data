Output State: **`arr` is the input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` includes 'no', and `count_ones` is updated to the number of '1's in `arr`.**

This means that the `results` list now contains 'no', indicating that '11' was not found in `arr` when `count_ones` was even. All other variables remain in their previously described states.
