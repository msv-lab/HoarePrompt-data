Output State: **`count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `n` is the integer value of the input provided by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' with 'no' appended to it, and `count_ones` is updated to the count of '1's in `arr`.**

The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. The values of `count_ones`, `n`, `arr`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `'no'` is added to the `results` list.
