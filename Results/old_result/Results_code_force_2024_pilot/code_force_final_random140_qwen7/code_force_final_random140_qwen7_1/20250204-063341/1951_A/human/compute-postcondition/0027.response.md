Postcondition: `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, and `results` is a list containing 'no' or 'yes' depending on whether '11' is found in `arr`. If `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains 'no'. If `count_ones` is 2, `results` contains 'yes'. Otherwise, `count_ones` is less than 2, and `results` contains 'no'.
