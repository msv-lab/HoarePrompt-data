Postcondition: `arr` is the input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `t` is `t - 1`. If `count_ones` is 2, then `results` includes either 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether '11' is found in `arr` when `count_ones` is even, with `count_ones` being updated to the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is not 2, then `results` includes 'yes', and `count_ones` is updated to the number of '1's in `arr`.
