Postcondition: `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `n` is the integer value of the input provided by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', and if '11' is found in `arr`, 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended to `results`. `count_ones` is updated to the count of '1's in `arr`.
