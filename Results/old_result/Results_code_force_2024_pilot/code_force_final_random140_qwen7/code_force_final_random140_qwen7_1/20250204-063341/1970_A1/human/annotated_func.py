#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will have the following characteristics:
    #
    #`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
    #`i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
    #`char` is the last character of `s`.
    #`balance` will be 0 because for every opening parenthesis "(", there will be a corresponding closing parenthesis ")" that balances it out, making the net balance zero at the end of the loop.
    #`positions` is a list containing tuples, each representing the balance, index, and character at each step of the loop. The list will have exactly `n` tuples, with the last tuple being `(0, n-1, char)`.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the characters in the `positions` list, which includes the balance, index, and character at each step of the loop, ending with (0, n-1, char)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", counts the balance of parentheses at each position, records the balance, index, and character at each step, sorts these records by balance and index, and finally returns a string formed by joining the characters in the sorted records, ending with the record showing a balance of 0 at the last index.
