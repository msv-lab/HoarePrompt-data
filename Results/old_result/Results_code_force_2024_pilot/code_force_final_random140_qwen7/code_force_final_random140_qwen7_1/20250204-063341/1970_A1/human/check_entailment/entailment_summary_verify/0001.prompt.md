You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for (_, _, char) in positions])
    return result



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", counts the balance of parentheses at each position, records the balance, index, and character at each step, sorts these records by balance and index, and finally returns a string formed by joining the characters in the sorted records, ending with the record showing a balance of 0 at the last index.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty list `positions` to store tuples of `(balance, index, character)`.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate` to get both the index and the character.
     - If the character is '(', it increments the `balance`.
     - If the character is ')', it decrements the `balance`.
     - It appends a tuple containing the current `balance`, the current index, and the character to the `positions` list.
   - After processing all characters, it sorts the `positions` list based on the `balance` (ascending order) and the index (descending order).
   - It constructs the resulting string by extracting the characters from the sorted `positions` list and joins them into a single string.
   - Finally, it returns the constructed string.

3. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the correctness of the implementation with the provided example:
     - Input: `(()(()))`
     - Expected Output: `()(()())`

   - **Processing the Input:**
     - For the input string `(()(()))`, the balances at each position are:
       ```
       Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1
       Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9
       Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )|
       ```

   - **Sorting the Positions:**
     - Sorting the positions based on balance (ascending) and index (descending):
       ```
       Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
       Position| 1| 9| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
       Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )|
       ```

   - **Constructing the Result:**
     - The last row of the sorted table gives the characters in the shuffled order: `()(()())`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
