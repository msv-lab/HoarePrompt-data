Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s`, `balance` is 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise `balance` is decreased by 1; `positions` is a list containing a tuple `(balance, i, char)`**.

This means that the `positions` list now contains a tuple with the current values of `balance`, `i`, and `char`. The values of `s`, `i`, `char`, and `balance` remain as described in the initial state, except that `balance` is adjusted based on the value of `char`.
