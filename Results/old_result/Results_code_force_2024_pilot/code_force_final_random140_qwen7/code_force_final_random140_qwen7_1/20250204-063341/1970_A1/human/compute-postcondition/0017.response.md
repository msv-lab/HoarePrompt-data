Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `s`, `balance` is either the value of the second character of `s` plus 1 (if `char` is `(`) or `balance - 1` (if `char` is not `(`), `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)`, `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`, and a new tuple `(balance, i, char)` is appended to `positions`.**

This means that the `positions` list now includes the tuple representing the initial state and a new tuple with updated values for `balance`, `i`, and `char`.
