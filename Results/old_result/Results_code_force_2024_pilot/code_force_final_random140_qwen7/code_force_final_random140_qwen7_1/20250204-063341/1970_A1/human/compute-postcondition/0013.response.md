Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `s`, `balance` is the value of the second character of `s` plus 1, `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)` and `((value of the second character of s) + 1, 1, char)`**.

This means that the `balance` variable has been incremented by 1, and the `positions` list now contains two tuples: one with the original values and another with the updated `balance` value.
