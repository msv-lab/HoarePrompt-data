Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `char`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate(s)`.
   - The variable `i` is the index of the current character.
   - The variable `char` is the current character being processed.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `char` is the first character of `s`.
   - `balance` is 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise it is decreased by 1.
   - `positions` is a list containing a tuple `(balance, i, char)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the next character to process will be at index `1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be updated to `1`.
   - `char` will be the second character of the string `s`.

5. **Update the balance based on the new character**:
   - The balance will be updated according to the rules given: if the new `char` is '(', `balance` increases by 1; otherwise, it decreases by 1.

6. **Update the positions list**:
   - A new tuple `(balance, i, char)` will be added to the `positions` list.

Given this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be updated to `1`.
- `char` will be the second character of the string `s`.
- `balance` will be updated based on the second character.
- `positions` will include the new tuple `(balance, 1, char)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `s`, `balance` is updated based on the second character, `positions` is a list containing tuples `(balance, i, char)` including the new tuple `(balance, 1, char)`**.
