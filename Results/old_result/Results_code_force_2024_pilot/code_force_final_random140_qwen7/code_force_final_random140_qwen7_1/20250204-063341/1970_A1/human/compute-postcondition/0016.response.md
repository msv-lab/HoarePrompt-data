Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `s`, `balance` is either the value of the second character of `s` plus 1 (if `char` is `(`) or `balance - 1` (if `char` is not `(`), and `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)` and `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`.
