Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s`, and `balance` is decreased by 1.**

The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since `balance` was not specified with an initial value in the initial state, we can only say that it has been decreased by 1 without knowing its exact initial value. All other variables (`s`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged.
