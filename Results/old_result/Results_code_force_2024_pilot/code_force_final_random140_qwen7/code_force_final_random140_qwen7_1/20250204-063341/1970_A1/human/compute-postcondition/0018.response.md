Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `char` is the second character of `s`.
   - `balance` is either the value of the second character of `s` plus 1 (if `char` is `(`) or `balance - 1` (if `char` is not `(`).
   - `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)`, `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`, and a new tuple `(balance, i, char)` is appended to `positions`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.
   - The variable `char` is the character at the current index `i` in the string `s`.
   - The `balance` is updated based on the current character `char`.
   - The `positions` list is updated with a new tuple `(balance, i, char)`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `char` is the second character of `s`.
   - `balance` is either `ord(char) + 1` if `char == '('` or `balance - 1` otherwise.
   - `positions` contains `(1, 0, char)`, `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`, and a new tuple `(balance, i, char)`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
   - `char` will be the third character of `s`.
   - `balance` will be updated based on the new `char`.
   - A new tuple `(balance, i, char)` will be appended to `positions`.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `char` will be the third character of `s`.
   - `balance` will be updated accordingly.
   - `positions` will contain the new tuple `(balance, 2, char)`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `s`, `balance` is either the value of the third character of `s` plus 1 (if `char` is `(`) or `balance - 1` (if `char` is not `(`), `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)`, `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`, and a new tuple `(balance, 2, char)` is appended to `positions`.**
