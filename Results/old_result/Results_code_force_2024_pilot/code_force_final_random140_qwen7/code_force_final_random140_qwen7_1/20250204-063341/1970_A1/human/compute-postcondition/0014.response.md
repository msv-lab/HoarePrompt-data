Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `s`, `balance` is `balance - 1`, `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)` and `((balance - 1), 1, char)`**.

This means that the value of `balance` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
