Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `s`, `balance` is the value of the third character of `s` (since `balance -= 1` was applied to the previous value of `balance` which was `char + 1` if `char` was `(` or `balance - 1` if `char` was not `(`), `positions` is a list containing tuples `(1, 0, char)`, `((value of balance calculation), 1, char)`, and a new tuple `(balance - 1, 2, char)` is appended to `positions`.**

This means that the value of `balance` has been decreased by 1 from its previous state, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
