The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string formed by joining the characters in the `positions` list, which includes the balance, index, and character at each step of the loop, ending with (0, n-1, char).
