Reasoning:
1. The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. It calculates the balance of parentheses at each position in the input string.
3. It stores these values along with their indices and characters in a list.
4. It sorts this list according to the specified criteria (first by balance, then by index in descending order).
5. Finally, it constructs the balanced shuffle by joining the characters from the sorted list.

Given the detailed explanation and the step-by-step breakdown of the code, the implementation matches the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
