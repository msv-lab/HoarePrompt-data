Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `i` is equal to `n-1`; `char` is the last character of `s`; `balance` is 0; `positions` is a sorted list of tuples, each representing the balance, index, and character at each step of the loop, with the last tuple being `(0, n-1, char)`**.

Explanation: The code sorts the `positions` list based on the balance value first and then by the negative index. Since the balance is zero at the end and the last tuple is `(0, n-1, char)`, the sorting does not change the order of the list because the balance is already zero for all tuples. Therefore, the `positions` list remains as it was before sorting, but now it is sorted according to the specified key.
