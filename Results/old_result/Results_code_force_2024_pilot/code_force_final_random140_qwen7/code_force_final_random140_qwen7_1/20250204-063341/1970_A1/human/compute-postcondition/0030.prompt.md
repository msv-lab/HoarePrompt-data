You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will have the following characteristics:
    #
    #`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
    #`i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
    #`char` is the last character of `s`.
    #`balance` will be 0 because for every opening parenthesis "(", there will be a corresponding closing parenthesis ")" that balances it out, making the net balance zero at the end of the loop.
    #`positions` is a list containing tuples, each representing the balance, index, and character at each step of the loop. The list will have exactly `n` tuples, with the last tuple being `(0, n-1, char)`.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the characters in the `positions` list, which includes the balance, index, and character at each step of the loop, ending with (0, n-1, char)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")`, and returns a string formed by the balance, index, and character at each step of the loop, ending with (0, n-1, char).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string formed by joining the characters in the `positions` list, which includes the balance, index, and character at each step of the loop, ending with (0, n-1, char)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
