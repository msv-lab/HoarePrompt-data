Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `k`, or `p`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged, and `p` retains its value as the return value from `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
