Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 2
   - `k` is a positive integer
   - The postcondition states that if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the loop. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: 
   - Since `j` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `3`.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k + 1`.
   - Given that `j` is currently `2`, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `k + 1`. This means `k + 1` must be greater than `2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented to `3`.
   - `k` remains a positive integer.
   - The postcondition remains unchanged unless `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, but since no such information is provided, we assume it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, and the postcondition remains unchanged (if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the loop; otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged)**.
