Output State: **`j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**.

Explanation: The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` to be the return value of the function `func_1` called with arguments `(p + 1, m)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
