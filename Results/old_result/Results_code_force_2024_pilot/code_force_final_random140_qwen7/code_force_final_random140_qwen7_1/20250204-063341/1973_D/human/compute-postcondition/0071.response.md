Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n // k` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order. This means `i` starts at `n // k` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is `k`.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - The loop has executed `k` times.
   - `p` is not equal to `n`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop has executed `k` times, `i` must have started at `n // k` and decreased by 1 each time. Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n // k - k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `n // k - k` (one less than its current value).
   - The value of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` remains `k`.
   - `k` remains a positive integer.
   - `p` remains the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - `i` is now `n // k - k`.

Given these steps, the updated state is:

State: **`j` is `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - k`**
