### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Purpose:**
   - `func_1(l, x)` is used to query the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \).
   - `func_2(m)` is used to submit the answer \( m \).
   - `func_3()` is the main logic function that tries to find the largest \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays with the required property.
   - `func_4()` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_3()` for each test case.

2. **Logic in `func_3`:**
   - The function starts by determining the maximum value \( \max_val \) such that \( f(1, \max_val) \leq \max_val \cdot n \). This is done by querying for increasing values starting from \( n \) down to 1.
   - Once \( \max_val \) is found, the function attempts to find the largest \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has the same product of length and maximum value.
   - It does this by iterating over possible values of \( i \) (from \( n/k \) down to 1) and calculating \( m = i \cdot \max_val \). For each \( m \), it checks if the subarray from \( p+1 \) to \( n \) has the required property. If it finds such an \( m \), it submits it using `func_2(m)` and returns.
   - If no such \( m \) is found, it submits -1 using `func_2(-1)`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function ensures that all queries are valid and within the constraints.
   - The logic correctly handles the case where no valid \( m \) can be found.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function correctly processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_3()` until all test cases are handled.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the largest \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays with the required property. The code adheres to the problem constraints and handles all necessary cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
