Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, and if `p >= n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will take the final value of `k` since the loop runs from `1` to `k`. The other variables (`i`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body. The loop breaks if `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` at any point during the iterations, but since we are considering the state after all iterations, we assume no such break occurred.
