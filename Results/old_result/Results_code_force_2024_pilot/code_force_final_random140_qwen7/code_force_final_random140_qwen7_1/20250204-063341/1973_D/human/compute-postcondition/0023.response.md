Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `m` is assigned the value of `i * max_val`. Since `max_val` is 0, the value of `m` becomes 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `r`, and `max_val` remain unchanged.
