Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 2
   - `k` is a positive integer
   - `i` is `n // k`
   - `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`
   - `max_val` is 0
   - `m` is 0
   - The loop condition is `for j in range(1, k + 1)`.

2. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`.

3. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `j`, we need to increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `j` will be incremented from 2 to 3.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `k`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, and `m` are not directly affected by the loop and remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `j` should be updated to 3.
- All other variables (`k`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`) remain the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0**
