Output State: **j is k, p is the return value of func_1(k * (p + 1), m), k is a positive integer, and the current value of p is unchanged, and func_2(m) has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_2(m)` calls the function `func_2` with the argument `m`. However, since no return value from `func_2(m)` is assigned to any variable, the values of `j`, `k`, `p`, and `m` remain unchanged. The function call itself does not alter the values of these variables.
