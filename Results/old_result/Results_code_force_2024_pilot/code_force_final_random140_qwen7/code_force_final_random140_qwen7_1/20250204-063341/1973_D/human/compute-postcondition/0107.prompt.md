Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `n` remains as the initial positive integer value. The variable `i` is now 1 because the loop decremented `i` from `n` to 1. The variable `max_val` is set to the highest value of `i` that satisfied the condition `r <= n` during any iteration of the loop. The variable `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (i-1) * n)` which, when `i` reaches 1, would be `func_1(1, 0)`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    m = i * max_val
    p = 0
    for j in range(1, k + 1):
        if p >= n:
            p = 0
            break
        p = func_1(p + 1, m)
    if p == n:
        func_2(m)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `p` will hold the final value obtained by repeatedly calling `func_1(p + 1, m)` until `p` is no longer less than `n`, at which point `p` will be set to 0. The variable `j` will reflect the total number of iterations performed, and the other variables (`i`, `n`, `max_val`, and `m`) will retain their initial values. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 3) * max_val`, `n` remains the same, `max_val` remains the same, `p` is equal to `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is `j + 9`, and `k` must still be at least 3. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `n` remains the same, `max_val` remains the same, `p` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to `p + 1` and `m`, `p` is not equal to `n`, `j` is 3, `k` must still be at least 3, and the loop has been broken out of due to the condition `p >= n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
