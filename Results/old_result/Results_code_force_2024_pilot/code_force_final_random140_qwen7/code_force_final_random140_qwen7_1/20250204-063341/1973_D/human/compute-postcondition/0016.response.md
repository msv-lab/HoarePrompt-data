Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-2`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1) * n)`, and the new value of `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, i * n)`**.

In this scenario, the value of `i` remains `n-2` as it was initially. The function `func_1` is called with arguments `1` and `i * n`, which simplifies to `1` and `(n-2) * n`. The return value of this function call replaces the current value of `r`. Therefore, `r` now holds the return value of `func_1(1, (n-2) * n)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
