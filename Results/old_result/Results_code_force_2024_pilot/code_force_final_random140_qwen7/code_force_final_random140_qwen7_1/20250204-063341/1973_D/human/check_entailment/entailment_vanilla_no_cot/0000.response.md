Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:

1. **Query Handling**: The function `func_1` sends a query and expects a response. However, the program does not handle the case where the response might be `n+1`, which indicates that no valid `r` exists for the given `f(l, r)` value. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the program assumes every query will yield a valid `r`.

2. **Bounds Checking**: The program assumes that if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `r` must be `n`. This is not always true. The correct interpretation should be that if `r` is `n+1`, then no valid `r` exists for the given `f(l, r)` value.

3. **Assertion Errors**: The program uses assertions to check conditions that may not always hold. For example, the assertion `assert r == n` in `func_3` is problematic because `r` being `n+1` means no valid `r` exists, and the program should handle this case appropriately.

4. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in `func_3` for determining `max_val` and splitting the array into subarrays with the required product `m` is flawed. Specifically, the loop that tries to find `m` might not correctly identify the largest possible `m` that satisfies the conditions.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is 1 or when the array is very small. For example, if `k = 1`, the program should directly compute `f(1, n)` without unnecessary queries.

To fix these issues, the program needs to properly handle invalid responses, ensure correct bounds checking, and refine the logic for finding the largest `m` that satisfies the conditions.
