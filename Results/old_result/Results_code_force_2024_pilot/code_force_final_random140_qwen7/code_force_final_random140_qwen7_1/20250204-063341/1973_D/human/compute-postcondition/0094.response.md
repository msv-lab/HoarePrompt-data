Output State: **The program returns the value of p which is the return value of func_1(k * (p + 1), m)**

This means that the program returns the value stored in `p`, which was determined by calling `func_1` with arguments `k * (p + 1)` and `m`. Here, `k` is a positive integer, and `p` remains unchanged from its previous value.
