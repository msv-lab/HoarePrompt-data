Output State: **`j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits whatever loop or conditional block it was inside, but since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, we assume it's exiting from the most internal one. The values of `j`, `k`, and `p` remain unchanged.
