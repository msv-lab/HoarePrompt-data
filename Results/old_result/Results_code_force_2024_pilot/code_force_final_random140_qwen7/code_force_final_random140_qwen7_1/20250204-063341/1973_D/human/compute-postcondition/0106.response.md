Output State: After all the iterations, the variable `i` will be 0 because the loop starts with `i` as `n // k` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `m` will be `0 * max_val`, which is 0. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `max_val` also remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `p` will be the final value obtained by repeatedly calling `func_1(p + 1, m)` until `p` is no longer less than `n`, but since `m` is 0, `func_1(p + 1, 0)` will always return 0, making `p` eventually equal to 0. The variable `j` will reflect the total number of iterations performed across all loop executions, and `k` must still be at least 3. Additionally, `p` will be equal to 0, which is equal to `n`. The loop will have completed all its iterations, and no further actions will be taken after the last execution.
