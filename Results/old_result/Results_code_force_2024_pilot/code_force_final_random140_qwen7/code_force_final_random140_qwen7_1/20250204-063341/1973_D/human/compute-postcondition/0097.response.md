Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `i * n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, and `p` is not equal to `n`; `func_2(-1)` is called.**

In this case, the code `func_2(-1)` is executed, which does not affect the values of the existing variables (`j`, `k`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`). It simply calls the function `func_2` with the argument `-1`. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
