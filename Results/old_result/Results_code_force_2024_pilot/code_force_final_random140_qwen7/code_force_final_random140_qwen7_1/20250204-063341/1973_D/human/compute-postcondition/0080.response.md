Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `k + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - The postcondition states that if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop or an innermost if statement is broken.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified inside the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `k` stays the same.
   - The value of `p` remains the same as it was computed before the loop started and is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `k` remains a positive integer (unchanged).
   - `p` remains the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**.
