Output State: **`j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current context (which could be a loop or an if-else statement). The values of `j`, `k`, and `p` remain unchanged.
