Output State: **j is k, p is the return value of func_1(k * (p + 1), m), k is a positive integer.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `j` will be equal to `k` because the loop increments `j` from 1 to `k`. The variable `p` will be updated `k` times within the loop, each time it is set to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Since the loop does not have an else block, `p` will be updated regardless of whether it becomes greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the final value of `p` will be the result of applying `func_1` `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using `m` as the second argument each time. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is used as the upper limit for the loop iterations.
