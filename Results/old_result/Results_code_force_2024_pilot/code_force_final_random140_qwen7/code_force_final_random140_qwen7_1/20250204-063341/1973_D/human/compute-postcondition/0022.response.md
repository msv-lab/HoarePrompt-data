Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`, as well as the step `-1`. The variable `k` is not mentioned in the loop head but is used in the condition `n // k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n // k` down to 1 (inclusive) in steps of -1. This means `i` starts at `n // k` and decreases by 1 until it reaches 1.

3. **Determine Initial Values**:
   - `n` must be a positive integer because the loop requires `n // k` to be a valid non-negative integer.
   - `i` must start at `n // k` and decrease by 1 in each iteration.
   - `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, so we need to ensure `func_1(1, n)` is called.
   - `max_val` is determined based on the loop iterations, so we need to ensure the loop runs correctly to determine `max_val`.

4. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `n` must be a positive integer.
   - `i` must start at `n // k`.
   - `r` must be initialized as the return value of `func_1(1, n)`.
   - `max_val` must be initialized to 0 since it is updated based on the loop iterations.

Given these points, the initial state adjustments needed for the loop to execute properly are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0**
