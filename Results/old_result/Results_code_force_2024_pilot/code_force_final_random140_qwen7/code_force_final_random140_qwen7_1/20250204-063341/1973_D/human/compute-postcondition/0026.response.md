Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**

Explanation: The variable `p` is assigned the return value of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Since `m` is 0, `p` is effectively `func_1(p + 1, 0)`. The values of `j`, `k`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
