The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `l` and `x`, where `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. It prints these values and then reads an integer input from the user, which it returns. After the function concludes, the program will have returned the input integer `x`.
