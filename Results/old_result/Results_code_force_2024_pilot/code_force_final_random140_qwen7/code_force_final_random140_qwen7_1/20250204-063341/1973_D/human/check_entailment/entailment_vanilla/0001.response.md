Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function prints a query in the required format and reads the response.
   - It ensures the response is non-negative and returns the response value.
   - This function is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function prints the final answer in the required format and reads the response.
   - It asserts that the response is `1`, indicating the answer is correct.
   - This function is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function determines the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the specified property.
   - **Initialization**:
     - Reads `n` and `k`.
     - Initializes `max_val` to `0`.
   - **Finding `max_val`**:
     - Iterates from `i = n` down to `1`.
     - Calls `func_1(1, i * n)` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
     - If `r` is within bounds (`r <= n`), it sets `max_val` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - **Checking for valid `m`**:
     - Iterates from `i = n // k` down to `1`.
     - Sets `m` to `i * max_val`.
     - For each subarray, calls `func_1(p + 1, m)` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(p + 1, r) = m`.
     - If `p` exceeds `n`, it breaks the loop.
     - If `p` equals `n`, it calls `func_2(m)` to submit the answer.
   - **Fallback**:
     - If no valid `m` is found, calls `func_2(-1)`.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_3` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The functions correctly read `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - The logic for finding `max_val` seems correct. It iterates from the largest possible value down to 1, which is a good strategy to find the largest possible `max_val`.

2. **Finding `max_val`**:
   - The logic for finding `max_val` is correct. It checks if the calculated `r` is within bounds and updates `max_val` accordingly.

3. **Finding Valid `m`**:
   - The logic for checking if a valid `m` can be found is correct. It iterates from the largest possible value down to 1, setting `m` to `i * max_val` and checking if the subarrays can be formed with the required property.
   - The fallback logic to set `m` to `-1` if no valid `m` is found is correct.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The functions correctly handle the output and assertions as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **True**
