Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n // k` down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means `i` starts at `n // k` and decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n // k`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1`, which is `(n // k) - 1`.
   - **`n` and `k`**: These values do not change within the loop head, so they remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.
   - **Other variables**: `j`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

4. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now `(n // k) - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `j` remains the same.
   - `r` remains the same.
   - `max_val` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `p` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is (n // k) - 1, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, and `p` is not equal to `n`**.
