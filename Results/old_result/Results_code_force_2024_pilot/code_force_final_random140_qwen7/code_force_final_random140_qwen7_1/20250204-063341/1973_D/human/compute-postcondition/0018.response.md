Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-2`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1) * n)`, and `max_val` is `n-2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
