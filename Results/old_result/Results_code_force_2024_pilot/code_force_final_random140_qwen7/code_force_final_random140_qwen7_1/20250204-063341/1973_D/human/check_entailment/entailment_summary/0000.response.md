Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and maximum value equals \( m \).
2. The provided functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` seem to be designed to solve this problem interactively.
   - `func_1` is used to query the smallest \( r \) for a given \( l \) and \( x \).
   - `func_2` is used to submit the final answer \( m \) and verify its correctness.
   - `func_3` is the core function that attempts to find the largest possible \( m \). It iteratively tries to find suitable \( m \) values and uses `func_1` to check them.
   - `func_4` handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_3`.

3. Let's analyze the logic of `func_3`:
   - It first determines the maximum value \( \text{max\_val} \) such that \( f(1, \text{max\_val}) \leq n \).
   - Then, it tries to find the largest \( m \) that can be achieved by splitting the array into \( k \) subarrays, starting from the largest possible \( m \) down to 1.
   - For each candidate \( m \), it uses `func_1` to check if there exists a valid split.
   - If a valid split is found, it submits \( m \) using `func_2`.

4. The overall approach seems sound and covers all necessary steps to solve the problem according to the given constraints and requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
