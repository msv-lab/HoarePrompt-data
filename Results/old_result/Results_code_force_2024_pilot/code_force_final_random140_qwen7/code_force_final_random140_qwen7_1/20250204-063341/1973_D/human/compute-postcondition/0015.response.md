Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `0` in steps of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n-2`.

4. **Adjust other variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1) * n)` and is assigned to `func_1(1, i * n)`. Since `i` changes but `n` does not, `r` remains the same.

5. **Postconditions**:
   - `max_val` is either set to `i` if `r` is less than or equal to `n-1`, or remains unchanged if `r` is greater than `n-1`. However, since `r` does not change between iterations, `max_val` will remain the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-2`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1) * n)`, and `max_val` remains unchanged.**
