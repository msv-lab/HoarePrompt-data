Output State: **j is k, k is a positive integer, p is the return value of func_1(p + 1, m), and the loop has executed k times.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations with `j` reaching the value of `k`. The variable `p` retains the value it had after the last call to `func_1(p + 1, m)` within the loop. All other variables from the initial state remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
