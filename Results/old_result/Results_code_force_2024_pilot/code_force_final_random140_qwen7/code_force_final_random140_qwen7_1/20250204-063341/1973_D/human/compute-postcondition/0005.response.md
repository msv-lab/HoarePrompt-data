Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` in the expression `range(t)`.
2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` remains greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
