Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \). It then finds the largest integer \( i \) such that the result of a hypothetical function \( func_1(1, i \times n) \) is less than or equal to \( n \), storing this value in \( max\_val \). If no such \( i \) exists, \( max\_val \) remains 0. Next, it iterates over values of \( i \) from \( \frac{n}{k} \) down to 1, calculating \( m \) as \( i \times max\_val \). For each \( i \), it updates \( p \) by repeatedly calling \( func_1(p + 1, m) \) until \( p \) is no less than \( n \). If \( p \) equals \( n \) after these updates, it calls \( func_2(m) \) and returns. If no such \( i \) is found, it calls \( func_2(-1) \) and returns. The function does not return any value in all cases.**
