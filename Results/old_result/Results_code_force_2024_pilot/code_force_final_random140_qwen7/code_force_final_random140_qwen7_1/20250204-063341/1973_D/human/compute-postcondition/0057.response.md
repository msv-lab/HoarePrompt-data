Output State: **`j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `p` is updated to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**

Explanation: The variable `p` is initially set to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. After executing the line `p = func_1(p + 1, m)`, `p` is updated to the return value of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged.
