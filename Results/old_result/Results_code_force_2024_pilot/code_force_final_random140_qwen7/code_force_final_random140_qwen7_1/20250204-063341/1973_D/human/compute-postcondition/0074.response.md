Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `k` used in the range function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being set to 1 because the range function `range(1, k + 1)` means `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `k`.

3. **Determine the Value of `k`**: Since `k` is a positive integer, it must be a valid positive integer for the loop to execute. The initial state of `k` is given as a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `j` needs to be adjusted to its starting value, which is 1.
   - The variable `k` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop can execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `k` must be a positive integer**
