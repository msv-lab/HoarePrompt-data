Output State: **`j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `p` is updated to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned, the `break` statement is assumed to be breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `j`, `k`, and `p` remain unchanged, and `p` is still the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` before and after the `break`.
