State: **`j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, `p` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `k + 1` (exclusive). Therefore, at the start of the loop, `j` should be set to 1.
- The loop head does not directly depend on `i`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`, or `p`. These variables are initialized before the loop and their values do not change within the loop head itself.
- The loop head does depend on `k`, which is a positive integer, ensuring that the loop can execute.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `j` being set to 1.
