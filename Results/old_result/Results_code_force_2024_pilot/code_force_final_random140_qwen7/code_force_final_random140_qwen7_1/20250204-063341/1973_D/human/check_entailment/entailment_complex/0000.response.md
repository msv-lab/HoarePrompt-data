### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly prints a query in the required format and flushes the output. It then reads the response from the user and returns it. This function is used to query the smallest integer \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function prints the answer in the required format and flushes the output. It reads the response from the user but does not return anything. The function handles both valid and invalid responses appropriately.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Initialization**: It reads \( n \) and \( k \) and initializes `max_val` to 0.
   - **Finding Initial Maximum Value**: It iterates backward from \( n \) to 1, querying \( f(1, i \cdot n) \). If the response \( r \) is less than or equal to \( i \cdot n \), it sets `max_val` to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop. This step ensures that `max_val` is the largest possible value for which \( f(1, r) \leq r \cdot n \).
   - **Finding Valid Split**: It then iterates backward from \( n // k \) to 1, calculating \( m = i \cdot max_val \). It queries \( f(i+1, n) \) for each segment to check if the condition holds. If it finds a valid \( m \), it calls `func_2(m)` and returns.
   - **No Valid Split**: If no valid \( m \) is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function reads the number of test cases \( t \) and calls `func_3` for each test case. It ensures that the loop continues until all test cases are processed.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_3` is sound and follows the problem's requirements.
- `func_1` and `func_2` handle the interaction correctly.
- The overall structure of the program is designed to solve the problem as specified.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. All functions work in concert to achieve the desired outcome.

### Correctness:
**True**
