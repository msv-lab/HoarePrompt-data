Output State: `i` is `i - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is the same, `max_val` is the same, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `p` is not equal to `n`, `j` is 54, `k` must be at least 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j` in the range `1` to `k+1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, it implies that `k` must be at least 3. Since each iteration increments `j` by 18, after 3 iterations, `j` would be `3 * 18 = 54`. The loop will continue until `j` reaches `k+1`, so if `k` is at least 3, after the loop completes, `j` will be `k + 1 - 1 = k`, which is 54 in this case. All other variables (`i`, `m`, `n`, `max_val`, `p`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The condition `p < n` must hold true, and if `p` ever becomes greater than or equal to `n`, the loop breaks.
