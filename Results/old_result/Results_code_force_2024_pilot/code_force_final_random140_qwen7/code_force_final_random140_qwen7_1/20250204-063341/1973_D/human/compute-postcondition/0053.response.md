Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `j`, `k`, and `p` remain unchanged, and `p` retains its value as the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
