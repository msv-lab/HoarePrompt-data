Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1(l, x)`: This function prints a query to the standard output and reads the response. It ensures the response is valid.
   - `func_2(m)`: This function prints the final answer and checks if it is accepted.
   - `func_3()`: This function is responsible for finding the largest value \( m \) as described in the problem statement.
   - `func_4()`: This function handles multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - **Initialization**: It reads \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - **Finding Maximum Value**:
     - It iterates from \( i = n \) down to 1 to find the maximum value \( i \) such that \( f(1, i \cdot n) = i \cdot n \). This is done using `func_1(1, i * n)`.
     - If such an \( i \) is found, it sets `max_val` to \( i \).
   - **Checking for Valid Subarray Split**:
     - It iterates from \( i = n / k \) down to 1 to find a valid \( m = i \cdot max_val \).
     - For each \( m \), it tries to split the array into \( k \) subarrays such that each subarray has \( f(l, r) = m \).
     - It uses `func_1(p + 1, m)` to find the right endpoint \( r \) for each subarray.
     - If a valid split is found, it calls `func_2(m)` to submit the answer.
   - **No Valid Split Found**: If no valid split is found, it calls `func_2(-1)` to indicate that no such \( m \) exists.

3. **Function `func_4()`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_3()`.

### Verification Against Problem Statement:

1. **Query Limit**:
   - The code ensures that it does not exceed the query limit by carefully managing the number of queries made.
   
2. **Answer Submission**:
   - The code correctly submits the answer using `func_2(m)` and checks if the answer is accepted.

3. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for finding the maximum value \( i \) and checking for valid splits is sound.
   - The code handles the edge cases where no valid split exists by returning -1.

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It adheres to the constraints and performs the necessary operations within the specified limits.

**Correctness: True**
