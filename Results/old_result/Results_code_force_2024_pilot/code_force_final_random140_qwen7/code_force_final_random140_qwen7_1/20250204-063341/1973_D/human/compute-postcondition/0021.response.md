Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)`, and `max_val` is set to the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `i * n` for each iteration. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.**

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will be 1 because the loop decrements `i` from `n` to 1. The variable `r` will hold the return value of `func_1(1, 1 * n)` because it is the last value computed before the loop ends. The variable `max_val` will be set to the highest value of `i` where `r` was found to be less than or equal to `i * n` during any iteration of the loop. If `r` never satisfied the condition within the loop, `max_val` will remain 0.
