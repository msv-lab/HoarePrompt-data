Postcondition: **`i` will be less than `len(string)`, `i` will be equal to `len(string) - 1`, `k` will be either the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string` or one less than that (depending on whether `string[len(string) - 1] == m`), `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is not equal to `len(string)`**
