Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cnt_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string`.

2. **Single Character String Check:**
   - If the length of the string is 1, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because there are no other characters to rearrange into a different string.

3. **Character Frequency Check:**
   - The program initializes `m` with the first character of the string.
   - It counts how many times this character appears (`k`).
   - If `k` equals the length of the string, it means all characters in the string are the same, so the program prints 'No'. This is also correct because there are no other characters to rearrange into a different string.

4. **Generating Rearranged String:**
   - If the above conditions are not met, the program prints 'Yes' and then sorts the string and prints it.
   - Sorting the string will give a different arrangement of the characters unless all characters are identical, which has already been checked.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case: "codeforces"**
  - Length is 10, not 1.
  - All characters are different.
  - Output: `Yes` followed by a sorted version of the string, e.g., `codeforces` → `ccdefoorrst`.

- **Test Case: "aaaaa"**
  - Length is 5, not 1.
  - All characters are the same.
  - Output: `No`.

- **Test Case: "co"**
  - Length is 2, not 1.
  - Characters are different.
  - Output: `Yes` followed by a sorted version of the string, e.g., `co` → `co`.

- **Test Case: "d"**
  - Length is 1.
  - Output: `No`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the cases where the string length is 1 and where all characters are the same. For other cases, it generates a rearranged string by sorting the input string, which is a valid rearrangement unless the string consists of identical characters.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program meets the requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
