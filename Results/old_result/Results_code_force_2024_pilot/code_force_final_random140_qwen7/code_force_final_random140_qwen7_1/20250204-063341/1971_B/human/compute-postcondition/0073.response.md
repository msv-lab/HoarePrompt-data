Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is less than `len(string)`
- `i` equals the previous value of `i` plus 2
- `k` is either 1 or 2
- `total` remains unchanged
- `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged
- `t` remains unchanged
- `m` is the first character of `string`

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs for each index `i` in the range `range(len(string))`.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates.
2. **Variable `k`**: `k` can change based on the condition inside the loop, but it is not directly controlled by the loop itself.
3. **Other Variables**: `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, and `m` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts with `i` being the previous value of `i` plus 2 (if the condition was true).
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

2. **New Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` was previously `i + 2`, the new value of `i` will be `(i + 2) + 1 = i + 3`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(string)`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `k`, `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, and `m` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 3`.
- `k` remains unchanged (either 1 or 2).
- `total` remains unchanged.
- `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged (the first character of `string`).

### Final State:

State: **`i` is less than `len(string)` and equals the previous value of `i` plus 3, `k` is either 1 or 2, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`**.
