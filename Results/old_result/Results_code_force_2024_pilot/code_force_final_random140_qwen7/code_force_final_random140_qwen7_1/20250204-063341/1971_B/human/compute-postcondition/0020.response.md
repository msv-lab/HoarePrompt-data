Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is either 3 or the original value of `k` (which is 2), depending on whether `string[i]` equals `m`.**
