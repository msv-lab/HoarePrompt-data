Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to the length of `string` + 1, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`, `k` is 0.**

The code sets `k` to 0, which initializes `k` to zero. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
