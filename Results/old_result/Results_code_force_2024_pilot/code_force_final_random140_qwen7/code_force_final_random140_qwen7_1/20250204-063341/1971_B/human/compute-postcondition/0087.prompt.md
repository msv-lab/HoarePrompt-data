You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        
        m = string[0]
        
        k = 0
        
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))
        
    #State: Output State: All test cases specified by `cnt_test_cases` have been processed, and for each input string, the program has determined whether it should print 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string or 'No'. The variable `total` remains unchanged from its initial value, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, and `t` remains unchanged. For each input string, `i` is equal to the length of the string, `m` is the first character of the string, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in the string. If `k` is equal to the length of the string, the program prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the program has processed all test cases, printed 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string for those strings that do not consist entirely of the same character, and printed 'No' for those that do. The initial conditions and other variables outside the loop remain as they were initially.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. Based on these inputs, the function returns a result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
