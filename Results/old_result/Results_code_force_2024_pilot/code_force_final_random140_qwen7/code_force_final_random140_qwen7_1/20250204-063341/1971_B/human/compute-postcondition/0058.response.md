Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of `string` + 1.
- `k` is the total count of the first character `m` in the string `string.strip()`.
- `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, and `t` remain unchanged.

The `print('No')` statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
