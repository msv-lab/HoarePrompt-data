Output State: **`i` is less than `len(string)`, `i` equals the previous value of `i` plus 2, `k` is either 1 or 2, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is incremented by 1, so if `k` was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
