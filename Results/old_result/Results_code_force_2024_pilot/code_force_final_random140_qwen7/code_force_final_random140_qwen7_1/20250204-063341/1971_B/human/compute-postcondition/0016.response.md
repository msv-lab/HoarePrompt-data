Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 2, and if the second character of `string` is equal to `m`, then the current value of `string[i]` remains the second character of `string`; otherwise, the current value of `string[i]` remains the second character of `string`.**
