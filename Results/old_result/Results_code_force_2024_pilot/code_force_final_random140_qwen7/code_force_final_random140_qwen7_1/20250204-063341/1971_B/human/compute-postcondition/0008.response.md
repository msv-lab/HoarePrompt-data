Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 0.**

The code initializes `k` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
