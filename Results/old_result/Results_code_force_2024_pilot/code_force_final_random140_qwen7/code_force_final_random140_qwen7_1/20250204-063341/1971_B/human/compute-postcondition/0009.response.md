Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(string)`. 

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 0.
   - `len(string)` is the length of the string.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(string)`.
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, it will enter the loop as long as `i < len(string)`.
   - Therefore, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `len(string)` is at least 1 (since `i` starts from 0).

Given the initial state:
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is 0.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `len(string)` must be at least 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 0, `len(string)` must be at least 1**
