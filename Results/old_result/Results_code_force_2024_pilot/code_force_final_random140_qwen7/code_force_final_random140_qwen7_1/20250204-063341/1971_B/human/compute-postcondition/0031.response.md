Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is equal to the length of `string` + 1.
- `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`.
- `string` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
