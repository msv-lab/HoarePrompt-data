Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to the length of `string` + 1, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`, `string` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `string = input().strip()` takes an input string, strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it back to the variable `string`. The other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, `i`, `m`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
