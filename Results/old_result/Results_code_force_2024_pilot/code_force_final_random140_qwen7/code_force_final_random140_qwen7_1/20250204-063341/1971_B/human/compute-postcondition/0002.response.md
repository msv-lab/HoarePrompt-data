Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code reads a string from the input and strips it of any leading or trailing whitespace. This operation affects the `string` variable, setting it to the stripped input string. The other variables (`cnt_test_cases`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
