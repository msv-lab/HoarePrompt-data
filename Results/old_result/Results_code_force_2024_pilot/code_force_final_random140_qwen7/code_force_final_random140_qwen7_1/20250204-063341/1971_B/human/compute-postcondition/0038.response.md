Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is less than `len(string)`, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`, `k` is 1, and the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is incremented by 1. Initially, `k` was 0, so now `k` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
