Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(len(string))`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < len(string)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` must be less than `len(string)`.
   - `k` is either 0 or 1.
   - `total` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `m` is the first character of `string`.
   - If `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 1; otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `len(string)`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged unless `string[i]` is equal to `m`.
   - `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1).
- `total` remains unchanged.
- `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged (the first character of `string`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is less than `len(string)` and equals the previous value of `i` plus 1, `k` is either 0 or 1, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`**.
