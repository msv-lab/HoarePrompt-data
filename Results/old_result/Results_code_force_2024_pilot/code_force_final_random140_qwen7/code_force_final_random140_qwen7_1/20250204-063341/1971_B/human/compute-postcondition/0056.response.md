Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `cnt_test_cases`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `cnt_test_cases`.

3. **Understand the current state after the if-else block**:
   - `i` will be equal to the length of `string`.
   - `k` will be the total count of the first character `m` in the string `string`.
   - All other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`) will remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is now equal to the length of `string`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to the length of `string` + 1, `k` is the total count of the first character `m` in the string `string`, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged**.
