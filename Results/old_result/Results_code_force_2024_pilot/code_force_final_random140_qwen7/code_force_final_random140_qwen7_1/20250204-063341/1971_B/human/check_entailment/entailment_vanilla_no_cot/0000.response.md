Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that for a single-character string, no rearrangement is possible other than the string itself, so it prints "No". This part is correct.

2. **Checking for All Characters Being the Same**: The program checks if all characters in the string are the same by comparing the first character with every other character. If they are all the same, it prints "No". However, this check is insufficient. For example, the string "abc" should also be considered as having no valid rearrangement that is different from itself.

3. **Generating a Different String**: The program sorts the string and prints it. Sorting a string will only give a different string if the original string had duplicate characters. For strings like "abc", sorting would result in the same string, which is not a valid solution according to the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle cases where the string has unique characters but still needs to be rearranged to produce a different string. For example, "co" should have a valid rearrangement ("oc"), but the current implementation does not generate it.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(string)) == 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            # Generate a different string by swapping two characters
            for i in range(len(string)):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(string)):
                    new_string = string[:i] + string[j] + string[i+1:j] + string[i] + string[j+1:]
                    if new_string != string:
                        print(new_string)
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                print('No')  # Fallback to print 'No' if no different string can be formed

func()
```

This corrected program:
- Checks if the string is a single character or if all characters are the same.
- If these conditions are met, it prints "No".
- Otherwise, it attempts to find and print a different string by swapping two characters. If no such swap can be made, it prints "No".
