Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the length of `string`, `k` is the total count of the first character `m` in the string `string`, and all other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. Additionally, the condition `k` equals the length of `string` is true.**
