Output State: All test cases specified by `cnt_test_cases` have been processed, and for each input string, the program has determined whether it should print 'Yes' or 'No' based on the criteria provided. Specifically, for each string, if the string consists of a single unique character repeated throughout, the program prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string.

All variables outside the loop, including `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, and `t`, remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the last processed string, `m` will be the first character of the last processed string, and `k` will be the total count of occurrences of `m` in the last processed string. If `k` equals the length of the last string, the program printed 'No' for that string; otherwise, it printed 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string.
