Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is equal to the length of `string`.
- `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`.
- The value of `k` is equal to the length of `string`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'No'`. The values of other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, `i`, `string`, `m`, and `k`) are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **No**
