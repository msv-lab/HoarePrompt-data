Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `string` + 1, `k` is the total count of the first character `m` in the string `string.strip()`, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `string = input().strip()` reads an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns it to the variable `string`. The values of `i`, `k`, `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, and `t` remain unchanged. The updated value of `string` is used in subsequent operations, but its length and the count of the first character `m` are now based on the stripped input.
