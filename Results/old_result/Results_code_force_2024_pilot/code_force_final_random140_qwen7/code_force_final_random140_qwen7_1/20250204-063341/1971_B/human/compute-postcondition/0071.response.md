Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(string)`, `i` equals the previous value of `i` plus 2, `k` is either 1 or 2, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`. This is because if `string[i] == m` is true, `i` is incremented by 2 and `k` becomes either 1 or 2. If the condition is false, `i` does not change from its previous value plus 1, and `k` remains either 0 or 1, but the other variables remain unchanged.
