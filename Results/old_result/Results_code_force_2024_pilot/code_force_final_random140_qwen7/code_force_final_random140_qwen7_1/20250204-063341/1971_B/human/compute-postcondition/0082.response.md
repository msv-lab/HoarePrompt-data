Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be less than `len(string)`, and it is specifically mentioned that `i` will be equal to `len(string) - 1`.
- `k` will be either the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string` or one less than that, depending on whether `string[len(string) - 1] == m`.
- `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is not equal to `len(string)`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the `print(''.join(sorted(string)))` statement:

1. Since `i` is `len(string) - 1`, it means the last character of `string` is the `(len(string) - 1)`th character.
2. `k` is either the count of `m` in `string` or `count(m) - 1`, depending on whether the last character of `string` is `m`.

To determine the exact value of `k`, we need to know the value of `m` and the content of `string`. However, since `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is not equal to `len(string)`, we can infer that `k` is the count of `m` in `string` minus 1 if the last character is `m`, or just the count of `m` otherwise.

Regardless of the exact value of `k`, the `print(''.join(sorted(string)))` statement sorts the characters of `string` alphabetically and then joins them into a single string.

Let's denote the sorted string as `sorted_string`.

Output: **sorted_string (where sorted_string is the string obtained by sorting the characters of string alphabetically)**
