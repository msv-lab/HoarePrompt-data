Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `string`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over the length of the string using `range(len(string))`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(string)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
   - `i` is 0
   - `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
   - `m` is the first character of `string`
   - `k` is 1
   - The current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `i < len(string)` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Ensure other variables remain unchanged**:
   - `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, `string`, `m`, and `k` do not change within the loop head and thus remain the same.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `total` remains 0
   - `cnt_test_cases` remains greater than 0
   - `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
   - `i` changes to 1
   - `string` remains the same
   - `m` remains the first character of `string`
   - `k` remains 1
   - The current value of `string[i]` is now the second character of `string` (since `i` is now 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 1, and the current value of `string[i]` is the second character of `string`**
