Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `string` + 1, `k` is the total count of the first character `m` in the string `string.strip()`, `total` remains unchanged, `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is the first character of `string`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first character of the string `string` to the variable `m`. The values of other variables (`i`, `k`, `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`) remain unchanged.
