Output State: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`; `k` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `k` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain in their initial or previously described states.
