State: **`cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for i in range(cnt_test_cases):` will execute as long as `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0.
2. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop.
3. The variable `t` is mentioned but does not affect the loop's execution condition directly. It is a separate positive integer constraint.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (though this doesn't directly affect the loop's execution, it is included as part of the initial state)
