Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(string) - 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (meaning it was `i-1` at the start of the previous iteration)
   - `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
   - `m` is the first character of `string`
   - `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`
   - If `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is incremented by 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, `string`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`
- All other variables (`total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, `string`, `m`, `k`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`**.
