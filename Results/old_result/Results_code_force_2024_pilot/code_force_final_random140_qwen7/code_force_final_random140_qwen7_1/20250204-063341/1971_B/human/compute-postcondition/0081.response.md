Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be equal to `len(string) - 1`. This means `i` is the last index of the string.
- `k` will be either the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string` or one less than that, depending on whether `string[len(string) - 1] == m`. Since `i` is the last index and `k` is not equal to `len(string)`, `k` must be the total number of occurrences of `m` in `string`.
- `total`, `cnt_test_cases`, `t`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is the first character of `string`.

The `print('Yes')` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
