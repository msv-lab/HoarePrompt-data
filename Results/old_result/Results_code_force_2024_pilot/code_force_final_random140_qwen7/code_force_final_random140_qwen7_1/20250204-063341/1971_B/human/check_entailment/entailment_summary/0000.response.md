Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the first condition where a string consists entirely of the same character. In such cases, it prints 'No', which is correct because no rearrangement of the string can be different from the original.
- For strings with more than one unique character, the program sorts the string and prints it along with 'Yes'. This approach works for strings with at least two distinct characters because sorting will result in a different string from the original.
- However, there is an issue with the logic that checks if a string consists entirely of the same character. The current implementation uses a simple comparison with the first character (`m = string[0]; k = 0; ... if k == len(string):`). This logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of multiple occurrences of the first character within the string.
- A better approach would be to check if all characters in the string are the same using a set. If the length of the set is 1, then the string consists of the same character repeated.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it fails to properly identify strings that consist entirely of the same character.

Correctness: **False**
