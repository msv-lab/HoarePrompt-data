Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 1, and the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`**.

This postcondition summarizes that if the condition `string[i] == m` is true, then `k` is set to 1 and the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`. Since there is no else part, the values of other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition.
