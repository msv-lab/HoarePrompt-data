Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `a` is an integer from the input
- `b` is an integer from the input

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs `t` times.
- The loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the value is not needed) does not affect the state.
- The only variable that affects the loop condition is `t`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `t > 0`.
2. **End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since each iteration reduces `t` by 1).

### Adjusted States:
- `t` must be decremented by 1, so it becomes `t - 1`.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**

In a more concise form:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` - 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**
