The function processes up to 100 test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` set to 1, reflecting the number of remaining test cases (which would be 0 if all cases were processed).
