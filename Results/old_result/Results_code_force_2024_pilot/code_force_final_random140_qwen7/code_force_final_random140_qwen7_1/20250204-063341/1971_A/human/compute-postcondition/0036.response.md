Functionality: **The function processes a series of pairs of integers (a, b) based on user input. For each pair, it prints the larger number followed by the smaller number. The function takes no parameters and does not return any value. After processing all pairs, it sets `t` to 0 and `n` to the number of input pairs, while ensuring that for each pair, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
