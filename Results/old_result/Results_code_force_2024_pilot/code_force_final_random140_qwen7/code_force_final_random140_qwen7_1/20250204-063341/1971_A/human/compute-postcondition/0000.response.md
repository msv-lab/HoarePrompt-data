Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and `t` is now the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 remains valid only if the user inputs a value within this range. Otherwise, the range restriction is no longer applicable. However, since the problem does not specify any further actions or conditions, we assume the input is valid. Therefore, `t` is now the integer input by the user, and the range condition is implied to be checked during the input process.
