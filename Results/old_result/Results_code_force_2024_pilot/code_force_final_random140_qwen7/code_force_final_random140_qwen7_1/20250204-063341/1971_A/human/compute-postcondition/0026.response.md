Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is an input integer that is adjusted to be equal to `b` or less than `b` depending on the input.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the value of `n` is not modified within the loop itself.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains 0 (since `t` is not modified within the loop).
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (adjusted to be equal to `b` or less than `b`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `a` is an input integer that is adjusted to be equal to `b` or less than `b` depending on the input.**
