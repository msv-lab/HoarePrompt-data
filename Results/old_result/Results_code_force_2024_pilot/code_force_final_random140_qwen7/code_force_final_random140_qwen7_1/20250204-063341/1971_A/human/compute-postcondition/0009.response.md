Output: **max(a, b), min(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the maximum of the two integers obtained from the input and min(a, b) is the minimum of the two integers obtained from the input)**

Explanation:
- The initial state defines that `t` is set to 1, but this variable is not used in the code snippet provided.
- `a` and `b` are both integers obtained from the input, with their values being updated to the integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping them to integers.
- The `print` statement then outputs the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`.

Since the actual input values for `a` and `b` are not provided, the output will be in terms of these values, indicating the maximum and minimum of the two integers.
