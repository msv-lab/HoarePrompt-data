You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 100 test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` set to 1, reflecting the number of remaining test cases (which would be 0 if all cases were processed).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of input.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: It then iterates `t` times, processing each test case individually.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.
4. **Finding Maximum and Minimum**: It uses the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to find the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b`, respectively.
5. **Output Formatting**: It prints the results in the required format, with the maximum value first, followed by the minimum value.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all specified constraints (number of test cases, range of input values), it should produce the correct output for any valid input.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
