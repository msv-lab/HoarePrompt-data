Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is equal to the previous value of `t` - 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input, and they are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user separated by a space.

The `print(max(a, b), min(a, b))` statement will print the maximum and minimum of the two integers `a` and `b`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we will describe them in terms of their relationship to each other.

- If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `max(a, b)` will be `a` and `min(a, b)` will be `b`.
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `max(a, b)` will be `b` and `min(a, b)` will be `a`.

Therefore, the output will be a pair of numbers where the first number is the larger of `a` and `b`, and the second number is the smaller of `a` and `b`.

Output: **max(a, b), min(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the larger of the two integers entered and min(a, b) is the smaller of the two integers entered)**
