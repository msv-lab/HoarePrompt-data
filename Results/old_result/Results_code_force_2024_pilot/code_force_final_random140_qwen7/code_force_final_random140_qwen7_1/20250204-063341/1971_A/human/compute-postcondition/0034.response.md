Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, and for every iteration `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `a[j]` and `b[j]` are integers from the input such that `a[j]` is either equal to `b[j]` or less than `b[j]`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged at 0, `n` retains its initial value which was an input integer greater than 0, and `i` will be `n-1` since the loop runs from `i` in `range(n)`. For each pair `(a[j], b[j])` processed in the loop, the condition that `a[j]` is either equal to `b[j]` or less than `b[j]` holds true for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
