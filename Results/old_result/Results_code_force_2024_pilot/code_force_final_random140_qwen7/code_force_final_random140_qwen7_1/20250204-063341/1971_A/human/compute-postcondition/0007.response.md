Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is equal to the previous value of `t` - 1.
   - `a` and `b` are integers from the input.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was equal to its previous value minus 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be 1 (since it was decremented once).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` must be 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**
