Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not follow the problem description correctly. According to the problem description, the output should be the minimum value followed by the maximum value for each test case. However, the program currently prints the maximum value followed by the minimum value. For example, for the input `1 9`, the expected output is `1 9` but the program outputs `9 1`. This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
