Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 1 and will continue to decrease until it reaches 0, at which point the loop will terminate. At each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided by the user. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 1, and `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
