Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, it processes two integers `x` and `y` where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9. Based on these inputs, the function returns different outputs depending on the values of `x` and `y`.**

However, since the specific logic for returning different outputs based on `x` and `y` is not provided, the exact return values cannot be specified. The function likely performs some operations or checks on `x` and `y` for each of the `t` test cases and returns the results accordingly.
