Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[1]` divided by 10 and converted to an integer, `c` is a list containing the element `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. Given that `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` now contains the element `a[1]`.
