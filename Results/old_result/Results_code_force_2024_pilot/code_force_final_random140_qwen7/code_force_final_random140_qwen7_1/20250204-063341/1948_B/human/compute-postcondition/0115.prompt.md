Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `c` is a list containing elements based on the value of `a[i]`, and `n` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, then `c` contains `y` and `x` where `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10 and `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, and `n` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, then `c` contains `a[0]`, and `n` is 1. If `i` is 1, then `c` contains `a[0]`, and `n` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `c` is a list that either contains the elements 0 and the last digit of `a[1]`, or the elements `a[1] // 10` and `a[1] % 10`, `n` is increased by either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[1] > 10` or not, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `c` is a list containing either `[y, x]` where `y` is the integer value of `int(a[2] / 10)` and `x` is the integer value of `a[2] % 10`, and `y <= x`; or a list containing the single element `a[2]`; `n` is 1 more than its initial value, which was 2; `len(a)` is greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
