Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer value which is the last digit of `a[1]`; `y` is 0; `c` is a list with one element `a[1]`; `n` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = n + 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Since `n` was not initialized before this line of code, it is assumed to be 0 initially (as it is not given any specific value). After executing the line, `n` becomes 1. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
