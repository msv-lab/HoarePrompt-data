### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting any element greater than or equal to 10 into its constituent digits and inserting those digits back into the array.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` processes a single test case, extracting digits from elements greater than or equal to 10, sorting them, and appending 1 or 0 to the list `b` based on whether the sorted digits match the original sequence after digit extraction.

#### Program Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   ```python
   m = int(input())
   b = []
   for i in range(m):
       func_1()
   for i in range(m):
       if b[i] == 1:
           print('YES')
       else:
           print('NO')
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result in the list `b`.
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the contents of `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1():
       k = int(input())
       a = input()
       a = list(map(int, a.split()))
       x = 0
       y = 0
       n = 0
       c = []
       for i in range(len(a)):
           if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
               x = int(a[i] % 10)
               y = int(a[i] / 10)
               if y >= c[n - 1]:
                   if y <= x:
                       c.append(y)
                       c.append(x)
                       n = n + 2
                   else:
                       c.append(a[i])
                       n = n + 1
               else:
                   c.append(a[i])
                   n = n + 1
           elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
               x = int(a[i] % 10)
               y = int(a[i] / 10)
               if y <= x:
                   c.append(y)
                   c.append(x)
                   n = n + 2
               else:
                   c.append(a[i])
                   n = n + 1
           else:
               c.append(a[i])
               n = n + 1
       d = sorted(c)
       if c == d:
           b.append(1)
       else:
           b.append(0)
   ```
   - The function reads the number of elements `k` and the array `a`.
   - It processes each element in `a`, splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits.
   - It checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted and appends 1 or 0 to `b` accordingly.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Handling Single-Digit Numbers:**
   - The function correctly handles single-digit numbers by simply appending them to the list `c` without modification.
   - This ensures that the presence of single-digit numbers does not affect the sorting logic.

2. **Splitting and Sorting Logic:**
   - The function correctly splits elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits.
   - It ensures that the digits are appended in the correct order and checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted.
   - If the list `c` is sorted, it appends 1 to `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.

3. **Overall Logic:**
   - The program correctly processes each test case and determines if the array can be sorted using the specified operation.
   - The final output is determined based on the contents of `b`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment incorrectly identified issues that do not exist in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
