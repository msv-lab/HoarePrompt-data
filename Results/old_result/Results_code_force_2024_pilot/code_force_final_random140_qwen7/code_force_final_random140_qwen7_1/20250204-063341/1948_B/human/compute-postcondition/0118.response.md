Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing elements processed from the list `a` according to the rules defined in the loop, `d` is a sorted version of `c`, `b` is a list containing the element 1.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(1)` appends the integer `1` to the list `b`. The values of `i`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `len(a)`, `c` is still a list containing elements processed from the list `a` according to the rules defined in the loop, and `d` is still a sorted version of `c`. Additionally, `b` now contains the element `1`.
