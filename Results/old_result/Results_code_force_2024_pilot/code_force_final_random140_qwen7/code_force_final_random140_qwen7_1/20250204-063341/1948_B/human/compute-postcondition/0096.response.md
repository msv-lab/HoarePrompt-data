Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `y` is an integer value equal to `int(a[2] / 10)'; `c` is a list with the element `a[2]`.**

The code appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
