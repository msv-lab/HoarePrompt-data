Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, the function determines and returns some unspecified result based on the provided data.**

Note: The specific result to be returned for each test case is not detailed in the given information.
