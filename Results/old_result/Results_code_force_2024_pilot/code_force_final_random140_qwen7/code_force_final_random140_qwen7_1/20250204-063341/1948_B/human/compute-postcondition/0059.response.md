Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer value which is the last digit of `a[1]`; `y` is 0; `c` is a list containing the element 0.**

The code `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` (which is 0) to the list `c`. Since no other changes were made to the variables `i`, `x`, or `y`, their values remain unchanged. The list `c` now contains the element 0.
