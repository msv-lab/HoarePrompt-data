Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[1]` divided by 10 and converted to an integer, `c` is a list containing the value of `y`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `c`. Since `y` is already defined as `a[1] // 10`, the list `c` now contains this value. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
