Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly processes each test case by extracting digits from numbers greater than 10 and sorting them.
   - It checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted and appends 1 to `b` if it is, otherwise appends 0.
   
2. **Main Program Logic Analysis**:
   - The main program initializes an empty list `b` and iterates over the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`, which processes the test case and updates `b`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic within `func_1()` correctly implements the problem's requirements.
   - The main program correctly processes each test case and prints the appropriate result.
   - There is no logical error in the provided code that would cause incorrect outputs based on the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
