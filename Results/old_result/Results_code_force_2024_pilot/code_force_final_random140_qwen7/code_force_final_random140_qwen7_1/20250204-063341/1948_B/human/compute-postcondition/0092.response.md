Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `y` is an integer value equal to `int(a[2] / 10)'; `c` is a list with one element `a[2]`**.

The code appends `a[i]` to the list `c`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]`. Therefore, `c` now contains `a[2]`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
