Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10; `y` is `a[1]` divided by 10 and converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i]` divided by 10 and then converted to an integer to `y`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `y` is the integer division result of `a[1]` by 10.
