Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0**.

The code `n = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
