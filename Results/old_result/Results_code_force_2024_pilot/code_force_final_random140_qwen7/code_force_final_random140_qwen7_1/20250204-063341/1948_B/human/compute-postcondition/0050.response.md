Output State: **`c` contains the element `a[0]`, `i` is `0`, `len(a)` is greater than `0`, `a[i]` is less than or equal to `10`, and `i` is less than or equal to `0`**.

Explanation: The code appends the element `a[i]` to the list `c`. Given that `i` is `0` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `10`, `c` will contain the element `a[0]`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
