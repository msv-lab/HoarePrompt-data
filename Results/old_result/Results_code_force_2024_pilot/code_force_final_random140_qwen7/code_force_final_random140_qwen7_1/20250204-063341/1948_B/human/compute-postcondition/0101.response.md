Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `y` is an integer value equal to `int(a[2] / 10)`**

Explanation: The variable `y` is assigned the value of `int(a[i] / 10)`. Given that `i` is 2, `y` becomes `int(a[2] / 10)`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `len(a)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
