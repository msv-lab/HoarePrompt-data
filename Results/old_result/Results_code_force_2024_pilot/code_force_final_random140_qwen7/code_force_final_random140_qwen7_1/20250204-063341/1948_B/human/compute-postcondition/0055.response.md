Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `c` is a list containing elements based on the value of `a[i]`, and `n` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, then `c` contains `y` and `x` where `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10 and `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, and `n` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, then `c` contains `a[0]`, and `n` is 1. If `i` is 1, then `c` contains `a[0]`, and `n` is 1.
