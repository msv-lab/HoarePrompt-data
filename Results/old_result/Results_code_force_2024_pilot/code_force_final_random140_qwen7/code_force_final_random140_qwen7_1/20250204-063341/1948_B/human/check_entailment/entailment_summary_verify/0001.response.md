### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the program. The key problems were:

1. The program did not call `func_1()` correctly within the loop that processes each test case.
2. The `b` list was not updated with the results of `func_1()`.

The corrected version provided in the assessment addresses these issues by properly calling `func_1()` and updating the `b` list with the results. The logic within `func_1()` is also correct, as it processes each test case and determines whether the array can be sorted by extracting and sorting digits from the numbers.

Given that the corrected version ensures that `b` is updated with the correct results and the logic within `func_1()` is sound, the program is now correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program, after the corrections, is now correct and accurately determines whether it is possible to sort the array using the specified operations.
