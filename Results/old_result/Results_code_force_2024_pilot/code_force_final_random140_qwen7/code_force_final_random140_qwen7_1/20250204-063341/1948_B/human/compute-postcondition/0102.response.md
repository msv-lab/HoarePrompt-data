Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `y` is an integer value equal to `int(a[2] / 10)`, and `c` contains the value of `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `y` to the list `c`. Since `y` is already defined as `int(a[2] / 10)`, appending it to `c` does not change its value. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
