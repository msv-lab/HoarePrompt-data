You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n integers. It extracts digits from these integers under certain conditions, sorts the extracted digits, and appends either 1 or 0 to a list `b` based on whether the extracted digits are already sorted or not. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `b` with the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array elements are single-digit numbers. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
2
10 2
```

According to the problem description, the array `[10, 2]` can be transformed into `[1, 0, 2]` which is sorted. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. The `func_1` function does not process single-digit numbers properly, and it does not account for the possibility of splitting the number `10` into `[1, 0]`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program does not handle single-digit numbers correctly.
2. The logic for splitting and sorting the array is incomplete and does not cover all necessary cases.

Since the program fails to handle certain cases correctly, it is not fully compliant with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
