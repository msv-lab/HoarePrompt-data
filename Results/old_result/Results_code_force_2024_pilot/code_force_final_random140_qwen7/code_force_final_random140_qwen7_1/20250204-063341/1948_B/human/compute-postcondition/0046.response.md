Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `c` is a list that either contains `y` and `x` (if `y` is less than or equal to `x`) or contains `a[i]` (if `y` is greater than `x`), and `n` is either 2 or 1.
