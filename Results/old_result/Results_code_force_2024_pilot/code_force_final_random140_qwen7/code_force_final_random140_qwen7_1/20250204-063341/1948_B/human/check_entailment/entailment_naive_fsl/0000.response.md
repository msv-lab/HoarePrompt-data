Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array elements are single-digit numbers. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
2
10 2
```

According to the problem description, the array `[10, 2]` can be transformed into `[1, 0, 2]` which is sorted. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. The `func_1` function does not process single-digit numbers properly, and it does not account for the possibility of splitting the number `10` into `[1, 0]`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program does not handle single-digit numbers correctly.
2. The logic for splitting and sorting the array is incomplete and does not cover all necessary cases.

Since the program fails to handle certain cases correctly, it is not fully compliant with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
