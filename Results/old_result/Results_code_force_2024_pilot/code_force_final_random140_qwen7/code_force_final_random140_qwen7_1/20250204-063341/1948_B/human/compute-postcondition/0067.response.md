Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer value which is the last digit of `a[1]`; `y` is 0; `c` is a list with the element `a[1]`; `n` is `n + 1`.**

In this case, the code `n = n + 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Since the initial state did not specify the value of `n`, we only know that `n` is now `n + 1`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
