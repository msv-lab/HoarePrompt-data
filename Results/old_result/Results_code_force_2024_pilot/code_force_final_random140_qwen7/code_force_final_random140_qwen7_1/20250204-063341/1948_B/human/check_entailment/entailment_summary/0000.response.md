Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
2. It initializes an empty list `b` to store the result for each test case.
3. The program iterates over the test cases but calls `func_1()` without passing any parameters, which is incorrect since `func_1()` expects some inputs.
4. Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the length of the array `k` and the array elements as a string, splits them into integers, and then processes the array to check if the digits can be rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence.
5. The logic inside `func_1()` seems to correctly extract digits from numbers greater than 10 and check if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
6. The program appends 1 to `b` if the digits are sorted, otherwise, it appends 0.
7. After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

However, the issue lies in the fact that the program does not properly handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the program should process each test case and print the result directly after processing each one, rather than storing the results in a list and printing them all at once.

Given the logic inside `func_1()` and the overall structure of the program, the program would work correctly if it were to print the result after processing each test case instead of storing the results in a list.

Therefore, the program is logically correct for the given problem, but it does not follow the exact output format specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
