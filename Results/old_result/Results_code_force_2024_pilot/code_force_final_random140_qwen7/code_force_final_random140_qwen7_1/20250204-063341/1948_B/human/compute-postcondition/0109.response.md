Output State: **`i` is 2; `c` contains an element from `a` at index 2; `len(a)` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) from list `a` to list `c`. Since `i` is 2, `c` now includes the element from `a` at index 2. The length of `a` remains greater than 0 as no changes were made to it.
