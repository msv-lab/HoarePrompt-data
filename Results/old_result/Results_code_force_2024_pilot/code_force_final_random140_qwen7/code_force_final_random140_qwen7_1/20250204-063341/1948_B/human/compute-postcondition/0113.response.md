Postcondition: `i` is 2, `c` is a list containing either `[y, x]` where `y` is the integer value of `int(a[2] / 10)` and `x` is the integer value of `a[2] % 10`, and `y <= x`; or a list containing the single element `a[2]`; `n` is 1 more than its initial value, which was 2; `len(a)` is greater than 0.
