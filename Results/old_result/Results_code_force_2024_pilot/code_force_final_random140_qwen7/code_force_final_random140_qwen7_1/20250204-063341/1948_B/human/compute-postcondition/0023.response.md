Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, the first element of `a` is greater than 10, `y` is the first element of `a` divided by 10 and converted to an integer, the remainder of the first element of `a` divided by 10 is equal to `x`, and either `y` is greater than or equal to `c[1]` (if `y <= x`) or `c` is a list with at least two elements where the second element is `x` and `y` is less than `c[1]` (if `y > x`).
