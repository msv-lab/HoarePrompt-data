Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `len(a)` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i] % 10` to `x`, where `i` is 2. This means `x` is the last digit of the element at index 2 in list `a`. The length of list `a` remains greater than 0 as no changes were made to it in the code.
