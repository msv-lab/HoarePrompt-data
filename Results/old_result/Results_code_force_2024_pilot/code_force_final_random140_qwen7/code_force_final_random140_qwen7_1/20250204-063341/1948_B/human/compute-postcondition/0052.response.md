Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, and either:
- `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `c` is a list containing either `y` and `x` (if `y` is less than or equal to `x`) or `a[i]` (if `y` is greater than `x`), and `n` is 2.
- or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, `c` contains the element `a[0]`, `i` is 1, and `n` is not specified (but it does not affect the overall postcondition as it is not defined in the else part).
