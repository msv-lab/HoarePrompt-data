Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing elements processed from the list `a` according to the rules defined in the loop, `d` is a sorted version of `c`, `b` contains the element 0 appended.**

The code `b.append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list `b`. The values of `i`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `len(a)`, `c` remains as a list containing elements processed from `a` according to the loop rules, and `d` is still the sorted version of `c`. Additionally, `b` now contains the element `0` appended to it.
