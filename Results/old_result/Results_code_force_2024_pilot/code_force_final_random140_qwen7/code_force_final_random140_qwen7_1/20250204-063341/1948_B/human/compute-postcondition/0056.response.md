Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.

3. **Consider the possible values for `i` and `len(a)`**:
   - If `i` is 0, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - If `i` is 1, the loop will terminate because `i` will no longer be less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - If `i` was 0, it will become 1.
   - `len(a)` remains the same since it is an attribute of the list `a` and does not change within the loop head.

5. **Finalize the state**:
   - Since `i` will be incremented to 1, the new state should reflect this change.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0**
