Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[1]` divided by 10 and converted to an integer, `c` is a list containing the value of `y` and `x`, `n` is `n + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `n = n + 2` increments the value of `n` by 2. However, since the initial value of `n` is not specified, we only know that `n` has been incremented by 2. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
