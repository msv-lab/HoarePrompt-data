The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n integers. It extracts digits from these integers under certain conditions, sorts the extracted digits, and appends either 1 or 0 to a list `b` based on whether the extracted digits are already sorted or not. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `b` with the results.
