Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, the first element of `a` is greater than 10, `y` is the first element of `a` divided by 10 and converted to an integer, the remainder of the first element of `a` divided by 10 is equal to `x`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then `y` remains unchanged and `n` is 2. Otherwise, `n` is incremented by 1 and `c` is appended with the first element of `a`.
