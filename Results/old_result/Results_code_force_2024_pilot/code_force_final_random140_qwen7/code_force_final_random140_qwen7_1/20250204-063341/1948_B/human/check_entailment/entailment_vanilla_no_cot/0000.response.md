Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input:**
   - The function `func_1` reads input as a string and splits it, but it should directly read integers.
   - The program reads the entire input string for `a` and then converts it to integers, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. **Logic Error in `func_1`:**
   - The logic for splitting the digits of numbers greater than 10 is not correctly implemented.
   - The program incorrectly handles the sorting and checking of the array.

3. **Global Variable Usage:**
   - The variable `b` is used to store results, but it is not initialized before use.
   - The program assumes that `b` is updated within `func_1`, but it does not properly update it.

4. **Output Logic:**
   - The output logic is flawed. It checks if `c` is sorted and appends 1 or 0 to `b`, but it does not actually return the correct result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
m = int(input())
b = []

for i in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = []
    for num in a:
        if num > 10:
            c.extend([int(d) for d in str(num)])
        else:
            c.append(num)
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)

for res in b:
    if res == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version properly reads the input, processes the array, checks if it is sorted, and prints the correct result for each test case.
