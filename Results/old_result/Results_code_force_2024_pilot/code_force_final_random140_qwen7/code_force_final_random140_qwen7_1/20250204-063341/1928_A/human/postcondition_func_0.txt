The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). It checks specific conditions related to the parity of \(a\) and \(b\) and prints 'YES' if the conditions are not met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the result for each test case.
