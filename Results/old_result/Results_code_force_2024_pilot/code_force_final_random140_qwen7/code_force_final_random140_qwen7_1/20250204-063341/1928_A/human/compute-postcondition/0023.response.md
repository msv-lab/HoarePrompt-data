Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer. If the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is true, the program performs some unspecified action. If the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is false, the program also performs some unspecified action.**
