Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `a` is the first integer entered.
- `b` is the second integer entered.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is even.
- The condition \((a / 2 == b \text{ and } b \% 2 != 0 \text{ or } (b / 2 == a \text{ and } a \% 2 != 0))\) is false.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

Given the condition described, the value of the string `'YES'` is directly printed without any modification based on the variables `a` and `b`.

Output: **YES**
