Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, and either both `a` and `b` are odd integers, or at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and either `a / 2 == b` with `b` being odd or `b / 2 == a` with `a` being odd, or the condition `(a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0))` is false.
