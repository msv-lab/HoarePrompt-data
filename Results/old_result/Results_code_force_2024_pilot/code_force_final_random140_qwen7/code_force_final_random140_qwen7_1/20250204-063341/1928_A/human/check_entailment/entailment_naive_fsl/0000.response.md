Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where either \(a\) or \(b\) is equal to 1, which is a critical edge case. According to the problem, a \(1 \times 1\) rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, so the output should be "No". However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for such cases.

For example, if we input `1 1`, the program should output "No" but instead, it outputs "YES" due to the conditions not covering this specific edge case.
