### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program has issues with the conditions used to determine when a rectangle cannot be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure we understand why it is incorrect and how to fix it.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for "NO" Output**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd.
     - If both dimensions are odd, it prints "NO". This is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle without a 90-degree rotation.
   - The program also checks if either `a / 2` equals `b` and `b` is odd, or if `b / 2` equals `a` and `a` is odd.
     - This condition is incorrect because it does not cover all cases where a rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be split into two 2x3 rectangles, and those can form a 4x3 rectangle.

3. **Conditions for "YES" Output**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES".
     - This means the program assumes that if the previous conditions are not met, a new rectangle can always be formed. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, a 2x2 rectangle can be split into two 1x2 rectangles, but those cannot form a new distinct rectangle.

### Correct Conditions for "NO" Output:

To correctly determine if a rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle, we need to consider the following:
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the rectangle cannot be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, the rectangle can potentially be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

Here is the corrected logic:
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "NO".
- If either `a` or `b` is even, print "YES".

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the conditions used to determine when a rectangle cannot be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle. The corrected program addresses these issues by checking if either dimension is even, which allows for the formation of a new distinct rectangle.

**Final: True**
