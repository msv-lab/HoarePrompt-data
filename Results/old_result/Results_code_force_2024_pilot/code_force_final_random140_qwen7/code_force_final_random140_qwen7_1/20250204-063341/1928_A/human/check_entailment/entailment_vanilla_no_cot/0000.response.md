Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The program checks if both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO'. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine whether another rectangle can be formed. For example, a \(3 \times 3\) rectangle can indeed be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and reformed into a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle.

2. **Specific Even Dimensions Check**: The second part of the check is more problematic. It checks if either \(a/2 == b\) and \(b\) is odd, or \(b/2 == a\) and \(a\) is odd. This condition is overly restrictive and does not cover all cases where another rectangle can be formed. For instance, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and reformed into a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, but the current logic would incorrectly mark it as 'NO'.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should consider the following logic:
- A rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles and reformed into another rectangle unless the original dimensions are such that no further meaningful division is possible.
- Specifically, if either dimension is 1, no other rectangle can be formed. 
- For other cases, the ability to form another rectangle depends on the possibility of cutting the rectangle into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # If either dimension is 1, no other rectangle can be formed
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This version correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the program outputs the correct result for all given test cases.
