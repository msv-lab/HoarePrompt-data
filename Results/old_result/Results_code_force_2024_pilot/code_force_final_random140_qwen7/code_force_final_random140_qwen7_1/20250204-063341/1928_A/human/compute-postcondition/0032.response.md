Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, i is equal to n - 1, a and b are the last two integers entered by the user after converting them to integers.**

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `n` remains unchanged as well since it is used to control the loop's execution but is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last two integers entered by the user during the final iteration of the loop, as these are the only variables that are assigned values inside the loop body.
