Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state describes that `t` is a positive integer within the range of \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but its exact value is not relevant to the print statement. Similarly, `n` must be greater than 0, but again, its exact value is not needed for the print statement. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2, and `a` and `b` are the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively, after being converted to integers. However, the print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, or any other variables. Therefore, the output is **YES**.
