### Reasoning:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the program indeed fails to handle certain cases properly. Let's break down the issues and provide a correct solution.

#### Issues in the Original Program:

1. **Incorrect Condition Checks**:
   - The program incorrectly prints "NO" when either `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd, or `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd. These conditions are overly restrictive and do not cover all cases where a new rectangle cannot be formed.
   
2. **Missing Cases**:
   - The program does not account for cases where one dimension is even and the other is odd, and the rectangle can still be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

#### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If both dimensions are odd, the rectangle cannot be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, the rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.
- If both dimensions are even, the rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Condition for "NO" Output**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints "NO". This is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

3. **Condition for "YES" Output**:
   - If at least one of the dimensions is even, the program prints "YES". This covers all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: \(1 \times 1\)
  - Both dimensions are odd, so it correctly prints "NO".

- **Test Case 2**: \(2 \times 1\)
  - One dimension is even, so it correctly prints "YES".

- **Test Case 3**: \(2 \times 6\)
  - One dimension is even, so it correctly prints "YES".

- **Test Case 4**: \(3 \times 2\)
  - One dimension is even, so it correctly prints "YES".

- **Test Case 5**: \(2 \times 2\)
  - Both dimensions are even, so it correctly prints "YES".

- **Test Case 6**: \(2 \times 4\)
  - One dimension is even, so it correctly prints "YES".

- **Test Case 7**: \(6 \times 3\)
  - Both dimensions are even, so it correctly prints "YES".

### Conclusion:

The corrected program handles all cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
