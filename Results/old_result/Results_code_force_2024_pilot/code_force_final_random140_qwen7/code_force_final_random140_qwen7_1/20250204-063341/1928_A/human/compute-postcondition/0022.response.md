Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer, `b` is the second integer entered by the user after converting it to an integer. The if condition checks if either `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or `b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`. If the condition is true, the program does something (not specified in the given postconditions). If the condition is false, the program also does something (not specified in the given postconditions).**
