Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `a` is the first integer entered.
- `b` is the second integer entered.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is even.
- Either `a / 2 == b` with `b` being odd or `b / 2 == a` with `a` being odd.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
