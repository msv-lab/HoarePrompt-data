State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head involves the variable `i`, which is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
2. The loop head also involves the variable `n`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
3. Since `i` is initialized to 0, the loop will start with `i` being 0.
4. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), as the `range(n)` function will not generate any values if `n` is 0 or negative.
5. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop's execution and its value does not affect whether the loop runs or not, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
