Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `sums` remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `ans` now contains one additional element, which is the updated value of `sums`.
