Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. However, the actual values of `sums` and the elements in the list `a` are not provided, so we cannot specify the exact numerical value of `sums` or `ans`. The only changes are that `sums` is updated according to the given formula, and `ans` now contains the updated value of `sums`. All other variables remain in their initial conditions except for `i` which is incremented by 2.
