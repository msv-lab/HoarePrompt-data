Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums` + `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])]`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` (which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]))` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was previously containing the value of `sums`, now it will contain the value of `sums` plus the new value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
