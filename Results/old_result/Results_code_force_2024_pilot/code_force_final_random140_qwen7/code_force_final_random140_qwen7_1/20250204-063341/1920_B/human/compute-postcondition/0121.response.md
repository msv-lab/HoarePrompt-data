Output State: **`sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`, `i` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The variable `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
