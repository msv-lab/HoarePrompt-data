Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `i`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
