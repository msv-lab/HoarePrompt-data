Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sums` holds the updated value, `ans` contains the intermediate values up to the current iteration.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, `sums`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
