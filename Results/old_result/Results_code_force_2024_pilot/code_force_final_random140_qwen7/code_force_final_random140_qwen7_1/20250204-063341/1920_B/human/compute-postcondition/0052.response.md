Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `sums` holds the updated value, `ans` contains the intermediate values up to the current iteration.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
