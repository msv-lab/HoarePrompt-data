Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sums + a[0]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is currently `sums + a[0]`, it adds this value to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
