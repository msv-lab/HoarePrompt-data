Output State: **`i` is within the range 0 to `k`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. If `i` is 0, `sums` is initially set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For subsequent iterations, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value.**

This output state describes the final condition of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will range from 0 to `k` inclusive, and `ans` will be a list of length `k + 1`, each element representing the value of `sums` at the end of each iteration of the loop.
