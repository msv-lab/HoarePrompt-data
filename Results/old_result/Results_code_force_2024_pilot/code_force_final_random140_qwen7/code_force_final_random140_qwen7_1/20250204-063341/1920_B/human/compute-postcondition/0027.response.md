Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding the element `a[i - 1]` to it. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `sums` is expressed as `sums + a[i - 1]`.
