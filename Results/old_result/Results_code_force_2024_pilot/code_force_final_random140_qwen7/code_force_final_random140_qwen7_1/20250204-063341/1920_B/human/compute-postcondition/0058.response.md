Output State: **`i` is within the range 0 to k, currently 0; `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`; `ans` now contains the value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is already defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, appending it to `ans` means `ans` now holds this value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
