Postcondition: `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]`. `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`.
