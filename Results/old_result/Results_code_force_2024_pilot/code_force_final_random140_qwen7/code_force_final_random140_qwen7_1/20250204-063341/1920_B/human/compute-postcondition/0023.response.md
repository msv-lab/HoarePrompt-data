Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `sums` is calculated based on the current values of `sum1` and `a[:x + 1]`. The list `ans` is updated to contain this new value of `sums`.
