Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is `sums`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

This means that the variable `i` remains within its original range from 1 to `k`. The variable `ans` is now a list that includes its previous elements plus one new element, which is the current value of `sums`. The value of `sums` is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `-2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
