Output State: The loop will execute exactly `k + 1` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `k`. After all iterations, `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements. 

- If `i == 0`, the first element in `ans` will be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- For each subsequent iteration where `i + x - 1 < n`, the next element in `ans` will be the previous element plus `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- For each iteration where `i + x - 1 >= n`, the next element in `ans` will be the previous element plus `a[i - 1]`.

In summary, `ans` will contain the sequence of sums calculated according to the conditions specified in the loop, starting from `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` when `i == 0`, and updating based on the conditions for each subsequent iteration.
