Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `sums` is `sums + a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding `a[i-1]` to it. Given that `i` was initially 0, `i-1` becomes -1. However, since list indices cannot be negative, this implies that the code intended to add `a[0]` to `sums`. After executing the line, `i` is incremented by 1 (though not shown in the code snippet, it's implied from the precondition that `i + x - 1 >= n` remains true), making `i` equal to 1. The value of `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The updated value of `sums` is `sums + a[0]`.
