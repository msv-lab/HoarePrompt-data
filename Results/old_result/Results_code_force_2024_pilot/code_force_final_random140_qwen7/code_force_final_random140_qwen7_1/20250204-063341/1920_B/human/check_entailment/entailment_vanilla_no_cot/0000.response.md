Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Removals and Negations:**
   - The program sorts the array in descending order and then tries to calculate the maximum possible sum by considering different scenarios of removals and negations. However, this approach does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.
   - Specifically, the logic inside the loop for calculating `sums` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that removing elements and negating elements can be done independently without considering the constraints and the optimal strategy.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The variable `sums` is initialized outside the loop but reused incorrectly within the loop. This leads to incorrect calculations.
   - The condition checks and updates of `sums` do not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented:**
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice removing the smallest elements first and Bob negating the largest elements he can within his limit. The current implementation does not capture this strategy.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following steps:
1. Alice should remove the smallest elements to minimize the negative impact on the sum.
2. Bob should negate the largest elements he can to minimize the sum further.
3. Calculate the sum after these optimal moves.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob negates x largest elements
        a = [-a[i] if i < x else a[i] for i in range(len(a))]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the largest elements, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
