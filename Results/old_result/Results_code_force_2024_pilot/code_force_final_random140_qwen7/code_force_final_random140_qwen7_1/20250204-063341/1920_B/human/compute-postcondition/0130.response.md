Output State: **`ans` contains `sums`, `i` is at least 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The initial state of `sums` is given as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, which means `sums` is calculated from these values but is now added to the list `ans`.
