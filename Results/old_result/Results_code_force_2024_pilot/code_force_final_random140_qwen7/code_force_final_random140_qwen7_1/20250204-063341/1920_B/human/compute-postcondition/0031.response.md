Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated according to the following rules: if `i == 0`, then `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`; otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.
