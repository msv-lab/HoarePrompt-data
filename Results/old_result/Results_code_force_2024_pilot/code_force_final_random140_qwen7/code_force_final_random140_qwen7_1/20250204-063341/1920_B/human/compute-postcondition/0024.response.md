Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since the exact values of `sum1` and `a` are not specified, `sums` remains as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `ans` now contains one additional element, which is the updated value of `sums`.
