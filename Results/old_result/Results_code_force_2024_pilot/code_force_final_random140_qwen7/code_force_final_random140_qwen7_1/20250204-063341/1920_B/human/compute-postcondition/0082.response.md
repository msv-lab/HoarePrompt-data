Postcondition: `i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list. If `i` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is updated to contain the value of `sums` appended with `sums`, and `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]`.
