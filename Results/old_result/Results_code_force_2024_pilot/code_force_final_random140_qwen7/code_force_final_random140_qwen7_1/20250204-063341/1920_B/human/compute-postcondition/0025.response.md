Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `sums` is included in the list `ans`.
