Postcondition: `i` is at least 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `i == 0`, then `ans` contains `sums`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` contains the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`.
