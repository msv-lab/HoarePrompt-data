Output State: **`ans` is an empty list, `i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as an empty list. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain unchanged from their initial state.
