Postcondition: `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated according to the following rules: if `i == 0`, then `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]`. `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`, and `ans` has an additional element which is the updated value of `sums`.
