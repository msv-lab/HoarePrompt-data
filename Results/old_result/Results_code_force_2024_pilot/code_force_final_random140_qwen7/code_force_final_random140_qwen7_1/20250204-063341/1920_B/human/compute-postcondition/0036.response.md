Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`.**

This means that the value of `i` remains `i + 2`, `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The variable `sums` is updated according to the formula provided, and `ans` is a list containing this updated value of `sums`.
