Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x` respectively. The initial state of `i` being within the range 1 to `k` and `ans` being a list containing `k + 1` elements remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values of the variables are as described in the output state.
