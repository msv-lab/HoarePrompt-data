Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The variables `i` and `x` are assumed to be within their respective ranges, and `a` is a list from which the elements are being accessed. The other variables (`ans` and `sums`) remain unchanged except for the updated value of `sums`.
