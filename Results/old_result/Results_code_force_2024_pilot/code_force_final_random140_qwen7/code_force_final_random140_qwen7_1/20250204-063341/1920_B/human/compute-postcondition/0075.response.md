Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**.

This means that the value of `sums` has been updated according to the formula `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `ans` still contains the original value of `sums` before the update.
