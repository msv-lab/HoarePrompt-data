Output State: **`ans` contains the value of `sums`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `i` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, `ans` now contains the calculated value of `sums`, while `sums` retains its original formula and `i` stays as 0.
