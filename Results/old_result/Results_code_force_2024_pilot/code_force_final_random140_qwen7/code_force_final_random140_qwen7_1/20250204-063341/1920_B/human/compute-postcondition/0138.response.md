Output State: The final state of the loop will have `i` equal to `k + 1`, `x` as an integer, `n` as an integer, and `k` being greater than or equal to 2. The list `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` will be the cumulative sum calculated according to the rules defined in the loop body, starting from `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` when `i == 0`, and then updating `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or simply adding `a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will hold a sequence of cumulative sums based on the given conditions, starting with the initial calculation and updating it according to the loop's logic until `i` reaches `k + 1`.
