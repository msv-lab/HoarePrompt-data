Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k + 1`. The variable `sums` will hold the final value after all updates based on the conditions provided in the loop. The list `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop from `i = 0` to `i = k`. The maximum value among these elements will be printed as the final output.

In natural language, this means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `ans` will store all intermediate results of the variable `sums` calculated for each value of `i` from 0 to `k`. The final output will be the maximum value found in this list `ans`.
