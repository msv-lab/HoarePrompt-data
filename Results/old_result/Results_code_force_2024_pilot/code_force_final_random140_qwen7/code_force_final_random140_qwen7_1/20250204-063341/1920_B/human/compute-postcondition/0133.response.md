Output State: **`i` is at least 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

The code updates the `sums` variable by adding the element `a[i - 1]` to its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `sums`, it is represented as `sums + a[i - 1]`. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
