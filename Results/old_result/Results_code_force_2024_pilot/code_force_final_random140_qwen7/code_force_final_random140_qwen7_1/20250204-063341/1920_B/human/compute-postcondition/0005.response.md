Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of the integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are replaced by the integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. The list `a` remains unchanged and is still a reversed list of the integers from the input. The variables `n`, `k`, and `x` are replaced by the integer values from the input split by spaces, but their specific values are not relevant to the updated state of `a` and `sum1`.
