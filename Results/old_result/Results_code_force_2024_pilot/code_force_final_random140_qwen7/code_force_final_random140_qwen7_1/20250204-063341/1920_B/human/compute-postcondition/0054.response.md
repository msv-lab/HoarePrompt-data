Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(k + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `k`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `a`: A reversed sorted list of integers.
   - `i`: Initially set to `k + 2`.
   - `x`: An input integer.
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `sum1`: Sum of all elements in `a`.
   - `sums`: Holds the updated value (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `ans`: An empty list.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `k`. Given that `i` is initially `k + 2`, it is currently outside this range.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To allow the loop to execute, `i` must be brought into the range `0` to `k`. This requires adjusting `i` to be within this range.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`a`, `x`, `n`, `sum1`, `sums`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be within the range `0` to `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be within the range 0 to k**
