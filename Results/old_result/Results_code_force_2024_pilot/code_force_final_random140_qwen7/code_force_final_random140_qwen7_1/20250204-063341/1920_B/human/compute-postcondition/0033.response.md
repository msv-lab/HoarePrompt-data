Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `x` is an integer
- `n` is an integer
- `sums` is updated according to the given rules
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(k + 1):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 again, so `i` will become `i + 2`.

2. **Variables `x`, `n`, `sums`, and `ans`:**
   - These variables are not directly modified within the loop head but are part of the loop body.
   - Therefore, their values remain unchanged for the purpose of adjusting the loop head state.

### Updated States for the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 2` (since it was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `x`, `n`, `sums`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated according to the given rules, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**
