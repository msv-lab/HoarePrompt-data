Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and the value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[-1] - 2 * a[x - 1]`. However, since `a[-1]` is not defined (assuming `a` is an array or list), the expression should be interpreted as `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]` based on the provided conditions. The other variables remain unchanged.
