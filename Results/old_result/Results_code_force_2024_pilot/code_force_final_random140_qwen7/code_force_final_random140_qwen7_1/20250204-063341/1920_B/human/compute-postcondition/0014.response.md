Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and the value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was previously defined as `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, the new value of `ans` is a list containing this value. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`) remain unchanged.
