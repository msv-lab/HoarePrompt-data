Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` and `n` remain unchanged, `sums` holds the updated value, `ans` contains the intermediate values up to the current iteration.**

The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial value of `i` is `k + 2`, which remains unchanged because the code does not modify `i`. The variables `x` and `n` are unchanged as they are reassigned but not redefined. The `sums` and `ans` variables retain their previous values since they are not mentioned in the code.
