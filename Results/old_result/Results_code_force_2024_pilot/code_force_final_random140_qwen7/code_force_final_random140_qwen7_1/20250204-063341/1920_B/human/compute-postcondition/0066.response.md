Output State: **`sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value, `i` is within the range 0 to `k`, and `i` is not equal to 0, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The line `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the element `a[i - 1]` to its current value. The conditions involving `i`, `k`, and the comparison with `n` remain unchanged as the code does not affect these variables.
