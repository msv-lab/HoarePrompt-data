Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated state of `a` being sorted, while the rest of the variables retain their initial conditions.
