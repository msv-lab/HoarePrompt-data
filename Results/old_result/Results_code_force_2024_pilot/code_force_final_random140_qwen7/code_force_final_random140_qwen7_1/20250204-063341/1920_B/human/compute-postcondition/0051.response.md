Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sums` holds the updated value, `ans` contains the intermediate values up to the current iteration.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a` in-place. This means that the order of elements in `a` is flipped, but all other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, `sums`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
