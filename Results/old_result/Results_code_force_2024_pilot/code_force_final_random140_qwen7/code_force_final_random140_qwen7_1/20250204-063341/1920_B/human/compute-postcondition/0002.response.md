Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are replaced by the integer values from the input split by spaces, and `a` is a list containing these integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. As a result, the original values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are replaced by the new integer values from the input, and a new list `a` is created containing these integers.
