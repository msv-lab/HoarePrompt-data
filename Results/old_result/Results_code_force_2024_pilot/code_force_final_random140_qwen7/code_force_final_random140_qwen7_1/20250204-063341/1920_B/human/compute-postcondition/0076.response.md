Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `sums` is updated according to the given formula. The list `ans` now contains the previous value of `sums` plus the new value calculated from `a[i - 1]` and `a[i + x - 1]`.
