Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is a variable, and `ans` is a list. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]` and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]` and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[0]`.
