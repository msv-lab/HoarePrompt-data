Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the game rules and computes the optimal sum of the array elements.

1. **Input Reading**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**:
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` for each test case.
   - It reads the array `a` and sorts it in descending order.
3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The initial sum of the array (`sum1`) is calculated.
   - A list `ans` is initialized to store intermediate sums.
   - The main loop iterates from `0` to `k` inclusive:
     - For `i = 0`, it calculates a sum by removing the smallest `x+1` elements twice (effectively removing them once).
     - For other values of `i`, it updates the sum by adding the `i-th` largest element and subtracting twice the `(i + x)-th` largest element.
     - If `i + x - 1` exceeds the length of the array, it simply adds the `i-th` largest element to the sum.
4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The maximum value from the list `ans` is computed and printed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code appears to correctly simulate the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob:
- Alice removes up to `k` elements to maximize the remaining sum.
- Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by `-1` to minimize the sum.

The code handles all edge cases and correctly computes the optimal sum for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
