Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `sums` holds the updated value, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables with their respective values and adds that `ans` is now an empty list.
