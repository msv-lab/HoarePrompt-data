Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n; and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `x` and `n` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `sums` will hold the final value after all updates based on the conditions provided in the loop. `ans` will be a list containing all the intermediate values of `sums` updated in each iteration of the loop.

This means that `ans` will have `k + 1` elements, with each element representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is within the range 0 to `k`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. If `i` is 0, `sums` is initially set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For subsequent iterations, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `k + 1` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `k`. After all iterations, `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements. 

- If `i == 0`, the first element in `ans` will be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- For each subsequent iteration where `i + x - 1 < n`, the next element in `ans` will be the previous element plus `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- For each iteration where `i + x - 1 >= n`, the next element in `ans` will be the previous element plus `a[i - 1]`.

In summary, `ans` will contain the sequence of sums calculated according to the conditions specified in the loop, starting from `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` when `i == 0`, and updating based on the conditions for each subsequent iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
