Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `k` inclusive.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `k`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is within the range `1` to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list.
   - If `i` is `0`, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is updated to contain the value of `sums` appended with `sums`, and `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently within the range `1` to `k`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - We need to check if `i + 1` is still within the range `0` to `k`.

Given that `i` is currently within the range `1` to `k`, the next value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) will still be within the range `0` to `k` because `i` was at most `k` and adding `1` to it will bring it to `k + 1`, but since the loop runs up to `k`, `i + 1` will be within the valid range.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `i + 1`.

**State:**
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `ans` remains the same unless the condition `i + x - 1 >= n` is met, in which case `ans` would be updated.
- `sums` remains the same unless the condition `i + x - 1 >= n` is met, in which case `sums` would be updated.

Since no specific values for `ans` or `sums` are provided, we assume they remain unchanged unless explicitly updated by the loop body.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k`, `ans` is a list, `sums` remains unchanged unless updated by the loop body.**
