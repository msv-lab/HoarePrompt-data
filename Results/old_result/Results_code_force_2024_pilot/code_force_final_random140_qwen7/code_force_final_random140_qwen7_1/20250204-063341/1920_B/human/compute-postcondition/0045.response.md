Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `x` and `n` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `sums` will hold the final value after all updates based on the conditions provided in the loop. `ans` will be a list containing all the intermediate values of `sums` updated in each iteration of the loop.

This means that `ans` will have `k + 1` elements, with each element representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop from `i = 0` to `i = k`.
