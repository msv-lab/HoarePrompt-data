Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated according to the formula `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` using the formula `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was set to `i + 2` in the initial state but no further operations are performed on it. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they were just mentioned in the initial state without any operations being performed on them. The variable `ans` is updated to contain the new value of `sums` after applying the formula.
