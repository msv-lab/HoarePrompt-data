Postcondition: **`i`, `x`, `n`, and `k` are integers where `i` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`, and `ans` contains the value of `sums`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `sums + a[i - 1]` followed by `sums`.**
