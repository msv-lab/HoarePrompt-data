Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described algorithm. According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that the score is increased by \(\min(x, y)\). However, the program simply sums every second element in the list, which does not necessarily maximize the score.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2
2 4 6 8
```
The program would output:
```
6
```
But the optimal strategy would be to pair the smallest numbers together:
- First move: \(2\) and \(4\), score = \(2\)
- Second move: \(6\) and \(8\), score = \(6\)
- Total score = \(2 + 6 = 8\)

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to maximize the score.
