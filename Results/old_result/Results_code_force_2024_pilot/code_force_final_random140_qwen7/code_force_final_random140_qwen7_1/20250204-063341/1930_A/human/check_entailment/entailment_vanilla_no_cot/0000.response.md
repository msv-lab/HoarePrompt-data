Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program sums every other element in the list starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This approach does not necessarily maximize the score as defined by the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, we should sort the array and then sum up the elements at even indices (after sorting), which corresponds to pairing the smallest available numbers together in each step. Here's why this works:

- By sorting the array, we ensure that when we pair the smallest numbers, their minimum value is maximized.
- Summing the elements at even indices (after sorting) effectively pairs the smallest numbers together, ensuring the maximum possible score.

Let's modify the function to correctly implement this logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()  # Sort the array
        score = sum(A[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))  # Sum elements at even indices
        print(score)
        t = t - 1
```

This corrected version will give the correct maximum final score as per the problem statement.
