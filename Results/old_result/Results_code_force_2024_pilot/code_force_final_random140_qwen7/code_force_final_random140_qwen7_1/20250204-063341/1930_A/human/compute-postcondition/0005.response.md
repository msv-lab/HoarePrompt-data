Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 4999, `n` is an input integer, A is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it an integer between 0 and 4999 (since it was originally between 1 and 5000). The values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged.
