Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function, then assigns the resulting list to `A`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
