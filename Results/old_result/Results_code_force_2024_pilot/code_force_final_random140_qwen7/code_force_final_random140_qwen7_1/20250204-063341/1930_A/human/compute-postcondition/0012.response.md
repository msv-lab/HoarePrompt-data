Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `A` remain unchanged. The initial value of `n` (which was an input integer) is now reassigned to the new input integer.
