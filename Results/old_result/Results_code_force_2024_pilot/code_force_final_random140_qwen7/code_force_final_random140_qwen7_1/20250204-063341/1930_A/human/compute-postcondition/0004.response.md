Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum(A[::2]))
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- `A[::2]`: This slice notation means every second element of the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).

- `sum(A[::2])`: This function calculates the sum of the elements selected by the slice `A[::2]`.

### Determining the Output:

- Since the exact values of `n` and the input string are not specified, we cannot determine the exact elements of `A`. However, we know that `A` is a list of integers obtained by splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

- The `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement will print the sum of every second element in the list `A`.

### Final Output:

Given the above analysis, the output will be the sum of every second element in the list `A`.

Output: **the sum of every second element in the list A**
