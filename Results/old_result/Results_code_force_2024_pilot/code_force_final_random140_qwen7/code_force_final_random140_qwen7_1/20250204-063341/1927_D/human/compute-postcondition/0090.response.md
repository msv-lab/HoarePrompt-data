Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`, `p` is now equal to `x`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `p = x` simply assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `j`, or `i`. The condition for `j` remains unchanged, and `i` is still increased by 1. Therefore, the only change is that `p` is now equal to `x`.
