You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        R()
        a = [0]
        p = i = j = 0
        for x in R():
            j = (j, i)[x != p]
            a += (j,)
            p = x
            i += 1
        (q,) = R()
        while q:
            q -= 1
            (l, r) = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of queries on an array `a`. It first reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads additional parameters and constructs an array `a` based on certain rules. Then, it processes `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it checks if the element at index `r` in array `a` is greater than or equal to `l`. If so, it prints the element at index `r` and the index `r`. Otherwise, it prints `-1` twice. After processing all queries, the function outputs the results of these queries.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array `a` itself, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes some variables: `p` (previous element), `i` (index), `j` (index of last different element).
   - It iterates over the array `a` and updates `j` to be the index of the last different element seen so far.
   - It constructs an array `a` where `a[r]` will store the index of the last different element in the subarray from `1` to `r`.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it prints either the indices of two different elements within the range `[l, r]` or `(-1, -1)` if no such pair exists.
   - The logic inside the query handling seems to be flawed because it checks if `a[r]` is less than `l`, which doesn't make sense in the context of finding different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

### Detailed Issues:

1. **Array Construction:**
   - The construction of the array `a` is intended to store the index of the last different element. However, the way it is constructed might not correctly capture the desired behavior. Specifically, the logic `j = (j, i)[x != p]` and `a += (j,)` needs to be re-evaluated.

2. **Query Handling Logic:**
   - The condition `if a[r] < l` is incorrect. Instead, we should check if there are any different elements between `l` and `r`. The current logic does not properly handle this.

### Corrected Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we can use a more straightforward approach:
1. Use a set to keep track of unique elements in the current range.
2. For each query, check if the set has more than one unique element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split)
    
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(next(R()))
        a = list(map(int, next(R())))
        q = int(next(R()))
        
        # Process each query
        for _ in range(q):
            (l, r) = map(int, next(R()))
            unique_elements = set(a[l-1:r])
            if len(unique_elements) > 1:
                print(l, l + 1)  # Print any two different indices
            else:
                print(-1, -1)
        
        if t > 0:
            print()  # Separate output for different test cases

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in constructing and using the array `a` and the incorrect condition in the query handling. The corrected version uses a set to track unique elements and handles queries correctly.
