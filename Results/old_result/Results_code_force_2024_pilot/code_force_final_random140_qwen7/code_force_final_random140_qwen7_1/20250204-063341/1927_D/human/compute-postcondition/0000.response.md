Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; the array `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= n; `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes input from the user and splits it into a tuple of integers. However, no variables are assigned or modified by this lambda function, so the initial values of the variables remain unchanged.
