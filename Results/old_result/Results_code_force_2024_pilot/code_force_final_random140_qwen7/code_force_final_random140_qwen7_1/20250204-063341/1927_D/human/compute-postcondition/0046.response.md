Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0], `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` updates the list `a` by appending the value of `j` to it. Initially, `a` is `[0]`. Since `j` is 0, appending 0 to `[0]` results in `[0, 0]`. The values of `t`, `p`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
