Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. This means if the original value of `q` was `n`, then `q = n - 1`.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`. Since no specific value is given, we'll keep it as `R()` for now.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`. Again, since no specific value is given, we'll keep it as `R()` for now.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The expression `a[r]` refers to an element in the list `a` at index `r`.
   - The condition `a[r] < l` checks if the element at index `r` in list `a` is less than the value `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, then the expression evaluates to `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, then the expression evaluates to `[-1] * 2`, which is a list containing two `-1`s.

Given that `a` is not explicitly defined, let's assume `a` is a list where `a[r]` is the element at index `r` in the list. Since `r` is a value returned by `R()`, it could be any valid index within the bounds of `a`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `a`, `l`, and `r`, we can only describe the output based on the logical conditions.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `a[r] < l`:**
   - The output will be `(a[r], r)`.
   - Since `a[r]` is an element from the list `a` at index `r`, and `r` is a value returned by `R()`, the output will be a tuple containing the element and the index.

2. **If `a[r] >= l`:**
   - The output will be `[-1, -1]`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise [-1, -1]**
