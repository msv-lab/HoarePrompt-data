Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i)[x != p]], `p` is x, `i` is 2, `j` is (j, i)[x != p]**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `a`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
