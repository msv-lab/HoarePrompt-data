Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i), 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]], `p` is new_x, `i` is 4, `q` is the value of `new_x` generated by `R()` and `j` is (j, i)[new_x != p].**

Explanation: The code `q, = R()` calls the function `R()` and assigns the single value returned by `R()` to the variable `q`. Since `R()` generates a value, `q` will hold the value of `new_x` generated by `R()`. The list `a` remains unchanged except for the addition of `(j, i)[new_x != p]` from the last iteration, making it `[0, 0, (j, i), 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]]`. The variable `t` remains unchanged at 0, `i` remains at 4, `p` holds the value of `new_x`, and `j` remains as `(j, i)[new_x != p]`.
