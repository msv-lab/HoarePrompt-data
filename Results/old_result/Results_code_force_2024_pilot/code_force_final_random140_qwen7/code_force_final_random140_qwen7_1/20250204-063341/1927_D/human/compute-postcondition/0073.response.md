Output State: **`q` is equal to `q-1`, `l` is the first value returned by R(), `r` is the second value returned by R().**

Explanation: The variable `q` was initially decreased by 1. The code then assigns the return values of the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the exact values returned by `R()` are not specified, they are represented as `l` and `r`. The value of `q` is updated to `q-1` due to the initial state.
