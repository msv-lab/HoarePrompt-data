The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer. A positive integer is non-zero, so no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer**
