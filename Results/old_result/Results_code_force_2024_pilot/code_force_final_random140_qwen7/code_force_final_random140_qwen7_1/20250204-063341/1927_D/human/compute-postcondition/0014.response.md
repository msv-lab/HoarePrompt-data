Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, `j` is equal to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is equal to `j`.**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` simply increments the value of `a` by the current value of `j`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `p`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state of `a` is increased by `j`, while the other variables retain their initial conditions described in the initial state.
