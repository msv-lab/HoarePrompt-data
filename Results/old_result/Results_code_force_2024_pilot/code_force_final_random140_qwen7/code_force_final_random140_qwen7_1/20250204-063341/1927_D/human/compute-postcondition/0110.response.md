Output State: **`q` is a positive integer - 1; `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()` which returns two values. These values are assigned to `l` and `r`. The initial state of `q` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `q` is still a positive integer - 1, and `l` and `r` take the values returned by the function `R()`.
