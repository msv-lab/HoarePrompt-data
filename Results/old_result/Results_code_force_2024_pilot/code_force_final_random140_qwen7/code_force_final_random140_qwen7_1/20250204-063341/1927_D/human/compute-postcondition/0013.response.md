Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, `j` is equal to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is equal to `j`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `j` the value of `i` if `x` is not equal to `p`, or keeps `j` as its original value if `x` is equal to `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
