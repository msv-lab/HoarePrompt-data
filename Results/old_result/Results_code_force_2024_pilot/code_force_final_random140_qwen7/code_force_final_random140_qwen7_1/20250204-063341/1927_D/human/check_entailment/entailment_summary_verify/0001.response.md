### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, including the flawed logic in constructing and using the array `a` and the incorrect condition in the query handling. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to process multiple test cases.
- For each test case, we have an array `a` and multiple queries.
- Each query defines a range `[l, r]` and requires us to find two indices `i` and `j` within this range such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we output `(-1, -1)`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads test cases, processes arrays, and handles queries.
- For each query, it checks if the element at index `r` in array `a` is greater than or equal to `l`. If so, it prints the element at index `r` and the index `r`. Otherwise, it prints `-1` twice.

#### Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then reads the length of the array `n`, the array `a` itself, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function initializes some variables: `p` (previous element), `i` (index), `j` (index of last different element).
   - It iterates over the array `a` and updates `j` to be the index of the last different element seen so far.
   - It constructs an array `a` where `a[r]` will store the index of the last different element in the subarray from `1` to `r`.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - The function checks if the element at index `r` in array `a` is greater than or equal to `l`.
   - If `a[r] >= l`, it prints the element at index `r` and the index `r`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1` twice.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Array Construction:**
   - The logic `j = (j, i)[x != p]` and `a += (j,)` is not correctly capturing the desired behavior. It seems to be tracking the last different element but not in a way that helps with the query handling.

2. **Query Handling Logic:**
   - The condition `if a[r] < l` is incorrect. Instead, we should check if there are any different elements between `l` and `r`. The current logic does not properly handle this.

#### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we can use a more straightforward approach:
1. Use a set to keep track of unique elements in the current range.
2. For each query, check if the set has more than one unique element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split)
    
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(next(R()))
        a = list(map(int, next(R())))
        q = int(next(R()))
        
        # Process each query
        for _ in range(q):
            (l, r) = map(int, next(R()))
            unique_elements = set(a[l-1:r])
            if len(unique_elements) > 1:
                print(l, l + 1)  # Print any two different indices
            else:
                print(-1, -1)
        
        if t > 0:
            print()  # Separate output for different test cases

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in constructing and using the array `a` and the incorrect condition in the query handling. The corrected version uses a set to track unique elements and handles queries correctly.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
