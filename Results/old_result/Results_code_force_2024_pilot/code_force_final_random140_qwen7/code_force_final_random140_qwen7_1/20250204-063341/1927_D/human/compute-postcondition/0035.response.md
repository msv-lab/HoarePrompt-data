Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration), `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`, `i` is the total number of iterations completed, `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()`, `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns the values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the function `R()` generates values, `l` and `r` now hold these new values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
