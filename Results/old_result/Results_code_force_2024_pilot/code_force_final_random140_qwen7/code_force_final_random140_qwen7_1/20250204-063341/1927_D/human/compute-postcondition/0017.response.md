Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `a` is increased by `j`
- `i` is increased by 2
- `x` is the next value provided by `R()`
- `p` is equal to `x`

### Loop Statement
```
for x in R():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `x` is taken from the generator `R()`.
- The loop condition is based solely on the availability of the next value from `R()`.
- No other variables in the loop head are directly affected by the loop itself; they remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body (which is omitted here).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `R()` provides a new value for `x`.
2. **Variables in Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`.

### Adjusting the State
- Since `x` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `x` is updated to the next value provided by `R()`.
- The values of `a`, `i`, and `p` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

### Final State
- `a` remains as it was increased by `j` in the previous iteration.
- `i` remains as it was increased by 2 in the previous iteration.
- `x` is updated to the next value provided by `R()`.
- `p` remains equal to `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 2, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`**
