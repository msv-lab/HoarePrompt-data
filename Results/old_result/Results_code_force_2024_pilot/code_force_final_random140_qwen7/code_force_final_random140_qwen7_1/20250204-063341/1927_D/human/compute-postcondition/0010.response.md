Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`, `x` is now equal to `p`, and `p` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The line `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. Since `x` must provide at least one value from `R()`, the value of `x` is now stored in `p`. The other variables (`a`, `j`) remain unchanged according to their previous conditions.
