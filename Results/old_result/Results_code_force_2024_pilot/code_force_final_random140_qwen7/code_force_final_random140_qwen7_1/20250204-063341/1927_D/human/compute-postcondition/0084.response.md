Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.**

Explanation: The code `a += j` increments the value of `a` by the current value of `j`. The value of `j` is determined by whether `x` is not equal to `p`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
