Output State: **`t` is non-zero - 1, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i)[new_x != p], 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]], `p` is new_x, `i` is 4, `q` is 0, `j` is (j, i)[new_x != p], `l` is the last value returned by R(), `r` is the last value returned by R(), `R()` is called and returns a value.**

Explanation: The code `R()` is called, which returns a value. This value is stored in both `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
