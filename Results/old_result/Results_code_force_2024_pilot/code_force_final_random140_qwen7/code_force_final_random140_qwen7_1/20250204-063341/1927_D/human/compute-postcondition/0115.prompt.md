Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= n, `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers, `t` is now the first element returned by the lambda function `R()`
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    R()
    a = [0]
    p = i = j = 0
    for x in R():
        j = (j, i)[x != p]
        a += j,
        p = x
        i += 1
    q, = R()
    while q:
        q -= 1
        l, r = R()
        print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer - 1, `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration), `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`, `i` is the total number of iterations completed, `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`, `q` is `q - 3`, `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()` in the third iteration, `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()` in the third iteration.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `q` will be reduced by the number of iterations, which is 3 in this case. The variables `l` and `r` will take the values generated by `R()` in the last iteration of the loop, as these values are updated each time through the loop. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `i`, `j`) retain their values from the final iteration of the loop since they are not modified within the loop body.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i), 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]], `p` is new_x, `i` is 4, `q` is 0, `j` is (j, i)[new_x != p], `l` is the last value returned by R(), `r` is the last value returned by R().

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `q` is greater than 0. After each iteration, `q` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop runs for 3 iterations, it will continue until `q` becomes 0. At this point, the loop terminates. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last values returned by the function `R()` during the final iteration of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `i`, `j`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states since they are not modified within the loop body.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `q` is 0, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing the sum of `j` for each iteration, where `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, `p` is the last value returned by `R()` before the assignment, and `i` is equal to the number of iterations.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `q` is greater than 0. After each iteration, `q` is decremented by 1. Since the loop outputs the state after 3 iterations, it means `q` has been decremented 3 times. Therefore, `q` will be 0 after all iterations. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last values returned by `R()` after the loop finishes, and `a` will contain the sum of `j` for each iteration, with `j` being the value of `i` from the last iteration.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
