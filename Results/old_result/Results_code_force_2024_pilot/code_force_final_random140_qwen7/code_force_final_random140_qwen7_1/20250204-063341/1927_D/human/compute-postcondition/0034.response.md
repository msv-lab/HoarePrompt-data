Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration), `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`, `i` is the total number of iterations completed, `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()`, `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`**.

Explanation: The value of `q` is decremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `q` is now `q - 1`. All other variables retain their initial or previously determined states.
