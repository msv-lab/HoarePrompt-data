Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (a positive integer), n (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive), a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive), and q (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive). For each query represented by two integers l and r (where 1 <= l < r <= n), the function returns a result based on the subarray a[l:r].**

- If the first case is fulfilled (none of the other cases apply), the function returns an error message indicating that the input parameters do not meet the specified constraints.
- If the second case is fulfilled (none of the other cases apply), the function returns "minor" if the age is between 0 and 18.
- If the third case is fulfilled (none of the other cases apply), the function returns "adult" if the age is greater than 18.
- If the fourth case is fulfilled (none of the other cases apply), the function returns an error message indicating that the age cannot be negative.
