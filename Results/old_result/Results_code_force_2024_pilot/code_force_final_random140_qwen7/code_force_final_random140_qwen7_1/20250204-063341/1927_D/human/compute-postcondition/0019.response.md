Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 2, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, `a` is increased by `j`.**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` increments the value of `a` by `j`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `p`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `a` is increased by `j`, while `i` is increased by 2, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, and `j` remains either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.
