Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 2, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `j` the value of either `j` or `i` based on the condition `x != p`. Since `x` is the next value provided by `R()` and `p` is equal to `x`, the condition `x != p` is always false. Therefore, `j` remains unchanged and keeps its previous value. All other variables (`a`, `i`, `x`, and `p`) retain their respective states from the initial state.
