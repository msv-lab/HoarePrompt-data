Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is increased by `j`
- `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`
- `p` is now equal to `x`
- `i` is increased by 1

### Loop Head:
```
for x in R():
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `x` is being iterated over by `R()`. There are no other variables directly mentioned in the loop head that are being modified within the loop itself (like `i` or `j`).

2. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `x` is the loop variable, its value changes with each iteration.
   - `p` is updated to the current value of `x` at the start of each iteration.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, but it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is determined based on the condition involving `x` and `p`, but it is not part of the loop head either.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value of `x` as it is the loop variable.

### New State:
- `a` is increased by `j`
- `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`
- `p` is now equal to the next value of `x` (let's call it `x_next`)
- `i` is increased by 1 (but this is not part of the loop head)

Since `x` is the loop variable, it will take the next value from the iterator `R()`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`, `p` is now equal to the next value of `x` (let's call it `x_next`), `i` is increased by 1**
