Reasoning:
- The provided code snippet does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array `a` and handling the queries is flawed.
- The array `a` is constructed in a way that does not ensure it contains distinct elements within the queried range. Instead, it seems to be accumulating some form of cumulative sum or index value, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
- For each query, the code checks if the element at index `r` is greater than or equal to `l` and prints the element at index `r` and `r`. However, this does not guarantee finding two different elements within the range `[l, r]`.
- The problem requires identifying two different elements within the specified range for each query. The current implementation does not ensure that such a pair exists or is found.

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
