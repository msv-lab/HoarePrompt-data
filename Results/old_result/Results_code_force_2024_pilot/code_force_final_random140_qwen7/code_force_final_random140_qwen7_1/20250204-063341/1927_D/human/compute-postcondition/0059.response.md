Output State: `t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i), 2, (j, i)[new_x != p]], `p` is new_x, `i` is 4, `j` is (j, i)[new_x != p]

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is 4 in this case. The list `a` will contain elements based on the logic inside the loop. Specifically, `j` is set to `(j, i)` if `x != p`, and it accumulates these values into the list `a`. The value of `p` will be the last `x` value from the range `R()`, and `j` will hold the value it had just before the last iteration of the loop.
