Output State: **`q` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list containing the sum of `j` for each iteration, `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, `l` is the last value returned by `R()`, `r` is the last value returned by `R()`, `p` is the last value returned by `R()` before the assignment, and `i` is equal to the number of iterations.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns the values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `q` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list containing the sum of `j` for each iteration, `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, `l` is the last value returned by `R()`, `r` is the last value returned by `R()`, `p` is the last value returned by `R()` before the assignment, and `i` is equal to the number of iterations.
