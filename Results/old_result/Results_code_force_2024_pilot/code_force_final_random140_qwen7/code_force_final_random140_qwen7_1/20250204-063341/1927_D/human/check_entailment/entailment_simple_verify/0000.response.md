### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to understand why the original assessment might be incorrect.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the array `a`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then processes each query.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)` and checks if there are two different elements within this range.
   - It uses the array `a` to store the cumulative count of the last differing index encountered so far.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with `[0]` and updated in the loop.
   - For each element `x` in the array, it updates `j` and appends it to `a`.
   - The value of `j` is set to `i` if `x` is different from `p` (the previous element).
   - The value of `p` is updated to `x`, and `i` is incremented.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it checks if `a[r]` is less than `l`. If true, it prints `[-1, -1]`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `(a[r], r)`.

#### Issues with the Original Assessment:
1. **Handling of Duplicates:**
   - The program correctly identifies the first occurrence of a duplicate element and sets `j` to `i` when `x` is different from `p`.
   - However, it does not ensure that the indices `i` and `j` are within the range `[l, r]`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Queries:**
   - The program does not filter out elements outside the query range `[l, r]` before checking for duplicates.
   - This can lead to incorrect results if the program finds a duplicate but the indices are outside the query range.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     5
     5
     1 1 2 1 1
     3
     1 5
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     2 3
     -1 -1
     -1 -1
     ```
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     2 3
     -1 -1
     1 3
     ```
   - The issue here is that the program returns `1 3` for the third query, which is incorrect because `1` and `3` are not within the range `[1, 3]`.

#### Corrected Logic:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the indices `i` and `j` are within the query range `[l, r]`. We can achieve this by maintaining a separate list to track the indices of the elements within the query range.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split)
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        _, n = R()
        a = list(R())
        _, q = R()
        queries = [tuple(R()) for _ in range(q)]
        
        for l, r in queries:
            indices = []
            for i in range(l-1, r):
                if a[i] not in indices:
                    indices.append(a[i])
            if len(indices) > 1:
                print(indices[0], indices[1])
            else:
                print(-1, -1)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The corrected logic ensures that the indices `i` and `j` are within the query range `[l, r]`, making the program correct.

**Final: True**
