Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer - 1. This means `t = 0`.
   - `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration).
   - `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`. Since `R()` generates a random integer, `p` is a random integer.
   - `i` is the total number of iterations completed. Since no iterations have been mentioned, let's assume it is 0 for now.
   - `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`. Since `i` is 0 and no previous `x` value is mentioned, `j` is also 0.
   - `q` is `q - 1`. Since `q` is not defined, let's assume it is a positive integer, so `q - 1` would be a positive integer minus one.
   - `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()`. So, `l` is a random integer.
   - `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`. So, `r` is a random integer.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

   Let's analyze this step by step:
   - `a` is `[0, j, j]`. Since `j` is 0, `a` becomes `[0, 0, 0]`.
   - `a[r]` will be the `r`-th element of the list `a`. Since `r` is a random integer, let's consider the possible values of `r`:
     - If `r = 0`, then `a[r] = 0`.
     - If `r = 1`, then `a[r] = 0`.
     - If `r = 2`, then `a[r] = 0`.

   - The expression `[a[r] < l]` will evaluate to `True` or `False` based on whether `a[r]` is less than `l`.
     - If `a[r] = 0` and `l` is any positive integer, then `a[r] < l` is `True`.
     - Therefore, `[a[r] < l]` will be `[True]`.

   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` will select the tuple `(a[r], r)` if `a[r] < l` is `True`, otherwise it will select `[-1] * 2` (which is `[-1, -1]`).

   - Since `a[r] < l` is `True`, the selected tuple is `(a[r], r)`. Given `a[r] = 0` and `r` is a random integer between 0 and 2, the tuple will be `(0, r)`.

   - The `*` operator will unpack the tuple, so the print statement will output `0` followed by `r`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0 r (where r is a random integer between 0 and 2)**
