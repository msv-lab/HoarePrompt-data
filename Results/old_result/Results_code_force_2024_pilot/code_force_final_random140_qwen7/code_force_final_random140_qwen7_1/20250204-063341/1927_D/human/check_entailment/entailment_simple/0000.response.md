Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code does not handle the queries as described in the problem statement.
2. The purpose of the code seems to be to build an array `a` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the value of the current element in the original array. However, this is not necessary for solving the problem.
3. For each query, the code attempts to find a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `l ≤ i, j ≤ r` and `a[i] ≠ a[j]`. Instead, it directly prints `a[r]` and `-1` without checking if `a[r]` falls within the query range `[l, r]`.
4. The logic inside the query handling part of the code is flawed. It checks if `a[r] < l`, which is not relevant to finding a pair of different elements within the query range. This condition should be replaced with a check to see if there are different elements within the range `[l, r]`.

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
