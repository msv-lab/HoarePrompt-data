Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 2, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was already increased by 1 in the initial state, it is now increased by 2. The values of `a`, `x`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
