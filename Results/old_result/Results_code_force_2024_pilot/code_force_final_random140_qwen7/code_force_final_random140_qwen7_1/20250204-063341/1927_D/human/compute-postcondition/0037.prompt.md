Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer - 1; `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` again (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration); `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`, `i` is the total number of iterations completed, `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`, `q` is the value generated by `R()`
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer - 1, `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration), `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`, `i` is the total number of iterations completed, `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()`, `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer - 1, `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration), `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`, `i` is the total number of iterations completed, `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()`, `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer - 1, `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration), `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`, `i` is the total number of iterations completed, `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()`, `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
