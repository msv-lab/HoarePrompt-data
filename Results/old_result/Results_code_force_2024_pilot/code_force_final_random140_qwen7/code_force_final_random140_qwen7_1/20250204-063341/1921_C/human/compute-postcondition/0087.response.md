Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the innermost if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the given code snippet, the values of `possible`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` remain unchanged.
