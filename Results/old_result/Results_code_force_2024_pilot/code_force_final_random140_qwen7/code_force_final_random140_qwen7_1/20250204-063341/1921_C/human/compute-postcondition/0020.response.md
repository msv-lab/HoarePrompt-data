Output State: **`i` is 2; `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`; `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)'; `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)' ; `possible` is `False`; `energy_cost` is now `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`**.

This means that the `energy_cost` variable has been updated to the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
