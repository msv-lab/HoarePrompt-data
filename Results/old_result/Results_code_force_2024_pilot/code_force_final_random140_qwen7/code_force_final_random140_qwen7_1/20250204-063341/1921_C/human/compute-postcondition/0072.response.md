Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `possible` remains `False`.**

Explanation: The code `f -= energy_cost` subtracts the value of `energy_cost` from `f`. Since `energy_cost` is defined as `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, the value of `f` is updated by subtracting this minimum value. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
