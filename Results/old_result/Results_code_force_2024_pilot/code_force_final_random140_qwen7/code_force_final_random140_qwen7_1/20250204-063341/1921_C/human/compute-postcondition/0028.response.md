Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)` - 1, `possible` is `False`**

Explanation: The code `energy_turn_off_on = b` simply reassigns the value of `energy_turn_off_on` to `b`. Since `b` was previously defined as `energy_turn_off_on`, this assignment does not change the value of `energy_turn_off_on`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
