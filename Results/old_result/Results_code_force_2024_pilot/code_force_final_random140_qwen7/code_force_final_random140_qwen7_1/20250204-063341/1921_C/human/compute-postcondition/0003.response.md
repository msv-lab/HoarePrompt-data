Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers entered by the user, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes an array `arr` with a leading zero and appends to it a list of integers split from the input. Since the input is taken from the user, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
