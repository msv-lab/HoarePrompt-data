Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `f` is decreased by `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`**.

This means that the value of `f` has been decreased by the minimum of `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
