Based on the initial state provided:

- `possible` is `False`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`.
- `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`.
- `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.
- `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`.
- `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)` after all iterations.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
```

Since `possible` is explicitly stated to be `False`, the expression `'YES' if possible else 'NO'` will evaluate to `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
