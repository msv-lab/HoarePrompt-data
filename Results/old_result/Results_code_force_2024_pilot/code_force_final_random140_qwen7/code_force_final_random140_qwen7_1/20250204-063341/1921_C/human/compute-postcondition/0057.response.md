Output State: **`i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`**

Explanation: The code updates `energy_cost` to be the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Given the initial conditions, `energy_cost` is now specifically set to the smaller of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
