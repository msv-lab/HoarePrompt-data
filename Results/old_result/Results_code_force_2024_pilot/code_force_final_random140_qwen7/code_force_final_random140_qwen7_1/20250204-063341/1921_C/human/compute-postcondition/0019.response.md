Output State: **`i` is 2; `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`; `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)'; `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)' ; `possible` is `False`**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `energy_turn_off_on` to `b`. Since `b` was already the value of `energy_turn_off_on` before this line, this assignment does not change the actual value stored in `energy_turn_off_on`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
