Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given state before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for _ in range(t)` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer. Since `t` is defined as `int(input())`, it will always be a positive integer if the input is valid.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`. It must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**.
