Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `possible` to `False`, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
