Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `time_diff` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_keep_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_cost` is undefined because the loop has ended, `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`, and `possible` is `False`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`. The loop breaks when `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost` for some iteration, setting `possible` to `False`. All other variables (`time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`) become undefined as they are no longer relevant after the loop ends. The value of `f` is updated to reflect the total energy cost accumulated during the loop iterations.
