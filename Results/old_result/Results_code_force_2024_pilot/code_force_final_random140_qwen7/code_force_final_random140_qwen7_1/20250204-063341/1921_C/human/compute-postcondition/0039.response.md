Output State: **`i` is `n`, `time_diff` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_keep_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_cost` is undefined because the loop has ended, `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`, and two new variables `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are defined as integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads four integers (`n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`) from input and assigns them to the respective variables. The other variables (`i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `possible`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation. Additionally, the expression for `f` is updated based on the input values but cannot be simplified further without knowing the actual values of `arr`.
