Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n + 1)`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `possible` is False
   - `i` is 2
   - `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`
   - `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`
   - `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`
   - `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - The condition `range(1, n + 1)` means the loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `time_diff` will be updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.
   - `energy_keep_on` will be updated to `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`.
   - `energy_turn_off_on` remains `b`.
   - `energy_cost` will be updated to `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`.
   - `f` will be updated to `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`.

5. **Check the `possible` Variable**:
   - The value of `possible` does not change based on the loop itself, so it remains `False`.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, and `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`**
