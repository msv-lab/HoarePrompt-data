#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. The list m contains n integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `possible` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), b)`, and `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]), b) for i in range(1, n+1))`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `possible` will be set to `False` because the condition `f <= energy_cost` was met at some point during the loop, causing the loop to break. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop runs from `1` to `n`. The `time_diff` will be the difference between `arr[n]` and `arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` will be `a` multiplied by `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` remains `b`, and `energy_cost` will be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Finally, `f` will be reduced by the sum of all `energy_cost` values over the iterations, which is the total energy consumed during the entire process.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers t, n, f, a, b, and a list m of n integers. It then calculates whether it is possible to turn off the device at certain times without the remaining energy falling below f. If it is possible, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
