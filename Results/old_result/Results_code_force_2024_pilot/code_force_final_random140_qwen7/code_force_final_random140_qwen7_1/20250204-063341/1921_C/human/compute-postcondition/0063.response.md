Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is within this range.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`.
   - `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`.
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.
   - `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`.
   - `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`.
   - `possible` is `False`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `3`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `3`.
   - `time_diff` will be updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.
   - `energy_keep_on` will be updated to `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`.
   - `energy_turn_off_on` remains `b`.
   - `energy_cost` will be updated to `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`.
   - `f` will be updated to `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`.
   - `possible` remains `False` unless the loop body changes it.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`**.
