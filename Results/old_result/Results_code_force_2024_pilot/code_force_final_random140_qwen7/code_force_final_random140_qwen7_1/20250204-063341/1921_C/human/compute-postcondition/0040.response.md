Output State: **`i` is `n`, `time_diff` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_keep_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_cost` is undefined because the loop has ended, `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`, `n` is an integer obtained from input, `f` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input and prepended with 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `arr` by taking space-separated integers as input, converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, and prepending 0 to the list. The values of `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers obtained from the input, and `arr` is updated to include the prepended 0.
