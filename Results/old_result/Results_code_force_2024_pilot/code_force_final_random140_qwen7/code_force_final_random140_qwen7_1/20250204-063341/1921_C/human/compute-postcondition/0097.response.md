Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional structure. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
