Output State: **`i` is 2; `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`; `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)'; `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)' ; `possible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `possible`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `f`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial states.
