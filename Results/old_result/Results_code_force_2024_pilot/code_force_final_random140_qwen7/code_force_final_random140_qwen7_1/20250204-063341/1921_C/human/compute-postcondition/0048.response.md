Output State: **`i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`.**

The variable `possible` is set to `False`, which means the condition being checked for `possible` being `True` was not met. All other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
