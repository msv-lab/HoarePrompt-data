Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to 1 (since `range(1, n + 1)` starts from 1).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Check the given state before the loop**: We know that `possible` is `True`, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers entered by the user, and `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, n+1)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and `n` is a positive integer.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
