Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads four space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in this operation. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), while `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` now hold the values of the integers entered by the user.
