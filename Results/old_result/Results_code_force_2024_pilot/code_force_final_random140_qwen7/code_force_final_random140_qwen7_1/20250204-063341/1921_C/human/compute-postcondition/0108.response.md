Postcondition: `possible` is still False, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `f` is updated to `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
