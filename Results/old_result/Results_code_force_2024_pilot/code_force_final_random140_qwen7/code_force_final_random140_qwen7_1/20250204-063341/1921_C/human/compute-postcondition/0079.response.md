Output State: **`possible` is True**

The variable `possible` is explicitly set to `True` in the given code snippet. All other variables (`arr`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `possible`) remain in their initial state, meaning `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, and `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `possible` are undefined. However, since only `possible` is updated, we focus on that change.
