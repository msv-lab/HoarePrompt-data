Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**.

This means that the initial value of `t` is replaced by the integer input from the user, and this integer is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^4. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
