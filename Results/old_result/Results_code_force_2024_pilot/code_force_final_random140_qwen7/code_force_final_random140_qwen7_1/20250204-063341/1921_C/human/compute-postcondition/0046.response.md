Output State: **`i` is 1; `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`; `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`**.

The code calculates the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on` and assigns it to `energy_cost`. Since `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])` and `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` will be the smaller of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged.
