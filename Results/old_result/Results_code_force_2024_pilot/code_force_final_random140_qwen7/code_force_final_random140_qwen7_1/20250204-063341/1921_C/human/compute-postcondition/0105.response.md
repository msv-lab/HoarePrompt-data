Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`; `energy_cost` is updated to be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`.**

This means that the value of `energy_cost` is now the smaller value between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
