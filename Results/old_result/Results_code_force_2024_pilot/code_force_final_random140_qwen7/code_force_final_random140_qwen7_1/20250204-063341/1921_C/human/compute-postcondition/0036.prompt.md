Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `possible` is True, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers entered by the user, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `possible` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2; `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`; `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`; `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)` - 1; `possible` is `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b) - 1`, `possible` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
