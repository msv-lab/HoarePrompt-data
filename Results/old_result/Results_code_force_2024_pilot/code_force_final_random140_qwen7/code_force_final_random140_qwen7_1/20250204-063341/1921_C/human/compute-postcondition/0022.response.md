Output State: **`i` is 2; `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`; `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`; `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`; `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)'; `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)' ; `possible` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or conditional block has been exited. All the other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
