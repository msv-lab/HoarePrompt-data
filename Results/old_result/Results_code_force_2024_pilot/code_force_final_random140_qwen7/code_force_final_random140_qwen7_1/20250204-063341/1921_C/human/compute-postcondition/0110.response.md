Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, and `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)` and we subtract `energy_cost` from `f`.**

Explanation: The code `f -= energy_cost` decreases the value of `f` by `energy_cost`. Since `energy_cost` is defined as `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`, `f` is now `f - min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
