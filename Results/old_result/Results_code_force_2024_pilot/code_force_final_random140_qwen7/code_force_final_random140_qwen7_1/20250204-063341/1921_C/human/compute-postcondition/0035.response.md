Output State: `i` is `n`, `possible` is `False`, `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(2, n + 1))`.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations from `1` to `n`. The variable `possible` remains `False` because the condition inside the loop broke it out before the end of the loop. The variable `f` is updated by subtracting the cumulative minimum energy cost (`min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)`) for each iteration from the initial value of `f`, but only starting from the second iteration (i.e., `i=2`), as the first iteration's cost was already deducted in the given example.
