Output State: **`i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `f` is reduced by `energy_cost`.**

Explanation: The variable `f` is decremented by the value of `energy_cost`, which is the minimum of `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
