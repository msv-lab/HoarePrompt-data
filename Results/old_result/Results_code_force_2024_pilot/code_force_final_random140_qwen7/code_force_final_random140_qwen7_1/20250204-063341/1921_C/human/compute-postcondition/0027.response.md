Output State: **`i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)`, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[1]), b)` - 1, `possible` is `False`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `energy_keep_on` to `a * time_diff`. Given that `time_diff` is initially `arr[3] - arr[1]`, the new value of `energy_keep_on` becomes `a * (arr[3] - arr[1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
