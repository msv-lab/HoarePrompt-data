Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers entered by the user, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `possible`. No other variables are affected, and the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
