Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `b`, and `f` is decreased by `b`.**

Explanation: The line `energy_turn_off_on = b` updates the value of `energy_turn_off_on` to `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
