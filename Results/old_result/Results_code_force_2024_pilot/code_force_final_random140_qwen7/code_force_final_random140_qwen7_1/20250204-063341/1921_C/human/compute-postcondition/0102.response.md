Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, and `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `time_diff` to `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `time_diff` is now updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
