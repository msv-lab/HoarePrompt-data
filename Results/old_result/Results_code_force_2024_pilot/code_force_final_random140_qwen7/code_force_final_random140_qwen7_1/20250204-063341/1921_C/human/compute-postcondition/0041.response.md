Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `i` is `n`, `time_diff` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_keep_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_turn_off_on` is undefined because the loop has ended, `energy_cost` is undefined because the loop has ended, `f` is `f - sum(min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b) for i in range(1, n + 1))`, `n` is an integer obtained from input, `f` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input and prepended with 0.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `f` is updated based on the given formula, but the other variables (`time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`) remain undefined because they were not assigned any values in the provided code.
