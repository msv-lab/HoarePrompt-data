Output State: **`a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a `frozenset` named `a` by converting the input values (which were initially assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k`) into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. After executing this line, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and a new variable `a` is created with a `frozenset` containing the integers from the input.
