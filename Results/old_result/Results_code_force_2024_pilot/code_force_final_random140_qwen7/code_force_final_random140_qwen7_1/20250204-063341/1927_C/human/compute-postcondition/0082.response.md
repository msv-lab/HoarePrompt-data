Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input, `b` is updated to a frozenset of integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k`, `t` is the integer input received.**

Explanation: The line `aOnes = 0` sets the variable `aOnes` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
