Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`.**
