Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `bOnes = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `bOnes`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `aOnes`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `leftOnes` as they were in the initial state, while updating `bOnes` to 0.
