Output State: **`aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 2, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes**.

The value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
