Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 1 more than its original value or within the range of 0 to the size of set `a`, inclusive, depending on whether `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. `bOnes` is either incremented by 1 or remains between 0 and the size of set `b`, inclusive. `i`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values. `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, and `newk` is `k // 2`.**
