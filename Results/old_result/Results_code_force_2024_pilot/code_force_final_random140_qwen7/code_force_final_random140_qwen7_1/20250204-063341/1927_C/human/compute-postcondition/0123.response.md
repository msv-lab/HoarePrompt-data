Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 4, `leftOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 5 if `i` is found in `a`. Otherwise, `i` remains 4 and no other variables change.**
