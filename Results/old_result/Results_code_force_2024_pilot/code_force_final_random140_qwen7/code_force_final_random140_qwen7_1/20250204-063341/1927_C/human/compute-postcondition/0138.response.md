Output State: **`aOnes` is `aOnes` + 1, `bOnes` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `newk` is unchanged, `i` is 1, and `leftOnes` must be greater than 1.**

The code `aOnes += 1` increments the value of `aOnes` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
