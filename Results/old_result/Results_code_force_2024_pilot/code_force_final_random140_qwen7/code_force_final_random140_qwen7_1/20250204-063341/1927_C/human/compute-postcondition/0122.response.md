Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 4, `leftOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 4. If `i` is found in `b`, the condition does not change any variables. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
