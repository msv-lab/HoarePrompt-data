Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 (increased by 1 if `i` is in `b`), `i` is 2, `t` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a frozenset of integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from the integers entered by the user, `leftOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, and either `i` is in both `a` and `b` or in neither of them, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
