To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while i <= k:
```
This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

### Given States
- `aOnes` is either 0 or 1
- `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2
- `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input
- `n` is the first integer input
- `m` is the second integer input
- `k` is at least 1
- `leftOnes` is 0 or 1
- `newk` is `k // 2`
- `i` is 4

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.
2. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
3. **Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Given that `i` is 4, the loop will continue if `k` is greater than or equal to 4. Since `k` is at least 1 and `k` is an integer, the minimum value `k` can take is 1. However, for the loop to continue, `k` must be at least 4.

### Adjusting the States
- **`k`**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be at least 4.
- **Other Variables**: The values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `leftOnes`, and `newk` do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Answer
State: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 4, `leftOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 4**
