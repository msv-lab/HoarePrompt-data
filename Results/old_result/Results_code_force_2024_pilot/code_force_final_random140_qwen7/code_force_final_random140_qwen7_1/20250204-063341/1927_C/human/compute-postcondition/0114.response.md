Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 1, `leftOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` must be 3. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` remains 1. If `i` is not in `a` but is in `b`, then `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `leftOnes`, `newk`, and `i` retain their original values. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
