Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of these variables is now set to the values provided by the user's input.
