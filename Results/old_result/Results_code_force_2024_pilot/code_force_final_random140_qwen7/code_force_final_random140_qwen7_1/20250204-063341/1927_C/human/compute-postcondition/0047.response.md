Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 (possibly incremented by 1), `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 3, and if `i` is in both sets `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, `leftOnes` remains 0.**
