Output State: All test cases have been processed, meaning `t` is equal to the total number of test cases initially provided. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values from each test case. `a` and `b` are frozensets containing the integers from the inputs for each respective test case. `leftOnes` is the count of numbers that are present in both `a` and `b`. `newk` is `k // 2`. `aOnes` and `bOnes` are the counts of numbers that are present in `a` and `b` respectively, up to the value of `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` and `bOnes` both equal `newk`, the output for that test case is 'yes'; otherwise, it is 'no'. The variable `i` is not relevant to the final state as it is reset to `k` and `leftOnes` at the end of each iteration.
