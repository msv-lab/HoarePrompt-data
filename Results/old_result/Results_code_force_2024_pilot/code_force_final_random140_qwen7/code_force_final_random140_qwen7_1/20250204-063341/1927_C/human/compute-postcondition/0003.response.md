Output State: **`a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a frozenset from these integers. This operation does not affect the existing values of `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, `a` remains a frozenset containing integers from the initial input, and `b` becomes a frozenset of integers from the new input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were assigned from the initial input.
