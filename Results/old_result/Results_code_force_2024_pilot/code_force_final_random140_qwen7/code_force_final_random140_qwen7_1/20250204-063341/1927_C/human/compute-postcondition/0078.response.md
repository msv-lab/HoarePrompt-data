Output State: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `leftOnes` is equal to `k`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k`, and `t` is the integer input received.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. It does not affect the values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `a`, `b`, `leftOnes`, `newk`, `i`, and `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values or conditions.
