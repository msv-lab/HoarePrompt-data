Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 1, `leftOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 1 or 2. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0, and `leftOnes` becomes 1. If `i` is in either `a` or `b` but not both, `aOnes` or `bOnes` becomes 1, and `leftOnes` remains 0.**
