Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` becomes 2 and `bOnes` becomes 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains 1 and `bOnes` becomes 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets containing integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 0.**
