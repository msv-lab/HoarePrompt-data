Postcondition: `aOnes` is either 1 more than its original value or within the range of 0 to the size of set `a`, inclusive, `bOnes` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values, and `leftOnes` must be greater than `i + 2`.
