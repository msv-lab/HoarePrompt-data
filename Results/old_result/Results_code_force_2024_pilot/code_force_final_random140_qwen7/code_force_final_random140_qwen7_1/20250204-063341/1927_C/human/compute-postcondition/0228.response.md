Postcondition: **`aOnes` will be equal to `leftOnes`, which is between 0 and the number of elements in `a` and `b` combined, inclusive; `bOnes` will also be equal to `leftOnes`, which means `aOnes` and `bOnes` will both be `leftOnes`; `i` will be equal to `leftOnes`; `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values; `newk` is `k // 2`. The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is false.**
