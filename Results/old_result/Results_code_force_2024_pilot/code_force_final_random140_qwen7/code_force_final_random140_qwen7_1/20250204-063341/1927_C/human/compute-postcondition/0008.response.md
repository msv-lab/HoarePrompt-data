Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `i = 1` assigns the integer value 1 to the variable `i`. This assignment does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `leftOnes`, and `newk` remain unchanged from their initial states.
