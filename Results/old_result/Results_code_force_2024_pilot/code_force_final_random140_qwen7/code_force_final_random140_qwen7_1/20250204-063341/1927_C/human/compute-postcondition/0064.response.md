Output State: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1; `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input; `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers; `leftOnes` must be greater than 1; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 2.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
