Output State: **`a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `leftOnes` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
