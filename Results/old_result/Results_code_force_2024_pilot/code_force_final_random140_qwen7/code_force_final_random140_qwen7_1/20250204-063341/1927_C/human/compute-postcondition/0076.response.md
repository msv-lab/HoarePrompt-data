Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `leftOnes` is equal to `k`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k`, and either both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk` or at least one of them is not equal to `newk`.**
