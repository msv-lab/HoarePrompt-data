Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is 3, `t` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers entered by the user, `b` is a frozenset created from the integers entered by the user, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`**.

This means that the value of `k` is divided by 2 and stored in `newk`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
