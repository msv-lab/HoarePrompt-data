Output State: **`aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input, `b` is updated to a frozenset of integers from the new input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` must be at least 1, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is in `a`.**
