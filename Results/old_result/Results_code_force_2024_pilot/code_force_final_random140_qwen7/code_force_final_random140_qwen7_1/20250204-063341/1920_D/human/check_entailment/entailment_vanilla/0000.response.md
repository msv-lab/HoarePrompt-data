Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of operations) and `q` (number of queries).
   - It initializes an array `a` with a single element `[0]` and a dictionary `b`.

2. **Processing Operations:**
   - It iterates through `n` operations.
   - For each operation, it reads the operation type (`d`) and value (`e`).
   - If the last element of `a` exceeds \(10^{19}\), it skips the operation.
   - If the operation type is 1, it increments the last element of `a` and updates the dictionary `b` with the new length and the corresponding value.
   - If the operation type is 2, it appends `e` copies of the current array `a` to itself.

3. **Reversing Array and Query Processing:**
   - The array `a` is reversed.
   - It reads `q` queries and processes each query using a function `func_1`.

4. **Query Processing Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a query index `x`.
   - It converts `x` to an integer.
   - If `x` is found in the dictionary `b`, it returns the corresponding value.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the array `a` to find the position of `x` and returns the corresponding value from the dictionary `b`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Handling Large Values:**
   - The program checks if `a[-1] > 10^19` and skips operations if true. However, this check is not sufficient because the problem guarantees that the array size will never exceed \(10^{18}\). Therefore, the check should be removed or handled more robustly.

2. **Array Reversal and Query Handling:**
   - The array `a` is reversed, but the problem specifies that the array should be processed in the original order. Reversing the array can lead to incorrect results for queries.

3. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle queries, but it incorrectly handles the modulo operation and the logic for finding the correct position in the array. The logic should directly map the query index to the correct position in the array without reversing it.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain the array in its original order and use a more efficient way to handle queries. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = []
    b = {}
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    
    for i in range(n):
        (d, e) = map(int, input().split())
        if d == 1:
            a.append(e)
            b[len(a)] = e
        elif d == 2:
            a.extend([a[-1]] * (e - 1))
            b[len(a)] = a[-1]
    
    res = []
    for k in map(int, input().split()):
        pos = k
        for i in range(len(a) - 1, 0, -1):
            if pos <= i:
                res.append(b[i])
                break
            pos -= i
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Conclusion

The original program has several issues, including incorrect handling of large values, array reversal, and query processing logic. The corrected approach maintains the array in its original order and uses a more efficient method to process queries.

**Correctness: **False**
