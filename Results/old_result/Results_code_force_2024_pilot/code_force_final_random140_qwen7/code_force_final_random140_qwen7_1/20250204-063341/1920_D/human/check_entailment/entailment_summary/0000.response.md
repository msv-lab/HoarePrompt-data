### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves constructing an array `a` through a series of operations and answering queries about specific elements in the final array. The operations include appending a single element or appending multiple copies of the current array.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes an array `a` with a dummy element `[0]`.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `b` to store the lengths of the array segments.
   - It processes each operation: if the operation type is 1, it appends the specified element to the last segment; if the operation type is 2, it appends the specified number of copies of the current array.
   - After processing all operations, it reverses the array `a` and prints the results of the queries.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `x` and returns an element from the dictionary `b` at the computed index.
   - If `x` is not found in `b`, it iterates over the array `a` and computes a new index using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`.
   - This computation effectively maps the query index to the correct position in the final array.

4. **Execution Summary**:
   - The summary correctly describes how the function `func_1` works, including the handling of indices and the mapping logic.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the operations and builds the array `a`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly maps the query indices to the correct positions in the final array.
   - The reversal of the array `a` and the subsequent query processing ensure that the correct elements are returned for each query.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
