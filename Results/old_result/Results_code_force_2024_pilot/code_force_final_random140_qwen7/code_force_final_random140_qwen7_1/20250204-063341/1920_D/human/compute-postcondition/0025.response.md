Output State: **`i` is `x + 1` and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i` or `x`, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
