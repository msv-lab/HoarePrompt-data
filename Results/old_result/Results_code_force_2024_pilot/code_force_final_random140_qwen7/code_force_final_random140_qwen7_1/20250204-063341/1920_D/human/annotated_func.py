#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The first integer indicates the type of operation (1 or 2), and the second integer indicates the value or the number of copies involved in the operation. Additionally, the size of the array after performing all operations is at most \(10^{18}\), and the queries are integers \(k_i\) such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c)\), where \(c\) is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns an element from list `b` at index `x`, where `x` is an integer and exists within the range of indices of list `b`
    #State: `x` is an integer, and `x` is not in `b`
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: Output State: The function returns the element at index `x` in list `b`, where `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the last element in list `a`, if `x` is found in list `b`. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the function will check the final value of `x` against the list `b`. If `x` is found in `b`, it will return the element at that index. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function will return `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single integer `x` and returns an element from list `b` at index `x`. If `x` is not found in `b`, it returns `None`. The index `x` is initially set to the value of `x` passed as a parameter. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function iterates over the list `a` and updates `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the current element in `a`. After the loop, if `x` is still not found in `b`, the function returns `None`.
