Output State: The function returns the element at index `x` in list `b`, where `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the last element in list `a`, if `x` is found in list `b`. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the function will check the final value of `x` against the list `b`. If `x` is found in `b`, it will return the element at that index. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function will return `None`.
