Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers: the first integer represents the type of operation (1 or 2), and the second integer represents the value or the number of copies involved in the operation. The function returns an element from list `b` at index `x`, where `x` is an integer and exists within the range of indices of list `b`. If `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the first element in the list `a`, the function returns an element from collection `b` at the adjusted index. If `x` is not present in list `b`, the function returns the element at the adjusted index. If `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` and `i` is the third element in list `a`, the function returns the element at the adjusted index.**
