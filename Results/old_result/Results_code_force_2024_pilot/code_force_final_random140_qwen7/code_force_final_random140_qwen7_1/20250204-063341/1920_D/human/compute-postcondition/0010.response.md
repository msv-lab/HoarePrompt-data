Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is an integer equal to `(x - 1) % i + 1`.
   - `i` is the first element in the list `a`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `x` is not present in the list `b`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - The variable `i` takes the value of the current element in the list `a` during each iteration.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the start of the loop, `i` is set to the first element of the list `a`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be set to the second element of the list `a`.
   - We need to update the state to reflect this change.

4. **State Update**:
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is defined based on the initial value of `i` and does not depend on the loop iteration.
   - `i` changes to the second element of the list `a`.
   - `a` remains the same list, but its first element is now the second element for the next iteration.
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Final State**:
   - `x` is still an integer equal to `(x - 1) % i + 1` (where `i` is the first element of the original list `a`).
   - `i` is now the second element of the list `a`.
   - `a` is the same list, but its first element is now the second element.
   - `x` is not present in the list `b`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`x` is an integer equal to `(x - 1) % i + 1`, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `a` is a non-empty list, and `x` is not present in the list `b`**.
