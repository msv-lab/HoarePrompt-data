Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to handle the operations and queries as described. Specifically, the program does not properly append the array or its copies as required. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Appending Operations**: The program attempts to append elements and their copies but does not correctly update the array `a` as specified. For instance, when an operation of type 2 is performed, the array should be appended `x` times, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

2. **Query Handling**: The program uses a dictionary `b` to store values, but it does not correctly map the positions of elements in the array after all operations are performed. This leads to incorrect results when querying the k-th element.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```

The expected behavior is:
- After the first operation, `a = [1]`.
- After the second operation, `a = [1, 2]`.
- After the third operation, `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`.
- After the fourth operation, `a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
- After the fifth operation, `a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

However, the provided program does not correctly simulate these operations. For example, after the fifth operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`, but the program does not achieve this state.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly handle the operations and produce the expected results for the queries, making it incorrect.
