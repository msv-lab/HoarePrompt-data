Output State: **The program returns 1 and -1**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `a` is a non-negative integer divisible by `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The expression `a // b` performs integer division, which means it returns the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`. Since `a` is divisible by `b`, the quotient is a non-negative integer. Subtracting 1 from this quotient gives another integer. Negating this result yields a negative integer. Therefore, the program returns `1` and `-1`, where `-1` is the negation of the integer obtained by subtracting 1 from the quotient of `a // b`.
