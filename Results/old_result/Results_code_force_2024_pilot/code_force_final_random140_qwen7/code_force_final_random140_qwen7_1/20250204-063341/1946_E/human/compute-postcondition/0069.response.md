Postcondition: **`cur` is `R.count(R[0]) + 1`, `i` is `N`, `nums_left` is `0`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.**

Explanation: After the if condition `M2 > 1` is met, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `cur` is set to `R.count(R[0]) + 1`.
- The variable `i` is incremented to `N`.
- The variable `nums_left` is reduced to `0`.
- The variable `ans` remains the final computed value after the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
