Output State: **`ans` is `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`, `cur` is 2, `i` is equal to `R[1] + 1`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulo `MOD`. Since `nums_left` is defined as `N - R[0] - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, and `nums_left`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
