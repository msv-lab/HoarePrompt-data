Output State: **The program returns the tuple (d, c - a // b * d), where `d` is the result of `func_1(b, a % b)`, `c` is `a % b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`.**

Explanation: Given the initial state where `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` is calculated as `a % b`, and `d` is the result of calling `func_1(b, a % b)`. The return statement calculates and returns a tuple containing `d` and `c - a // b * d`. Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a // b` gives the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`, and `c - a // b * d` is computed using these values.
