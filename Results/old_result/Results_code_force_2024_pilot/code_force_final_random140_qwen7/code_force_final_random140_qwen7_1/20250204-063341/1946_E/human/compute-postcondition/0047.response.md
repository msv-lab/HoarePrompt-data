Output State: **`cur` is 2, `i` is equal to `R[cur-1]`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`i`, `nums_left`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
