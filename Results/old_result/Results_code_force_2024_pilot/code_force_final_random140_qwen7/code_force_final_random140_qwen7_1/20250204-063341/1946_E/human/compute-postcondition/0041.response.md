Output State: **`cur` is `M1 - (N + 1)`, `i` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and updating it based on the conditions inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nums_left` to `N - R[0] - 1`. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
