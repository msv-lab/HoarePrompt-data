Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is `M1 - 2`, N is an integer representing the length of the permutation, M1 and M2 are integers where M1 is greater than 1 and M2 can be any value, L is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, R is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in L is equal to the first index in R, with L[0] being equal to 1 and R[-1] being equal to N, the second last index in L is not equal to the second index in R, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, i is `L[-1] - 1`, ans is the return value of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is either `M1 - 3` or `M1 - 2`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0]` being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, `i` is either `L[-1] - 4` or not equal to `L[cur]`, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and `L[-1]` must be at least 2. If `i == L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 3`. If `i != L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 2` and `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `cur` is either `M1 - 4` or `M1 - 3`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0] being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is now `i - 1`, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` updated according to the condition `i == L[cur] - 1` or `i != L[cur] - 1`. If `i == L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 4`. If `i != L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 3` and `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` or `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` respectively.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `cur` is either `M1 - 5` or `M1 - 4`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0] being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`, `i` is now `i - 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD` if `i != L[cur] - 1` and `cur` is `M1 - 4`, or `ans` remains unchanged if `i == L[cur] - 1` and `cur` is `M1 - 5`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
