Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is either `M1 - 4` or `M1 - 3`.
   - `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation.
   - `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value.
   - `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order.
   - `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers.
   - The last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`.
   - `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[-1]` is equal to `N`.
   - The second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`.
   - `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`.
   - `i` is now `i - 1`.
   - `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` updated according to the condition `i == L[cur] - 1` or `i != L[cur] - 1`. If `i == L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 4`. If `i != L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 3` and `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` or `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` respectively.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop condition `i > 1` depends on the value of `i`.
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

4. **Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1.
   - Since `i` is currently `i - 1` (from the previous iteration), we need to ensure that `i - 1 > 1` or equivalently `i > 2`.

5. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

**Answer**:
State: **`cur` is either `M1 - 4` or `M1 - 3`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0] being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` must be greater than 2, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` updated according to the condition `i == L[cur] - 1` or `i != L[cur] - 1`. If `i == L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 4`. If `i != L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 3` and `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` or `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` respectively.**
