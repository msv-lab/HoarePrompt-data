Output State: `cur` is the last index where `i` equals `R[cur]` plus one, `i` is equal to `N`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - (N - 1)`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `cur` will be the index right after the last match of `i` with `R[cur]`.
- `i` will be equal to `N`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- `nums_left` will be `N - R[0] - (N - 1)`, which simplifies to `1 - R[0]`. Since `nums_left` cannot be negative, it will effectively be `max(1 - R[0], 0)`.
- `ans` will be the result of the multiplication operations performed within the loop, modulo `MOD`.
