Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.

2. **Current State Variables**:
   - `cur` is either `M1 - 3` or `M1 - 2`.
   - `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation.
   - `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value.
   - `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order.
   - `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers.
   - The last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`.
   - `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[-1]` is equal to `N`.
   - The second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`.
   - `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`.
   - `i` is either `L[-1] - 4` or not equal to `L[cur]`.
   - `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
   - `L[-1]` must be at least 2.
   - If `i == L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 3`.
   - If `i != L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 2` and `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD.

3. **Determine Which States Need Adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i`. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`.

4. **Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `L[-1] - 4` or not equal to `L[cur]`.
   - Since `L[-1]` is at least 2, `L[-1] - 4` would be at most `-2`, which is not valid as `i` must be a positive integer.
   - Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to be greater than 1.

5. **Final State**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be greater than 1.

**Answer**:
State: **`cur` is either `M1 - 3` or `M1 - 2`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0]` being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, `i` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and `L[-1]` must be at least 2. If `i == L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 3`. If `i != L[cur] - 1`, then `cur` is `M1 - 2` and `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD.**
