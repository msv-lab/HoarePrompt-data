The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where both are non-negative integers and `b` is non-zero. It returns one of four possible tuples: (1, 0), (the second return value of `func_1(b, a)` and the result of `func_1(b, a)`), (1, -1), or (d, c - a // b * d), where `d` is the result of `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c` is `a % b` when `a` is not divisible by `b`.
