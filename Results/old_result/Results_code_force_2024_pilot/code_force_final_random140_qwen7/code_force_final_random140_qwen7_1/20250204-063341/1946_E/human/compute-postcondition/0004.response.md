Output State: **`a` is less than `b`, `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a)` with `b` as the first argument and `a` as the second argument, and `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`.**

This means that the function `func_1(b, a)` has been called with `b` and `a` as arguments, and it has returned two values which are assigned to `c` and `d` respectively. The initial conditions that `a` is a non-negative integer less than `b` (where `b` is also a non-negative integer and non-zero) remain unchanged.
