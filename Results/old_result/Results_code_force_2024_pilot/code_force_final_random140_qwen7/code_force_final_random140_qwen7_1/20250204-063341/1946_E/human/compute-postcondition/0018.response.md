Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state step by step:

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `i > 1`.
- The initial state is:
  - `cur` is `M1 - 2`
  - `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation
  - `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value
  - `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order
  - `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers
  - The last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`
  - `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[-1]` is equal to `N`
  - The second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`
  - `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`
  - `i` is `L[-1] - 1`
  - `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `i > 1`.

### Initial Values:
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`

### Required Adjustment:
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is greater than 1.

### Analysis:
- Since `i` is defined as `L[-1] - 1`, we need to check the value of `L[-1]`.
- If `L[-1]` is 2 or more, then `i` will be 1 or more, satisfying the condition `i > 1`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `L[-1]`. Specifically, `L[-1]` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cur` is `M1 - 2`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0]` being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and `L[-1] must be at least 2`**
