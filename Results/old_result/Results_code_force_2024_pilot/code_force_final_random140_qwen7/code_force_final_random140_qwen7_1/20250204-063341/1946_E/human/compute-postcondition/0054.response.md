Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is 2
   - `i` is equal to `R[1]`
   - `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`
   - `i` is increased by 1

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and the constant `N`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `N` for the loop to execute again.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - `i` was equal to `R[1]` and was then incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` is now `R[1] + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is now `R[1] + 1`, we need to ensure that `R[1] + 1` is less than `N`.
   - This means `R[1]` must be less than `N - 1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `R[1]` must be less than `N - 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is 2, `i` is equal to `R[1] + 1`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, and `R[1]` must be less than `N - 1`**
