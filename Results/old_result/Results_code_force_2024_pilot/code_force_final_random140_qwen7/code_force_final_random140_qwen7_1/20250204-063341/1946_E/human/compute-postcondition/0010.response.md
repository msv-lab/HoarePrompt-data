Output State: **`a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` is `a % b`, `d` is the result of `func_1(b, a % b)`**.

Explanation: The code `c, d = func_1(b, a % b)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a % b`. Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a % b` will give a non-zero remainder. The function `func_1` returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`. The initial conditions of `a` being a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `b` and not divisible by `b` remain unchanged.
