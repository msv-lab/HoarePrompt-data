### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the permutation problem. However, the original assessment overlooks the fact that the annotated code actually implements a correct approach to solving the problem, despite the irrelevant functions being present.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the annotated code is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The code initializes a list `facts` to store factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for computing combinations later.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

3. **Checking Fixed Points**:
   - It checks if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If not, it prints 0 immediately since no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - For each suffix maximum, it calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements using combinations. Specifically, it computes the number of ways to choose positions for the elements between the current suffix maximum and the next one.
   - Similarly, it does the same for the prefix maximums in reverse order.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The combination calculations use the `func_2` function, which correctly computes the modular inverse and performs the necessary multiplications.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   ```python
   facts = [1]
   ch = 1
   for i in range(1, 200002):
       ch *= i
       ch %= 1000000007
       facts.append(ch)
   ```
   - This precomputes factorials up to \(200001\) and stores them in `facts`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, m1, m2) = map(int, input().split())
       p = list(map(int, input().split()))
       s = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   - Reads the input for each test case.

3. **Fixed Point Check**:
   ```python
   if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] != 1 or s[-1] != n:
       print(0)
   ```
   - Checks if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If not, no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculations**:
   ```python
   ans = 1
   kol = n
   for x in s:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = n - x
   kol = s[0] - 1
   p2 = []
   for i in range(m1 - 2, -1, -1):
       p2.append(p[i])
   for x in p2:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = x - 1
   print(ans)
   ```
   - Computes the number of valid permutations using combinations and modular arithmetic.

### Conclusion

While the irrelevant functions `func_1` and `func_2` are present, the annotated code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the functions were not relevant, but they are indeed used correctly within the context of the problem.

**Final: True**
