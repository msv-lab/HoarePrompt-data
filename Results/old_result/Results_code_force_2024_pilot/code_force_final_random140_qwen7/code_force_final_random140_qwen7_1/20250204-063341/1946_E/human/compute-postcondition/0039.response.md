Output State: `cur` is `M1 - (N + 1)`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0]` being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - (N + 1)`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` updated according to the conditions within the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cur` will be `M1 - (N + 1)`, `i` will be 0, and `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - (N + 1)`. The variable `ans` will hold the final computed value after applying the loop's operations, starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and updating it based on the conditions inside the loop.
