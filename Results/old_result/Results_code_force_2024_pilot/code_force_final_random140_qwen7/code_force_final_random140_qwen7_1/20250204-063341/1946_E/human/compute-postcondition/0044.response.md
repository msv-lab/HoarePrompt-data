Output State: **`cur` is 1, `i` is 2, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is assigned the value `R[0] + 1`. Given the initial state, `R[0]` is not specified, but it does not affect the calculation since the initial value of `i` is updated to `R[0] + 1`. The other variables (`cur`, `nums_left`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
