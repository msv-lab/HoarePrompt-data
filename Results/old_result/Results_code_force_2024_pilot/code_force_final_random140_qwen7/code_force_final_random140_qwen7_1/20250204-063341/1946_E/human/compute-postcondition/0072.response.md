Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: the length of a permutation (N), the number of prefix maximums (M1), the number of suffix maximums (M2), and two lists (L and R) representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. It returns 0 in three specific cases and the final computed value after applying certain operations in the fourth case. In the fourth case, it starts with a value obtained from another function (`func_1`) and updates this value through loops based on the indices in lists L and R, finally returning the updated value modulo some constant (MOD).**
