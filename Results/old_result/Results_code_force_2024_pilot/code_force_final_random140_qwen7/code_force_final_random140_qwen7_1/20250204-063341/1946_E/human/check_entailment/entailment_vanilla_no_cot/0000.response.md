Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not appear to be related to solving the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, they seem to be related to some form of modular arithmetic, possibly involving the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is not directly applicable to the problem at hand.

To solve the problem, you would need to implement logic that takes into account the constraints and properties of prefix and suffix maximums to count the valid permutations. The given functions do not provide this functionality.
