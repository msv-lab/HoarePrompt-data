Output State: `cur` is `R.count(R[0]) + 1`, `i` is `N`, `nums_left` is `0`, and `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `N` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `N`. The variable `nums_left` starts as `N - R[0] - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0. Therefore, `nums_left` will be 0 after all iterations. The variable `cur` will be incremented each time `i` equals `R[cur]`, and it will stop incrementing once `i` reaches `N`. If `R[cur]` does not appear in `R` multiple times, `cur` will simply be `len(R)`. However, since we start with `cur` as 1 and increment it each time `i` matches `R[cur]`, and given the pattern described, `cur` will be `R.count(R[0]) + 1` after all iterations. Finally, `ans` will be the product of the remaining terms after each iteration, modulo `MOD`.
