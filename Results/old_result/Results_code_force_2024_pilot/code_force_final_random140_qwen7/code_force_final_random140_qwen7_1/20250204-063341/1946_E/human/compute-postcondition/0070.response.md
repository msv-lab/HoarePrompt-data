Output State: **The program returns the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)**

This means that the program returns the value stored in the variable `ans`, which is the result of performing certain operations starting from the value returned by the function `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. The exact value of `ans` depends on the operations performed in the loop and the initial value provided by `func_1`.
