Output State: `cur` is either `M1 - (N + 1)` or `M1 - N`, `N` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are integers where `M1` is greater than 1 and `M2` can be any value, `L` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, `R` is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order after converting the input to integers, the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`, with `L[0]` being equal to 1 and `R[-1]` being equal to `N`, the second last index in `L` is not equal to the second index in `R`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - (N + 1)`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` updated according to the conditions within the loop. If `i == L[cur] - 1` at any iteration, `cur` decreases by 1; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`. After all iterations, `i` will reach 0, and `cur` will be either `M1 - (N + 1)` if it was decremented in every iteration or `M1 - N` if it was not decremented in the last iteration.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed its iterations, assuming the loop runs until `i` reaches 0.
