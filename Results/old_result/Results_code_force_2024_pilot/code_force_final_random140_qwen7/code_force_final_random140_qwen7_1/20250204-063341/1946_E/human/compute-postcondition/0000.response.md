Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, `c` and `d` are the return values from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.

Explanation: The code `c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `1000000007`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`. The initial state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged, but now `c` and `d` have been introduced with the return values from `func_1`.
