Output State: **`cur` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`cur`, `ans`, `nums_left`) retain their previous values from the initial state. The operations on `ans` and `nums_left` remain unchanged.
