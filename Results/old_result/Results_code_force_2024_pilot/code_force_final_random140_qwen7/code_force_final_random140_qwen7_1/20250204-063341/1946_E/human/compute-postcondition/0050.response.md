Output State: **`cur` is 1, `i` is 2, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, and `nums_left`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `ans` is the final computed value after the multiplication operation.
