Postcondition: **`cur` is 2, `i` is equal to `R[cur-1]`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `ans` is the final computed value. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `ans` remains the same as the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` is the final computed value after applying the loop's operations starting from the initial value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**
