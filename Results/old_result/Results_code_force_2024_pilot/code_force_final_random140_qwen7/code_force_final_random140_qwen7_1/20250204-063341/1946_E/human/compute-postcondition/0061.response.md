Output State: **`cur` is 4, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, and `i + 1 < N`**.

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` was 3, so now `cur` is 4. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `nums_left`, and the condition `i + 1 < N`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
