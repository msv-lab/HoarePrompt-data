Output State: **`num_iterations` is the user input minus 1, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[i]` if `a[-1]` is less than `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise it is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `i + 2`, `a` is updated by appending `lit[i]` to it.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
