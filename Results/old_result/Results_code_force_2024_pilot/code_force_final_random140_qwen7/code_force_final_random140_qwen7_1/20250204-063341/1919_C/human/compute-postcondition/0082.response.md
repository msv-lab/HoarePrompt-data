Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `num_iterations` remains the user input minus 1, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is still 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `n`.**

This means that after the loop completes, the following conditions hold true:
- `num_iterations` retains the value of the user input minus 1.
- `b` is populated with elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a`.
- `s` remains 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` contains the initial element of `lit` and any additional elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element in `a`.
- `lit` remains unchanged.
- `cp` is still 0.
- `i` is set to `n`.
