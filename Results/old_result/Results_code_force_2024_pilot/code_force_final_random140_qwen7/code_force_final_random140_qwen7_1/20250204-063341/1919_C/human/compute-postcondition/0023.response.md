Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the elements of `lit` in non-decreasing order, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that all elements in `lit` have been processed. The list `a` will be filled with the smallest sequence of elements from `lit` such that each subsequent element in `a` is greater than or equal to the previous one. The list `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that were found to be strictly greater than the last element added to `a` during the loop's iterations.
