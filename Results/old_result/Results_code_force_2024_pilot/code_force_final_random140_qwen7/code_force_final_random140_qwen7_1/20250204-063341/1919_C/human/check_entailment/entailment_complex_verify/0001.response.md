### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and the Given Solution:**
   - The problem requires us to split the array into two subsequences such that the total penalty (number of increasing pairs in each subsequence) is minimized.
   - The given solution attempts to achieve this by maintaining a list `a` with the smallest element from the input list followed by elements from the input list that are greater than the last element added to `a`. The remaining elements are placed in list `b`.

2. **Analysis of the Given Solution:**
   - The solution iterates through the elements of `lit` and decides whether to add each element to `a` or `b` based on whether it is greater than the last element in `a`.
   - This approach ensures that `a` is a non-decreasing sequence up to the last element added to it.
   - The solution then calculates the penalties for both `a` and `b` by counting the number of increasing pairs of consecutive elements.

3. **Evaluation Using the Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code explains that the final state of the loop will have `i` equal to the length of `b`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of `b`.
   - The list `b` consists of all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`.
   - The variable `s` holds the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one.
   - The solution does not consider other possible splits or rearrangements of elements between `a` and `b` to minimize the total penalty.

4. **Verification Against Examples:**
   - The provided examples show that the current approach might not yield the optimal solution. For instance, in the second test case, the optimal split would be `s=[8,3,1]` and `t=[2,1,7,4,3]`, resulting in a penalty of 1, which matches the expected output.
   - The current implementation only tries to maintain the order of elements in `a` and `b` without considering other possible splits, which can lead to suboptimal solutions.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the current approach does not guarantee an optimal split of the array to minimize the total penalty.
   - The solution provided does not consider all possible ways to split the array and rearrange elements to achieve the minimum penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not guarantee an optimal split of the array to minimize the total penalty.
