Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, `b` is a list with one additional element which is equal to `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 1, `b` now contains one more element, which is the element at index 1 of `lit`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
