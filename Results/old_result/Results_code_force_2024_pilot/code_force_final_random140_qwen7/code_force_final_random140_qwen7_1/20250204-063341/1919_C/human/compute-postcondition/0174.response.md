Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it identifies two lists: `a` and `b`. List `a` contains the smallest element from the input list followed by elements from the input list that are greater than the last element added to `a`. List `b` contains the remaining elements from the input list that are not in `a`. The function then counts the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the preceding element and prints this count for each test case.**
