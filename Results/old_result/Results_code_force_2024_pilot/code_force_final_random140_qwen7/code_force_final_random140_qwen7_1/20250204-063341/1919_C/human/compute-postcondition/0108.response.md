Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `b` contains at least 2 elements

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(b)`. Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `len(b)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `i = 3`.
   - `b` must still contain at least 2 elements (this condition does not change).

5. **Postcondition consideration**: The postcondition involves the value of `s`, but since the loop itself does not modify `s` directly, we don't need to adjust `s` based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `b` contains at least 2 elements**
