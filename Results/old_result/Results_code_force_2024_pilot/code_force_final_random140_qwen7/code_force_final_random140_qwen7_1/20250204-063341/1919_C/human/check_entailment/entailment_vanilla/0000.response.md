Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by splitting the array `lit` into two subsequences `a` and `b`. It iterates through the elements of `lit`, starting from the second element, and decides whether to add each element to `a` or `b` based on whether it is greater than the last element in `a`.
2. After splitting the array, the program calculates the penalties for both `a` and `b` by counting the number of increasing pairs of consecutive elements.
3. However, the logic for splitting the array might not always yield the optimal solution. Specifically, the current approach only considers the relative order of elements within `a` and `b` but does not consider the possibility of rearranging elements between `a` and `b` to minimize the total penalty.
4. The example in the problem statement shows that there can be better splits. For instance, in the second test case, the optimal split would be `s=[8,3,1]` and `t=[2,1,7,4,3]`, resulting in a penalty of 1, which matches the expected output.
5. The current implementation does not guarantee the optimal solution because it only tries to maintain the order of elements in `a` and `b` without considering other possible splits.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not guarantee an optimal split of the array to minimize the total penalty.
