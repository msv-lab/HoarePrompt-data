Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `b`, `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`, and `s` will be the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its predecessor.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the list `b` starting from the second element (index 1) and checks if the current element is greater than the previous one. Each time it finds such an element, it increments `s`. Since the loop continues until `i` is equal to the length of `b`, it means that all elements in `b` have been checked. Therefore, `i` will be equal to the length of `b`. The value of `s` will be the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding elements. Variables `a` and `lit` are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial or previously determined states.
