Output State: **`n` must be between 1 and len(a) inclusive, `i` is an index such that 1 <= i <= len(a), and the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]`; `s` is incremented by 1.**

The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. All other conditions and constraints on the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be between 1 and `len(a)` inclusive, `i` is still an index such that 1 <= i <= len(a), and the value of `a[i]` is still greater than the value of `a[i - 1]`. The only new information is that `s` has been incremented by 1.
