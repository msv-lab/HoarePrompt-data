Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations, which is effectively the loop counter.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `int(input())` will return a value between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - The loop will execute as many times as this value.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range.
   - The initial state should reflect that the input value (which determines the number of iterations) is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself, ensuring it falls within the required range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`int(input())` must be a valid integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
