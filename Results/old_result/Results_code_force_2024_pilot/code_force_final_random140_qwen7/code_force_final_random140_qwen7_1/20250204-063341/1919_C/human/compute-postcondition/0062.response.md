Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The initial value of `i` is set to 1 by the loop itself, so we don't need to explicitly set `i` to 1.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

4. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - `num_iterations`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `lit`, and `cp` are not directly involved in the loop and do not affect whether the loop can execute. They can remain as they are.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`num_iterations` is the user input - 1, `b` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0**
