Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_iterations` is the user input - 1, `b` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_iterations` is the user input minus 1, `b` is either an empty list or a list containing the element `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise it is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and the last element of `a` is either less than or greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num_iterations` is the user input minus 1, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[i]` if `a[-1]` is less than `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise it is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num_iterations` is the user input minus 1, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[i]` if `a[-1]` is less than `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise it is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `a[-1]` is less than `lit[i]`, `b` now includes `lit[i]`; otherwise, `a` is updated by appending `lit[i]` to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
