Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. The approach in the given code does not ensure that the penalty is minimized by optimally splitting the array into two subsequences. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The current implementation splits the array into two parts (`a` and `b`) based on whether the current element is greater than the last element of `a`. This does not guarantee the minimum penalty.
   
2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is calculated by counting the number of increasing pairs within each subsequence. However, this does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the overall penalty.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a more sophisticated approach. One effective method is to sort the array and then split it at a point that minimizes the penalty. Specifically, we can split the array just after the first occurrence of the smallest element that is greater than the previous element when traversing from left to right.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        lit.sort()
        
        # Find the optimal split point
        split_point = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if lit[i] > lit[i-1]:
                split_point = i
                break
        
        # Calculate penalties for both subsequences
        s_penalty = sum(1 for i in range(1, split_point) if lit[i] > lit[i-1])
        t_penalty = sum(1 for i in range(split_point+1, n) if lit[i] > lit[i-1])
        
        print(s_penalty + t_penalty)

func()
```

This solution sorts the array and finds the optimal split point to minimize the penalty. It then calculates the penalties for both subsequences and sums them up to get the minimum possible penalty.
