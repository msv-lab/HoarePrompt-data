Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - Either `a` contains the element `lit[2]` and `b` contains the element `lit[2]` if `a[-1] < lit[2]`, or `a` contains the element `lit[2]` and `b` also contains the element `lit[2]` if the condition `a[-1] < lit[2]` is false.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means `i` should be incremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body and must still be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.

5. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The condition `a[-1] < lit[2]` does not change based on the loop incrementing `i`. Therefore, the conditions regarding `a` and `b` remain the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and either `a` contains the element `lit[2]` and `b` contains the element `lit[2]` if `a[-1] < lit[2]`, or `a` contains the element `lit[2]` and `b` also contains the element `lit[2]` if the condition `a[-1] < lit[2]` is false**.
