Output State: **`num_iterations` is the user input - 1, `b` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cp` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.
