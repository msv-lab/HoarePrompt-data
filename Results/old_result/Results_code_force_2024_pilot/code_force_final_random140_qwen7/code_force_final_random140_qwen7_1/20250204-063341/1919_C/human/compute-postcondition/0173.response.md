Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. For each test case, the function checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n are met for all i from 1 to n. It also ensures that the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. If all conditions are satisfied, it processes the data; otherwise, it returns an appropriate message indicating the failure.**
