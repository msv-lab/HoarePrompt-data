Output State: **`num_iterations` is the user input minus 1, `b` is either an empty list or a list containing the element `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise it is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `i + 1`; `a` has had `lit[i]` appended to it.**

This means that the list `a` has been updated by appending `lit[i]` to its current contents. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
