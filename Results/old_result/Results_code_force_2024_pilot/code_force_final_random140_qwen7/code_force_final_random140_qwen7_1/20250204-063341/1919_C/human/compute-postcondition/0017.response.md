Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers. If the last element of `a` is less than `lit[2]`, then `b` is a list with one additional element containing the integer at index 2 of list `a`. Otherwise, `a` is a list with the element from `lit[2]` appended to it, and `b` is a list with one additional element.
