Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by splitting the input array into two subsequences (`a` and `b`) based on a specific condition and then calculating the penalty for each subsequence. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Splitting Logic**: The program tries to construct `a` and `b` such that `a` contains the smallest element followed by elements greater than the last element added to `a`, and `b` contains the rest. This approach does not guarantee the optimal split that minimizes the total penalty.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is calculated by counting the number of increasing pairs in both `a` and `b`. This is a correct way to calculate the penalty for a given split but does not ensure the optimal split.

3. **Optimal Split**: The optimal split would involve sorting the array and then splitting it at a point that minimizes the total number of increasing pairs across the two resulting subsequences. The current logic does not achieve this.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
