Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list with the element from `lit[2]` appended to it; `b` is a list with one additional element.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, `a` will append `lit[2]` to itself. The other variables (`n` and `b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
