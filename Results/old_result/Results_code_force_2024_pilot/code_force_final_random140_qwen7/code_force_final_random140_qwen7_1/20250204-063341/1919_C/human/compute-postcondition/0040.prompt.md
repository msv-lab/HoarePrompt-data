Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the elements of `lit` in non-decreasing order, `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`, and `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a list with at least one element, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, the values of `i`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `s` is 1. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`, then the postcondition remains the same. If `a[2]` is not greater than `a[1]`, then the postcondition also remains the same since there is no else part that changes the values of the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is a list with at least one element, `s` is 2, and if the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `i-1`, then the postcondition remains as specified in the if part; otherwise, the postcondition does not change from the else part since there is no specific else part provided other than the absence of a change mentioned.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
