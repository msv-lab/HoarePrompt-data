Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `num_iterations` is the user input minus 1, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly some elements from `lit` depending on the comparison with the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `b` will contain all the elements from the original list `lit` that are greater than the last element added to list `a`. The list `a` will start with the first element of `lit` and may include additional elements from `lit` based on the comparison with the last element of `a`. The variable `num_iterations` remains as the user input minus one, `s` remains 0, `n` remains greater than 1, `lit` remains unchanged, `cp` remains 0, and `i` will be equal to `n` since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`.
