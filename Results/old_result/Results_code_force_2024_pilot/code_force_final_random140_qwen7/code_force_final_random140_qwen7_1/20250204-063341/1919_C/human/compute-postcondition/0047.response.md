Output State: **`i` is 2, `b` must have at least one element, `s` is 1**

The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Given that `s` was initially unchanged and considering the initial state where `s` remains unchanged (implying its initial value is 0), the new value of `s` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
