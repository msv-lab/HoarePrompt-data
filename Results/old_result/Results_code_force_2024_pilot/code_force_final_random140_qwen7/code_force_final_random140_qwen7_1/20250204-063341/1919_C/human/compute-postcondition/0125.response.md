Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. If the last element of `a` is less than the second element of `lit`, then `a` remains unchanged except that `b` is a list containing the element `lit[1]`. Otherwise, `a` is modified such that its last element is now greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, and `a` includes an additional element which is `lit[1]`.
