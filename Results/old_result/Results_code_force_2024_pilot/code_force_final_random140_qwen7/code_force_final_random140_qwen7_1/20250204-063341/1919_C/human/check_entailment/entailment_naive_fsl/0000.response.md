Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not always find the optimal split of the array to minimize the penalty. Specifically, the program splits the array into two subsequences `a` and `b` such that each element of the original array is included in exactly one of the subsequences. However, the program's logic for determining which elements go into `a` and `b` is flawed. It simply appends elements to `a` if they are greater than the last element in `a`, and to `b` otherwise. This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
5
6
2 3 1 4 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
```

This happens because the program incorrectly splits the array into `[2, 3, 5, 6]` and `[1, 4]`, resulting in a penalty of 2 instead of the optimal penalty of 1. The optimal split would be `[2, 3, 5, 6]` and `[1, 4]`, but the program does not handle this case correctly.
