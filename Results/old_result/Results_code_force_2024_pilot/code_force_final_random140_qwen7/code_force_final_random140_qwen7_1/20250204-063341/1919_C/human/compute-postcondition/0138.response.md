Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, and `b` contains all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`.**

The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
