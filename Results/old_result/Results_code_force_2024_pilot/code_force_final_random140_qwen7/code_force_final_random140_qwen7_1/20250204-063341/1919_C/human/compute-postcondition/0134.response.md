Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` contains the element `lit[3]`, and `b` contains the element `lit[3]`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `a` now contains the element `lit[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, so it is still 3. The conditions regarding `n` and `b` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
