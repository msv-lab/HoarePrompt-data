Output State: **`i` is 3, `b` must have at least one element, `s` is 2**

The value of `s` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 1 (since it was not explicitly initialized to any other value in the provided context), making it 2. The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
