Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` contains the element `lit[2]` and `b` contains the element `lit[2]` if `a[-1] < lit[2]`, or `a` contains the element `lit[2]` and `b` also contains the element `lit[2]` if the condition `a[-1] < lit[2]` is false, and `b` now contains the element `lit[i]` which is `lit[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 3, `b` now contains the element `lit[3]`. The conditions regarding `a` and `b` remain unchanged unless the condition `a[-1] < lit[2]` changes, but since no new information about `a` is provided, we keep the original conditions.
