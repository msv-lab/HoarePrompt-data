Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` because `i` starts at `1` and goes up to but does not include `len(a)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is increased by 1.
   - `n` must be between `1` and `len(a)` inclusive.
   - `i` is `k + 1`, where `k` is the previous value of `i`.
   - These conditions hold true whether `a[i] > a[i - 1]` is true or false.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each time, the next value of `i` should be `k + 2` (i.e., the previous value of `i` plus `1`).
   - `n` must still be between `1` and `len(a)` inclusive.
   - `s` is already increased by `1` in the previous iteration, so it remains the same for the next iteration.
   - The condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` does not affect the increment of `i`, so it remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `n` must still be between `1` and `len(a)` inclusive.
   - `i` is now `k + 2`.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`s` is increased by 1, `n` must be between 1 and `len(a)` inclusive, `i` is `k + 2`**.
