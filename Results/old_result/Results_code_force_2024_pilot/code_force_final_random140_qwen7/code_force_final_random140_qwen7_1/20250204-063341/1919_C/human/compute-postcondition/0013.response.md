Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `b` is a list with one additional element
   - The postcondition states that if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, then the additional element in `b` is equal to `lit[i]`. If the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`, then the additional element in `b` is also equal to `lit[i]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration.

3. **Current State of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is now 2, the condition `i < n` will hold true if `n` is greater than 2.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged since they are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list with one additional element**.
