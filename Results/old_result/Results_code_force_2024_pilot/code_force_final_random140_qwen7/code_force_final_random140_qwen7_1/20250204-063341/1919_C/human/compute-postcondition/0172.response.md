Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `b`, `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`, and `s` will be the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its predecessor.

In natural language: The final state of the loop will have `i` equal to the length of `b`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of `b`. The list `b` will consist of all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`. The variable `s` will hold the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one.
