Postcondition: `i` is 3, `b` must have at least one element, and `s` is 2. If the element at index `i` in list `b` is greater than the element at index `i - 1`, the postcondition remains the same. If the element at index `i` is not greater than the element at index `i - 1`, the postcondition also remains the same since there is no else part to change anything.
