Output State: **`num_iterations` is the user input - 1, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, the last element of `a` is less than the current value of `lit[i]`**.

This means that the list `b` has been updated by appending the element `lit[i]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
