Output State: **`lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the integer input between 1 and \(10^4\).**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `lit`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned in the initial state and not used in the given code snippet.
