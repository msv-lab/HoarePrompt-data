Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the elements of `lit` in non-decreasing order, `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`, and `s` is 0.**

The code initializes `s` to 0. Since no operations are performed on `s` within the given code snippet, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `a`, and `b`) retain their states as described in the initial state.
