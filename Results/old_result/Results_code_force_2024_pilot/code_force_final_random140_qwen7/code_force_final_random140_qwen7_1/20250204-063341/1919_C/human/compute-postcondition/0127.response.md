Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - The postcondition for the loop is that if the last element of `a` is less than `lit[1]`, then `a` remains unchanged except `b` is a list containing the element `lit[1]`. Otherwise, `a` ends with an element that is `lit[1]` and `b` is a list containing the element `lit[1]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`, which is `2`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

4. **Postcondition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2 and `n` is still greater than 1, the condition `i < n` holds true.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
