Output State: **`lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the integer input between 1 and \(10^4\), `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `lit`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
