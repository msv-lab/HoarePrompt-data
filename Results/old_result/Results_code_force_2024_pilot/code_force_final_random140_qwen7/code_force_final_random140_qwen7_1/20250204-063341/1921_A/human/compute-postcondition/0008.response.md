Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input, `d` is the second integer from the input, `e` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the first integer from the input, `g` is an integer from the input, `h` is an integer from the input, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, and the current value of `x` is greater than `n`.**
