The function reads multiple sets of four coordinates from the user, calculates the squared distance between the first and third coordinates, and then compares it with the squared distance between the first and fourth coordinates. It prints the smaller of these two distances after each comparison. After processing all inputs, it does not return anything but leaves the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` holding the last set of input values, and `n` and `x` holding the minimum squared distance found during the comparisons.
