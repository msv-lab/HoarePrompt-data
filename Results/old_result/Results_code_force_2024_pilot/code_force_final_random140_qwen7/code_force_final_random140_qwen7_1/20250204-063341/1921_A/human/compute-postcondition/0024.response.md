Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are input integers, `e` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the first integer from the input, `g` is an integer from the input, `h` is an integer from the input, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `c` is updated to an input integer, `d` is updated to an input integer, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x > n`, then nothing specific changes. Otherwise, nothing specific changes.**
