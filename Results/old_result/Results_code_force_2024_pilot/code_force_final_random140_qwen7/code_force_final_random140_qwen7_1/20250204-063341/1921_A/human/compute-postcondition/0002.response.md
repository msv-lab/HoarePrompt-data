Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, steps is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively. The conditions for `t` and `steps` remain unchanged.
