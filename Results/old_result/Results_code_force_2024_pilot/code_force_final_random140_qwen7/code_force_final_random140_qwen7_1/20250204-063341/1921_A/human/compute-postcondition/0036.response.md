Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.**

This means the function checks if the provided coordinates of the corners of a square form a valid square with its sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The coordinates are provided in four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) within the range \([-1000, 1000]\). The function verifies if these points indeed form a square based on their positions.
