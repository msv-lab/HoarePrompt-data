Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, steps is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input, `d` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to variables `c` and `d`. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `steps` is still 0, `a` remains an input integer, and `b` remains an input integer. The new variables `c` and `d` are assigned the respective integers from the input.
