Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used to determine which pair of points represents the diagonal of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the squared distance between all pairs of points and prints the maximum distance found, which is not necessarily the diagonal of the square.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the opposite corners of the square. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the squared distance between opposite corners will be the largest among all distances. However, the program's current approach does not guarantee that the calculated distance is indeed the diagonal of the square.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
0 0
1 1
-1 -1
-2 -2
```

The correct output should be `4` (since the side length of the square is 2, and the area is \(2^2 = 4\)). However, the program will incorrectly calculate the distance between \((0, 0)\) and \((-2, -2)\), which is \(8\), and print `8` as the area.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
