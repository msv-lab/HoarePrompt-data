Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input, `d` is the second integer from the input, `e` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the first integer from the input, `g` is an integer from the input, `h` is an integer from the input, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, and `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `steps`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x`. The values of `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not referenced in the given code.
