Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, steps is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input, `d` is the second integer from the input, `e` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the first integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `e` and `f`. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. The input integers are stored in `e` and `f`, with `e` being the second integer and `f` being the first integer from the input.
