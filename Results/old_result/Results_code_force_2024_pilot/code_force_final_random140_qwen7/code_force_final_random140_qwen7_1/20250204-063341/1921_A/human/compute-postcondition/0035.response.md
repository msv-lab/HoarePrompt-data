Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be equal to the number of iterations executed, `steps` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will hold the last set of input values provided by the user, `n` will be the minimum value between the last calculated `n` and `x`, and `x` will be the last calculated value of `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` compared to the previous `n`.**

This means that after all iterations, `t` will reflect the total number of iterations, `steps` will be one less than `t` since it starts from 0. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will contain the values from the last input provided. The variable `n` will store the smallest value between all the `n` and `x` calculated during each iteration, ensuring it always holds the minimum distance squared found. The variable `x` will hold the latest comparison result between the distances squared.
