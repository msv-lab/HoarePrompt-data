Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
        
        x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be equal to the number of iterations executed, `steps` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will hold the last set of input values provided by the user, `n` will be the minimum value between the last calculated `n` and `x`, and `x` will be the last calculated value of `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` compared to the previous `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of four coordinates from the user, calculates the squared distance between the first and third coordinates, and then compares it with the squared distance between the first and fourth coordinates. It prints the smaller of these two distances after each comparison. After processing all inputs, it does not return anything but leaves the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` holding the last set of input values, and `n` and `x` holding the minimum squared distance found during the comparisons.
