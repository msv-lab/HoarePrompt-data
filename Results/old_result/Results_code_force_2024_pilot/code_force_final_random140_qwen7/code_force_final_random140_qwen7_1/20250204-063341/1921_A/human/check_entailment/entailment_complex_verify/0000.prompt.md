You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be equal to the number of iterations executed, `steps` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will hold the last set of input values provided by the user, `n` will be the minimum value between the last calculated `n` and `x`, and `x` will be the last calculated value of `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` compared to the previous `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of four coordinates from the user, calculates the squared distance between the first and third coordinates, and then compares it with the squared distance between the first and fourth coordinates. It prints the smaller of these two distances after each comparison. After processing all inputs, it does not return anything but leaves the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` holding the last set of input values, and `n` and `x` holding the minimum squared distance found during the comparisons.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used to determine which pair of points represents the diagonal of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the squared distance between all pairs of points and prints the maximum distance found, which is not necessarily the diagonal of the square.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the opposite corners of the square. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the squared distance between opposite corners will be the largest among all distances. However, the program's current approach does not guarantee that the calculated distance is indeed the diagonal of the square.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
0 0
1 1
-1 -1
-2 -2
```

The correct output should be `4` (since the side length of the square is 2, and the area is \(2^2 = 4\)). However, the program will incorrectly calculate the distance between \((0, 0)\) and \((-2, -2)\), which is \(8\), and print `8` as the area.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
