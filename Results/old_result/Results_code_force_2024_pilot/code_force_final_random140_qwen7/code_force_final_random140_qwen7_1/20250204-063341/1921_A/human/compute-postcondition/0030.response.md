Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `n` is (a - c)Â² + (b - d)Â²**.

This output state reflects that the variables `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `n` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `c`, and `b` and `d`.
