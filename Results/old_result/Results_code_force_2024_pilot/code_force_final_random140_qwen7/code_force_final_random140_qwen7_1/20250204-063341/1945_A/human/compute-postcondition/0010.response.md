Output State: **`p` is an integer, `q` is `q` plus `r`, `r` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `q += r` increments the value of `q` by the value of `r`. The initial values of `p`, `q`, and `r` were split from the input line, but now `line` is no longer valid as it has been consumed by the split operation. The value of `q` is updated to be its original value plus `r`, while `r` remains unchanged.
