Output State: **`p`, `q`, and `r` are integers assigned the values split from the input line, `line` is no longer valid as it has been consumed by the split operation**.

This means that the input line has been processed to extract three integer values which are assigned to `p`, `q`, and `r`. The original `line` variable is no longer valid since its content has been split and used.
