Output State: **`line` must be a valid line from standard input, `p` is the first integer from `line`, `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from `line` plus the third integer from `line`, and `r` is the third integer from `line`.**

Explanation: The code `q += r` increments the value of `q` by the value of `r`. Since `q` was initially the sum of the second and third integers from `line`, after executing the code, `q` becomes the sum of the second, third, and third integers from `line`. Therefore, `q` is now the sum of the second and twice the third integers from `line`.
