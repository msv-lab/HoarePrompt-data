Output State: **`line` must be a valid line from standard input, `p` is the first integer from `line`, `q` is the second integer from `line` plus the third integer from `line`, and `r` is the third integer from `line`.**

This means that the value of `q` has been updated to be the sum of its original value and the value of `r`, while `p` and `r` retain their original values, and `line` remains unchanged as it is still a valid line from standard input.
