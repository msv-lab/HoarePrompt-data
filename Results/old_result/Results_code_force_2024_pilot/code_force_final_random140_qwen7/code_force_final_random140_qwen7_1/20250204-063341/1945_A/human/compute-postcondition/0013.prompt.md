Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
    p, q, r = map(int, line.split())
    q += r
    print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `line` must be a valid line from standard input, `p` is the first integer from `line`, `q` is the second integer from `line` plus the third integer from `line`, and `r` is the third integer from `line`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `line` must be a valid line from standard input, `p` is the first integer from `line`, `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from `line` plus the third integer from `line`, and `r` is the third integer from `line`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p` is an integer, `q` is `q` plus `r`, `r` is an integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
