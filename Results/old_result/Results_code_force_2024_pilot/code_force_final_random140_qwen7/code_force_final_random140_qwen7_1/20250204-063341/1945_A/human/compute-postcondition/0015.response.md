Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it updates the value of `p` by subtracting one-third of `q` (where `q` is initially the sum of the second and third integers of the test case, and then incremented by the third integer) from `p`. The final state of `p` is the initial value minus the cumulative subtraction across all test cases. The function prints the result of this calculation for each test case.**
