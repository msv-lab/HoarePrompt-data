Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `p` will be an integer that started as the first integer from the first line of input minus the total number of times `q // 3` was calculated, `q` will be the sum of the second and third integers from each line of input plus the third integer from each line of input, and `r` will be the last third integer from the last line of input.

This means that `p` is adjusted by subtracting the quotient of `q` divided by 3 for each line processed, and `q` accumulates the sum of the second and third integers from each line plus the third integer from each line. `r` retains the value of the last third integer from the last line processed.
