Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem statement. The program initializes `soma` to 0 and then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (13 iterations in total), adding the result of `func_1(i)` to `soma`. However, the problem requires processing a list of test cases where each test case involves a different value of `n`, which is read from the input. The current implementation does not handle multiple test cases and instead processes a fixed set of values (0 to 12).

Moreover, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number, but it is being called with a range of values from 0 to 12, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Given the problem description, the program should read the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, read the value of `n`, and compute the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
