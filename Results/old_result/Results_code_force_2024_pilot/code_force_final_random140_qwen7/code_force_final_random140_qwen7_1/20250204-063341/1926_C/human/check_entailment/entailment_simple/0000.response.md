Reasoning:
- The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. 
- The annotated program initializes `soma` to 0 and then adds the result of `func_1(i)` for `i` in the range from 0 to 12. This means it calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 0 to 12, which is not relevant to the problem statement.
- The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases, and then printing the result for each test case.
- The provided code snippet does not handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement. It also does not account for multiple test cases.

Correctness: **False**
