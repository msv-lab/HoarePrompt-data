Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the first element of `a`, `h[i]` is 1, and `i` is not in `h`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to `h[i]`, where `i` is the first element of the list `a`. Since `i` was not initially in `h`, it remains unchanged in terms of its presence in `h`. The value of `a` and the condition that `i` is not in `h` remain the same as the initial state.
