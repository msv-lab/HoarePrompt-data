Postcondition: `h` is a dictionary, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, and `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element `i`. If `i` is in `h` and `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `h[i]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to have one key-value pair `{i: 1}`.
