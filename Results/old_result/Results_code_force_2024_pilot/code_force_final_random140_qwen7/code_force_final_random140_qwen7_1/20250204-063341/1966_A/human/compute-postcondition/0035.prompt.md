Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `h` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is equal to `k - 1`, `_` is an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (must contain at least one element), `h` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the first element of `a`) is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, `i` is the first element of `a`, and the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `ans` will be `k - 1`, `_` will retain its original value, `n` and `k` will remain unchanged, `a` will be a list of integers derived from splitting the input string, `h` will be a dictionary where the count of the first element in `a` is incremented, and the condition `h[i] >= k` will be true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is equal to `k - 1`, `_` is an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (must contain at least two elements), `h` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the first element of `a` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, and the key corresponding to the second element of `a` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, `i` is the second element of `a`, and the current value of `h[i]` is either greater than or equal to `k + 1` or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is equal to `k - 1`, `_` is an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (must contain at least three elements), `h` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the first element of `a` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, and the key corresponding to the third element of `a` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, `i` is the third element of `a`, and `h[i]` is incremented by 1 if it is greater than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
