Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. Additionally, a list of n integers c represents the numbers written on the cards, where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each i.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    h = {}
    ans = n
    for i in a:
        if i in h:
            h[i] += 1
        else:
            h[i] = 1
        if h[i] >= k:
            ams = k - 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ans` is equal to `k - 1`, `_` is an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (must contain at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop), `h` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to each element of `a` is incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise it is added as a new key with the value 1, and the value of `h[i]` for each `i` in `a` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, making `h[i]` greater than or equal to `k` for every `i` in `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will still be `k - 1`. The variable `_` retains its initial value, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `a` is a list of integers. The dictionary `h` will contain keys for each element in `a`, with their respective counts in `a`. For every element `i` in `a`, the count in `h` (`h[i]`) will be at least `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The dictionary `h` will contain the count of each element in the list `a`, incremented by 1 for each occurrence, such that for every element `i` in `a`, the value of `h[i]` will be greater than or equal to `k`. The variable `a` will be an empty list after all iterations of the loop have completed. The variable `ams` will be set to `k - 1` for each element in `a` that meets the condition `h[i] >= k`, but since `a` is emptied during the loop, `ams` will not be incremented beyond the initial value of `k - 1`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `h` will hold the frequency of each unique element in the original list `a`, with each frequency being at least `k`. The list `a` will be empty, and the variable `ams` will retain its value from the last iteration where the condition `h[i] >= k` was met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The final state of the loop will be as follows:

- `h` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
- `n` will remain as the input integer it was initialized as.
- `k` will remain as the input integer it was initialized as.
- `ans` will be equal to `k - 1` if any value in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `ans` will be equal to `n - 1`.
- `a` will be an empty list since it gets modified within the loop by incrementing the counts of its elements in the dictionary `h`.

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, the dictionary `h` will contain the frequency of each integer from the original list `a`. The variable `ans` will be adjusted based on whether any integer's frequency reaches or exceeds `k`. If it does, `ans` will be `k - 1`; otherwise, it will be `n - 1`. The list `a` will be empty because it is modified during each iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
