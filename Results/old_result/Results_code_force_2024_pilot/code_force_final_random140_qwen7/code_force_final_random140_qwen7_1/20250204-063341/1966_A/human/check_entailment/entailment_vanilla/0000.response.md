### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations. Each operation involves choosing `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards) and `k` (number of cards to be exchanged).
   - It then reads the list of card numbers.
   - A dictionary `h` is used to count occurrences of each card number.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, assuming initially all cards will remain.
   - For each card number, it checks if the count in the dictionary is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it sets `ams` to `k-1`, but does not update `ans`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The code does not correctly update `ans` based on the operations. Specifically, it should reduce the count of cards by `k-1` when `h[i] >= k`.
   - The logic for updating `ans` is missing. Instead, it only sets `ams` to `k-1` without reducing the total count of cards.
   - The final value of `ans` remains unchanged and is always set to the initial value of `n`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each card number, if its count is divisible by `k`, the number of cards can be reduced by `k-1` for each complete set of `k` cards.
   - The final count of cards should be the sum of the minimum number of cards left for each unique card number.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        h = {}
        for i in a:
            if i in h:
                h[i] += 1
            else:
                h[i] = 1
        ans = 0
        for count in h.values():
            ans += count % k
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:

The original code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards left. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
