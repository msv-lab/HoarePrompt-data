Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of `a`, and `h[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `h[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the index `i` in the list `h`. Given that `i` is the second element of `a`, `h[i]` (which is the same as `h[1]` if `a` is zero-indexed) is now 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
