Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, it also accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `c` where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each i. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified conditions.**

This means the function `func` takes three main inputs: an integer `t` (with constraints 1 to 500), followed by multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `k` (with their respective constraints) and a list of `n` integers `c` (each within the range 1 to 100). The function then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a result accordingly.
