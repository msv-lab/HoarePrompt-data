Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. This means the loop will continue until the input is zero.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**: Since the loop relies on user input, the initial state should reflect that the input is valid and non-zero. Given the constraints, the input should be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the one that will be read by `int(input())`. Therefore, the input must be a non-zero integer within the specified range.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`_` is set to an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**
