Output State: **`h` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ams` retains its value from the last iteration where the condition `h[i] >= k` was met, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `h`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `ams`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
