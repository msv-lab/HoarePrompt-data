Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ams` retains its value from the last iteration where the condition `h[i] >= k` was met, the input value controlling the loop will be decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by space, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. It does not affect the list `a` or the variable `h`. The variable `ams` retains its value from the last iteration where the condition `h[i] >= k` was met, and the input value controlling the loop (which is `n`) will be decreased by 1.
