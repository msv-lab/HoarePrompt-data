Output State: **`_` is an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The variable `_` from the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, `_` is still an integer value between 1 and 500 (inclusive), while `n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user.
