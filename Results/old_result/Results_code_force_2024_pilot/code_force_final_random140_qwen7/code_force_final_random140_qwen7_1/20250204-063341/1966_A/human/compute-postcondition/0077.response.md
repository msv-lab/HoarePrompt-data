Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ams` retains its value from the last iteration where the condition `h[i] >= k` was met, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `ams` retains its value from the last iteration where the condition `h[i] >= k` was met, as mentioned in the initial state.
