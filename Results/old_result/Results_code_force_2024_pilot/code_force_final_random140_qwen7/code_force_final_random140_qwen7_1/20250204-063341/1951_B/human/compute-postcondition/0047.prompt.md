You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 100000.
    #
    #In this scenario, the loop continues to execute until the condition `a[i] > a[k - 1]` is met or all elements in the list `a` have been checked. Since the loop has executed 3 times and `wins` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where the condition is not met, it implies that the first three elements in the list `a` are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`. However, the loop will continue to run for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, as there's no indication that the condition `a[i] > a[k - 1]` was ever met within the first 3 iterations. Therefore, after all iterations, `wins` will be equal to `n`, assuming none of the elements in `a` are greater than `a[k-1]`. Given the constraints, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is 100000 in the upper limit of `n`.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: 99999
    #State: `wins` is 100000, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 99999, and the condition `wins >= k` is true.
    wins_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 100001, `wins_with_swap` is 100100, `i` is 101000.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `wins_with_swap` (which starts at 100001) to `k-1`. Given that the loop executes 3 times as per the provided information, we can infer that `wins_with_swap` will increment by 1 each iteration until it reaches `k-1`. If the loop executed 3 times, `wins_with_swap` would start at 100001 and end at 100013. Since the loop continues to increment `wins_with_swap` until it reaches `k-1`, and given the pattern, if the loop were to execute all its iterations, `wins_with_swap` would reach 100100 (incrementing from 100001 to 100100, which is 100 increments). The variable `i` would then be equal to `wins_with_swap` at the last increment, making it 101000. The value of `wins` remains unchanged at 100001 as it is not affected by the loop.
    print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))
    #This is printed: 100000
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a single integer `t`, and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers where each integer in `a` is between 1 and 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given conditions.
