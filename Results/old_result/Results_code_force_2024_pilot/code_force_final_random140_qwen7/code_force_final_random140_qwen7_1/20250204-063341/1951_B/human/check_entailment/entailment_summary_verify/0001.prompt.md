You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

    7 2 727 10 12 13

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins += 1
    if wins >= k:
        print(wins - 1)
    wins_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins_with_swap += 1
    print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` and two integers `n` and `k`. It counts how many elements in `a` are less than or equal to the `k-1`th element of `a`. If the count is at least `k`, it performs a second count starting from the position just after the first count ends, up to `k-1`. Finally, it prints the maximum of two values: one derived from the first count minus one, and the other from the second count adjusted by the first count and considering if the first count was non-zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of matches the cow at position `k` can win.
   - We can either do nothing or swap the cow at position `k` with another cow to maximize its chances of winning.

2. **Initial Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (the index of the cow).
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows.
   - The code calculates the number of wins without any swap (`wins`) and then considers the possibility of swapping the cow at position `k` with another cow to potentially increase the number of wins (`wins_with_swap`).

3. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - **Without Swap:**
     - The loop iterates through the list of ratings and counts how many cows have a higher rating than the cow at position `k-1`.
     - If the number of such cows is greater than or equal to `k`, the cow at position `k` cannot win all these matches, so we print `wins - 1`.
     - Otherwise, we print `wins`.

   - **With Swap:**
     - The loop starts from the position where the cow at `k` would have won without the swap (`wins_with_swap`).
     - It continues to count how many cows have a higher rating than the cow at position `k-1` starting from this position.
     - The final result is the maximum of the wins without swap and the adjusted wins with swap.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for counting wins without swap is correct.
   - The logic for considering the swap is also correct, as it checks if the cow at position `k` can win more matches by swapping with a cow with a lower rating.
   - The final result is correctly calculated by taking the maximum of the two scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k` by either doing nothing or swapping with another cow.

### Correctness:
**True**
