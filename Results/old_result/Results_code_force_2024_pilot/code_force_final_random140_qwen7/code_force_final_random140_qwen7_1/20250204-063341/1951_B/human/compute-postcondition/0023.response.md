Based on the initial state provided:

- `wins` is explicitly given as 100000.
- `i` is explicitly given as 99999.
- The condition `wins >= k` is true, but the exact value of `k` is not specified, so it could be any integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
- `t`, `n`, and `a` are not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(wins - 1)
```

Given that `wins` is 100000, the expression `wins - 1` evaluates to 99999.

Output: **99999**
