You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.

    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 100000.
    #
    #In this scenario, the loop continues to execute until the condition `a[i] > a[k - 1]` is met or all elements in the list `a` have been checked. Since the loop has executed 3 times and `wins` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where the condition is not met, it implies that the first three elements in the list `a` are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`. However, the loop will continue to run for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, as there's no indication that the condition `a[i] > a[k - 1]` was ever met within the first 3 iterations. Therefore, after all iterations, `wins` will be equal to `n`, assuming none of the elements in `a` are greater than `a[k-1]`. Given the constraints, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is 100000 in the upper limit of `n`.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)

    #State: Output State: `wins` is 100001, `wins_with_swap` is 100100, `i` is 101000.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `wins_with_swap` (which starts at 100001) to `k-1`. Given that the loop executes 3 times as per the provided information, we can infer that `wins_with_swap` will increment by 1 each iteration until it reaches `k-1`. If the loop executed 3 times, `wins_with_swap` would start at 100001 and end at 100013. Since the loop continues to increment `wins_with_swap` until it reaches `k-1`, and given the pattern, if the loop were to execute all its iterations, `wins_with_swap` would reach 100100 (incrementing from 100001 to 100100, which is 100 increments). The variable `i` would then be equal to `wins_with_swap` at the last increment, making it 101000. The value of `wins` remains unchanged at 100001 as it is not affected by the loop.
    print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))
    #This is printed: 100000



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of matches the cow at position `k` can win.
   - We can either do nothing or swap the cow at position `k` with another cow to maximize its chances of winning.

2. **Initial Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (the index of the cow).
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows.
   - The code calculates the number of wins without any swap (`wins`) and then considers the possibility of swapping the cow at position `k` with another cow to potentially increase the number of wins (`wins_with_swap`).

3. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - **Without Swap:**
     - The loop iterates through the list of ratings and counts how many cows have a higher rating than the cow at position `k-1`.
     - If the number of such cows is greater than or equal to `k`, the cow at position `k` cannot win all these matches, so we print `wins - 1`.
     - Otherwise, we print `wins`.

   - **With Swap:**
     - The loop starts from the position where the cow at `k` would have won without the swap (`wins_with_swap`).
     - It continues to count how many cows have a higher rating than the cow at position `k-1` starting from this position.
     - The final result is the maximum of the wins without swap and the adjusted wins with swap.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for counting wins without swap is correct.
   - The logic for considering the swap is also correct, as it checks if the cow at position `k` can win more matches by swapping with a cow with a lower rating.
   - The final result is correctly calculated by taking the maximum of the two scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k` by either doing nothing or swapping with another cow.

### Correctness:
**True**
