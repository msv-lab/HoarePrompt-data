Output State: `wins` is 100001, `wins_with_swap` is 100100, `i` is 101000.

Explanation: The loop runs from `wins_with_swap` (which starts at 100001) to `k-1`. Given that the loop executes 3 times as per the provided output states, we can infer that `k` must be at least 101002 (since `i` increments by 1 each iteration and reaches 100002 after 3 iterations). The loop increments `wins_with_swap` each time it runs without breaking, so after 100000 iterations (from 100001 to 200000 inclusive), `wins_with_swap` would be 100101. However, since the loop only ran 3 times based on the given states, `wins_with_swap` would be 100013 + 99970 = 100100 after all iterations. The value of `i` would be `wins_with_swap + 1`, which is 100101 - 1 = 101000.
