Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
        print(k // 2 + 1)
    else:
        print(ceil(k / 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, then no changes are made to `n` and `k`. Otherwise, the condition `(k % 2 != 0 or k // 2 % 2 == 0)` holds true, which means either `k` is odd or `k // 2` is even, and no changes are made to `n` and `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\), `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, the program does not change the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 999\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string. If `k` is even and the integer obtained by dividing `k` by 2 and then taking it modulo 2 is odd, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
