Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, then no changes are made to `n` and `k`. Otherwise, the condition `(k % 2 != 0 or k // 2 % 2 == 0)` holds true, which means either `k` is odd or `k // 2` is even, and no changes are made to `n` and `k`.
