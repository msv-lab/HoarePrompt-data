Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. It then assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000.
