You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each involving two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it calculates and prints either \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\) or \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\) based on the condition that \(k\) is even and \(\frac{k}{2}\) is odd. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd.
     - If this condition is true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Diagonal Considerations**:
   - A square grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
   - We need to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Let's consider the conditions under which the program's logic might fail:
     - **Case 1**: When `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd.
       - This means \( k \) is an even number where \( k // 2 \) is an odd number.
       - For example, if \( k = 6 \), \( k // 2 = 3 \) (odd), and the program prints `3 + 1 = 4`.
       - This seems to be correct because we need to color enough cells to cover the required diagonals.
     - **Case 2**: When `k` is not even or `k // 2` is not odd.
       - For example, if \( k = 5 \), the program prints `ceil(5 / 2) = 3`.
       - This also seems to be correct because we need to cover the required diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

5. **General Logic**:
   - The logic in the program is based on the parity of `k` and the division by 2.
   - The `ceil` function ensures that we round up when necessary, which is important for ensuring we meet the requirement of covering at least `k` diagonals.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic correctly handles the conditions to find the minimum number of cells needed to color such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
