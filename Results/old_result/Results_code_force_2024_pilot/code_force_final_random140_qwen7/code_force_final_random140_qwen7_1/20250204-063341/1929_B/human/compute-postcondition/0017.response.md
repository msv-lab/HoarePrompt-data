Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 999\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from the input string.
- `k` is the second integer input split from the input string.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(k // 2 + 1)`.

Let's break it down:
1. `k` is an integer input from the user.
2. The expression `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
3. Adding 1 to the result of the integer division gives us the final value that will be printed.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the second integer input split from the input string)**
