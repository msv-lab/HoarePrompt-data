Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.

The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2. The ceiling function (`ceil`) rounds up to the nearest integer if the result of the division is not an integer.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the output. However, we can describe it in terms of `k`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2)**
