Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 999\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from the input string.
- `k` is the second integer input split from the input string.

We need to determine the value of `ceil(k / 2)` when the print statement is executed.

Since the values of `n` and `k` are derived from the input string, let's denote them as follows:
- Let `n` be the first integer from the input string.
- Let `k` be the second integer from the input string.

The expression `ceil(k / 2)` means taking the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer if the division result is not an integer.

Let's break it down:
1. `k / 2` gives the division result.
2. `ceil(k / 2)` rounds this result up to the nearest integer.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, we can describe the output in general terms.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the ceiling of k divided by 2)**
