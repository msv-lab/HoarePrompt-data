Output State: **The variable `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, and `k` is the last integer input split from the input string after all iterations of the loop. No changes are made to `n` and `k` unless the conditions specified in the loop body are met.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `t` will be reduced by the number of times the loop has executed (since each iteration consumes one value of `t`), but it will never go below 0. The values of `n` and `k` will be the ones provided as inputs for the last iteration of the loop, and they will not be changed unless the specific conditions in the loop body are met.
