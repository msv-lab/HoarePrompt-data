Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 999\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string. If `k` is even and the integer obtained by dividing `k` by 2 and then taking it modulo 2 is odd, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
