Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer, and it is specified that `k` is even but `k/2` is odd.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(k // 2 + 1)`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `k` is even, it can be expressed as `k = 2m` where `m` is an integer.
2. Given that `k/2` is odd, substituting `k = 2m` gives us `(2m)/2 = m`, so `m` must be odd.
3. Therefore, `k = 2m` where `m` is an odd integer.
4. When we perform integer division `k // 2`, it results in `m` because `k = 2m` and dividing by 2 gives `m`.
5. Adding 1 to `m` (which is odd) results in an even number.

Thus, the expression `k // 2 + 1` evaluates to an even number that is one more than an odd number `m`.

Output: **an even number (where the number is k//2 + 1, with k being an even number such that k/2 is odd)**
