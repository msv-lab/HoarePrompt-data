Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median` for `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `operations`, or the condition that `n` is an input integer. However, it changes the state of the list `a` to be sorted.
