Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program simply counts the occurrences of the median value in the sorted array, which is not the correct approach.

To solve this problem, we need to find the median value and then determine how many operations are needed to make all elements greater than or equal to the next highest value after the median. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        a.sort()
        median_index = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median_value = a[median_index]
        
        # Count how many elements are less than the median
        count_less_than_median = sum(1 for x in a if x < median_value)
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        min_operations = count_less_than_median
        
        print(min_operations)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array, finds the median index, counts how many elements are less than the median, and calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all elements greater than or equal to the next highest value after the median.
