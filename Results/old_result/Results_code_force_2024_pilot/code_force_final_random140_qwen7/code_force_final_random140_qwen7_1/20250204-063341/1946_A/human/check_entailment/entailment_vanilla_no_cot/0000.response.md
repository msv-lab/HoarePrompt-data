Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Median**: The program calculates the count of the median element in the sorted array starting from the median index `p`. This is not the correct approach to finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

2. **Logic for Minimum Operations**: To correctly solve the problem, you need to determine how many operations are required to make the current median the smallest possible value greater than the current median. This involves comparing the median with its neighboring elements and calculating the necessary increments.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median = a[p]
        # Calculate the target median value which is one more than the current median
        target_median = median + 1
        # Count the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        for i in range(p, n):
            if a[i] < target_median:
                operations += target_median - a[i]
            else:
                break
        print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Sorts the array.
- Determines the median index `p`.
- Sets the target median to be one more than the current median.
- Iterates through the array from the median index to the end, counting the number of operations needed to make all elements from the median position onwards equal to the target median.
