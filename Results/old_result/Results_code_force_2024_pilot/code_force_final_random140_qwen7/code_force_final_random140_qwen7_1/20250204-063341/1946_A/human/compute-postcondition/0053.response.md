Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `operations` is 0, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is (n), `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is (n // 2), `median` is a[median_index], `median_index` is updated to n // 2, `median` is a[median_index]**.

Explanation: The line `operations = 0` sets the variable `operations` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
