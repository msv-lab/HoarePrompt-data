Output State: **`operations` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[median_index]`**.

Explanation: The line `operations = 0` sets the variable `operations` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `median_index`, `median`) retain their previous values as no operation was performed on them in the given code snippet.
