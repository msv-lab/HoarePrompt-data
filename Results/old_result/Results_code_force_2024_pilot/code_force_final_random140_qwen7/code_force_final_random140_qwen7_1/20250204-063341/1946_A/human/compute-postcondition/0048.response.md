Output State: **`operations` is the sum of (\`median` - a[i]) for all i in the range (0) to (n-1) where a[i] < \`median\`; `t` must be greater than 1; `i` is (n); `n` must be at least 1; `median_index` is (n // 2); `median` is a[median_index]; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables (`operations`, `t`, `i`, `median_index`, `median`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
