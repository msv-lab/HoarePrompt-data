Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `operations` is increased by `median - a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `operations` variable by adding `median - a[i]` to it. Given that `a[1] < median`, the value of `operations` is increased by `median - a[1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
