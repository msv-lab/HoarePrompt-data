Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the array a contains n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

Explanation: The given code is an empty block (docstring) without any operations that would change the values of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
