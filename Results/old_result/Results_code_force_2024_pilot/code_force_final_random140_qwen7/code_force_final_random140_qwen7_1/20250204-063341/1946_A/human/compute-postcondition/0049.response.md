Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `operations` is the sum of (`median` - a[i]) for all i in the range (0) to (n-1) where a[i] < `median`; `t` must be greater than 1; `i` is (n); `n` is an input integer; `median_index` is (n // 2); `median` is a[median_index]**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts each integer into a list. This affects the variable `a`, making it a list of integers. The other variables (`operations`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `median_index`, and `median`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
