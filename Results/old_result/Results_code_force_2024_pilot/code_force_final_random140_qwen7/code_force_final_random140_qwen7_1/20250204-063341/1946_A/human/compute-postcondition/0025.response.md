Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order, calculates the middle index `p` based on `n`, and counts the occurrences of the element at index `p` in the subarray starting from `p`. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.**
