Output: **res (where res is the count of a[p] in the subarray a[p:])**

Explanation:
- `t` is a positive integer (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer representing the length of the array `a`.
- `a` is a sorted array containing `n` integers, with each integer being an input separated by spaces.
- `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This means `p` is the index of the middle element in the array `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even.
- `res` is the count of `a[p]` in the subarray `a[p:]`, which includes all elements from index `p` to the end of the array `a`.

The print statement outputs the value of `res`, which is the count of how many times the middle element `a[p]` appears in the subarray starting from `a[p]` to the end of the array `a`.
