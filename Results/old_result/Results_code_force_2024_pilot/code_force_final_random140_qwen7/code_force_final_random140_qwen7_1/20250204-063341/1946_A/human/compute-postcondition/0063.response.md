Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - From the postcondition given, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `operations` is either increased by `median - a[1]` if `a[1] < median`, or remains unchanged if `a[1] >= median`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function, at the start of the first iteration, `i` should be set to 0.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `operations` remains unchanged because the loop hasn't executed yet, and no changes to `operations` have been specified for the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and `operations` remains unchanged**.
