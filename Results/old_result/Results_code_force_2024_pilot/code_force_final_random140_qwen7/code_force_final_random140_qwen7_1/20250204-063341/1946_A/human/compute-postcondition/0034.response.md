Output State: **`operations` is `median - a[i]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[median_index]`.**

Explanation: The value of `operations` is updated by adding `median - a[i]` to its current value, which was 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
