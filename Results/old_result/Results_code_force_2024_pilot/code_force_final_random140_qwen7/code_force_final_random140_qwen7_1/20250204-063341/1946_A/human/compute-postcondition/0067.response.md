Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` will remain a positive integer, and `operations` will be the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i] < median`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the length of the list `a`, `n` will still be the same positive integer it started as, and `operations` will hold the total of `median - a[i]` for every element `a[i]` in the list that is less than the median value.
