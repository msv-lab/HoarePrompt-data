Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, and the array `a` is updated to contain `n` integers where each integer is an input separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The array `a` now contains `n` integers, which are the inputs provided by the user.
