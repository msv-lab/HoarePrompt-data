Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and `operations` is increased by `median - a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `operations += median - a[i]` updates the value of `operations` by adding `median - a[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 0 initially, `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[0]`. Since `a[0]` is less than the median, the value of `operations` is increased by the difference between the median and `a[0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
