Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `operations` is updated to `median - a[1]` if `a[1]` is less than `median`, otherwise it retains the previous value.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `median` is `a[median_index]`.
- If `a[i] < median`, `operations` is further updated to `operations + (median - a[i])` and `i` is set to 1.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The other variables (`operations`, `median_index`, `median`, `n`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Updated States for the Start of the Next Iteration
- `operations` remains the same unless modified within the loop body.
- `median_index` remains `n // 2` unless modified within the loop body.
- `median` remains `a[median_index]` unless modified within the loop body.
- `i` will be `i + 1`.

Given that no modifications are specified for `operations`, `median_index`, or `median` in the loop head, these states remain unchanged.

### Final Answer
State: **`operations` is updated to `median - a[1]` if `a[1]` is less than `median`, otherwise it retains the previous value; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `median` is `a[median_index]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In a more concise form:
State: **`operations` is updated to `median - a[1]` if `a[1]` is less than `median`, otherwise it retains the previous value; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `median` is `a[median_index]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
