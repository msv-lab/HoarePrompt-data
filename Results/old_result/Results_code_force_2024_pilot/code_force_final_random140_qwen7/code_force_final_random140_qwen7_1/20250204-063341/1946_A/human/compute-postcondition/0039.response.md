Postcondition: `operations` is `median - a[1]` if `a[1]` is less than `median`, otherwise it retains the previous value; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `median` is `a[median_index]`; if `a[i] < median`, `operations` is updated to `operations + (median - a[i])` and `i` is 1; otherwise, `i` remains 1 and `operations` retains its previous value.
