Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. It then performs operations based on these inputs and returns outputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of elements in an array (`n`), the length of the array, and the array itself. The function processes each test case and returns results accordingly for each one.
