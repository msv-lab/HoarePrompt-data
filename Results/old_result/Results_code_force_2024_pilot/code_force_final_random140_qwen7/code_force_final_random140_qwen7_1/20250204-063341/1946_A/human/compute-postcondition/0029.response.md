Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `operations` is the sum of `median - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `median` for `i` in the range of `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[median_index]` to the variable `median`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `median_index`, and `operations`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
