Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `operations` is the sum of (`median` - a[i]) for all i in the range (0) to (n-1) where a[i] < `median`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is (n), `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is (n // 2), `median` is a[median_index]**.

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `operations`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `median_index`, and `median` remain unchanged from their initial states.
