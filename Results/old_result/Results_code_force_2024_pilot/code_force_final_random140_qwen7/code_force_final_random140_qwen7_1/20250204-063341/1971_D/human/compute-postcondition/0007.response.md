Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `a` is a non-empty string, `cut` is 1, `i` is 0.**

The value of `cut` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `t`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged. The current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0' also remain the same.
