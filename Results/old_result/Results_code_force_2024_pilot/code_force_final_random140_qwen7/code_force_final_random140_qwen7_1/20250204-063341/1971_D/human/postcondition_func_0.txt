The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It counts the number of times the character '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the string `s` for each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints the count for each case and sets the value of `t` to 0. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
