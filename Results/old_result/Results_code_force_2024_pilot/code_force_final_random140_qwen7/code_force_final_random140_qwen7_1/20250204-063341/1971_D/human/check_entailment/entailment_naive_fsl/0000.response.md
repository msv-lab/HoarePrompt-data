Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. The logic in the program only counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0', which is not always the correct approach.

For example, consider the input string "010101":
- The program would count 2 transitions ('1' to '0') and output 3 pieces.
- However, the correct answer is 2 pieces: "01" and "010".

This counterexample shows that the program does not handle all cases correctly, hence the correctness is False.
