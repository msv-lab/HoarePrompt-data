Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of pieces required to sort the binary string. The logic in the program assumes that every occurrence of '10' requires a separate piece, but this is not always true.

For example, consider the string "11010". According to the program's logic, there are two occurrences of '10', so it would output 3 pieces. However, the correct solution is to split the string into "110" and "10", which can be rearranged into "00111" using just 2 pieces.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1'. Each transition indicates the start of a new piece because once we encounter a '1' after a '0', all subsequent '1's must be in a different piece to ensure the final string is sorted.

Here's the corrected logic:
- Initialize a counter `cut` to 0.
- Iterate through the string and increment `cut` every time a '0' is followed by a '1'.
- The result should be `cut + 1` because the last piece will include any remaining '1's or '0's at the end of the string.

Given this analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
