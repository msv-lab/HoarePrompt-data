Output State: **`cut` is 3, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `t` is `t - 2`**

Explanation: The variable `cut` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, `i` is still `len(a) - 2` and `t` is still `t - 2`.
