Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues to execute as long as there are consecutive characters '1' followed by '0' in the string `a`.

2. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop uses an underscore `_` as the iterator, which means it does not directly use `i`, `t`, or `a` as part of its condition. However, the loop will run `t` times, and each iteration checks the string `a` for consecutive '1' followed by '0'.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cut` contains the total count of occurrences of '1' followed by '0'.
   - `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`.
   - `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 500, unchanged by the loop.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, it will be decremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `t` should be `t - 1`.

Since the loop does not directly use `i` or `cut` as part of its condition, these values do not change within the loop itself and remain the same for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cut` is the total count of occurrences of '1' followed by '0', `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `t` is `t - 1`**
