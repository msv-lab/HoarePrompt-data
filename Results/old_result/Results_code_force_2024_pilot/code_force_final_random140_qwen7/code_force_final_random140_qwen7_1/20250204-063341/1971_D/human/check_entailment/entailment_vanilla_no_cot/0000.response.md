Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only counts the number of cuts where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0'. This approach does not always yield the minimum number of pieces required.

For example, consider the input `1001`. According to the program's logic, it would count one cut at index 0 ('1' followed by '0'), and the output would be `2` (cut + 1). However, the correct answer should be `1`, as we can split the string into `['1', '001']` and rearrange them to form a sorted binary string.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the positions where the sequence changes from '0' to '1'. The number of such transitions plus one will give us the minimum number of pieces needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        last_char = '0'
        for char in a:
            if char != last_char:
                cut += 1
                last_char = char
        # We need one more piece if the string starts with '1'
        if a[0] == '1':
            cut += 1
        print(cut)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.
