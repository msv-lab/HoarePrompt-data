Postcondition: `cut` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is the input string, and if the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is set to 1. If the condition `a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0'` is not met, the values of `cut`, `i`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.
