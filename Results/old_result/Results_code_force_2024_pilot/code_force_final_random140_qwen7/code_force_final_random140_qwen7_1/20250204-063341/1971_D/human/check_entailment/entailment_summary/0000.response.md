Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of times '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the binary string. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the positions where the string changes from '0' to '1'. Each such change indicates the end of one piece and the start of another. Therefore, the number of such changes plus one will give us the minimum number of pieces required.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The logic only counts consecutive '10' pairs, which is insufficient.
- For example, in the string "1001", the program would count only one '10' pair, leading to an incorrect result of 2 pieces instead of the correct answer of 3 pieces.

A correct approach would be to iterate through the string and count the transitions from '0' to '1'. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        prev_char = '0'
        for char in a:
            if prev_char == '0' and char == '1':
                cut += 1
            prev_char = char
        print(cut + 1)
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the transitions from '0' to '1' and adds one to get the minimum number of pieces.

Given the reasoning above, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
