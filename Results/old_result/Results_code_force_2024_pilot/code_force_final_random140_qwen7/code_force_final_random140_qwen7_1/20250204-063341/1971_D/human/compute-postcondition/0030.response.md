Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the condition `range(len(a) - 1)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `cut` is 1
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2`
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `a` is the input string

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(len(a) - 1)`. This means `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(a) - 2`.

4. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(a) - 2`.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `len(a) - 1`.

6. **Adjust Other States**: The other states (`cut`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged unless the loop body changes them. Since the problem does not specify any changes to these variables within the loop body, they remain as they are.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cut` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is the input string**
