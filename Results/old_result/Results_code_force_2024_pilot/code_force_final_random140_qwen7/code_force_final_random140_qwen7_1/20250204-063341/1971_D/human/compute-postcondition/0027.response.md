Output State: **`cut` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is the input string, and the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `cut` was initially 0 and it is incremented by 1, so now `cut` is 1. The values of `i`, `t`, `a`, `a[i]`, and `a[i + 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
