You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        print(cut + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It counts the number of times the character '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the string `s` for each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints the count for each case and sets the value of `t` to 0. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of cuts required to split a binary string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's before all '1's).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
   - It initializes a counter `cut` to zero.
   - It iterates through the string, checking if a '1' is followed by a '0'. If so, it increments the `cut` counter.
   - Finally, it prints `cut + 1`.

3. **Analysis of Logic**:
   - The logic assumes that every time a '1' is followed by a '0', a cut is needed. This is not always true. For example, consider the string "1100". According to the current logic, it would require 2 cuts (at positions 2 and 3), but we can actually rearrange it with just 1 cut (after the second '1') to get "0011".
   - The logic does not account for the possibility of multiple '1's being together followed by multiple '0's, which could potentially be handled with fewer cuts.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should count the number of transitions from '0' to '1'. Each transition indicates a place where the string can be split to ensure all '0's come before all '1's.
   - Additionally, if the string starts with '1' or ends with '0', we need an extra piece.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it incorrectly counts the number of cuts needed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
