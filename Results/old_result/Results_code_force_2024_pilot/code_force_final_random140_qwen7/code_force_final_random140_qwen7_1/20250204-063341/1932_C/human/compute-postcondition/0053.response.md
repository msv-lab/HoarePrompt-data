Based on the initial state described, let's break down the process:

1. **String `s`**: This is a non-empty string. Each character in `s` dictates the direction of multiplication for the product `p` and updates it accordingly.
2. **List `arr`**: This list contains the elements that will be multiplied to form `p`.
3. **Variables `l` and `r`**: These are indices used to traverse the `arr` list from the left and right, respectively.
4. **Variable `p`**: This variable holds the product of the elements from `arr` based on the direction specified by `s`, and it is taken modulo `m` at each step.
5. **List `ans`**: This list stores all intermediate values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, with the final value of `p` being the last element in `ans`.

The code snippet `print(*ans[::-1])` will print the elements of `ans` in reverse order. Since `ans` contains all intermediate values of `p`, reversing it and printing it will give us the values of `p` in the order they were computed during the loop execution.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `s`, `arr`, and `m` are not provided, but we know that `ans` contains all the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration. Therefore, the output will be the reversed list of these intermediate values.

Output: **[all intermediate values of p in reverse order]**
