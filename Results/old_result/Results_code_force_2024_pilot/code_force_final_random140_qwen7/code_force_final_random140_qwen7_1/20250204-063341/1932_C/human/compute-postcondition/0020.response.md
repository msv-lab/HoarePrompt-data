Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a non-empty string (with the first character removed), `l` is 2 if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 2` if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1. Depending on the next character in `s`, `r` was originally `n - 1` if the next character is 'L', or `n - 2` if the next character is not 'L'. After decrementing `r` by 1, if the next character in `s` is 'L', `r` becomes `n - 2`; otherwise, `r` becomes `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
