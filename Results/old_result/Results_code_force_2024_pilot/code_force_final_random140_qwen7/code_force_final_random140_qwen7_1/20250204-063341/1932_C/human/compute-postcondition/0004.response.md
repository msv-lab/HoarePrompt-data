Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `l` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `l` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, or `s`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged, and only `l` is updated to 0.
