Output State: **`r` is decreased by 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in `s`, if `k` was 'L' in the previous iteration, `l` is 1 more than its original value, if `k` was not 'L', `r` is decreased by 1.**

This means that `r` has been decreased by 1, while the other variables (`s`, `k`, `l`) retain their previous states unless specified otherwise.
