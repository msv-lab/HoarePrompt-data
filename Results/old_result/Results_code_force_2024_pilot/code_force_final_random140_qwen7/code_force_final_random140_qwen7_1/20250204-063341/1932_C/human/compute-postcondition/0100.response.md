Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is -1, `r` is either 2 or 1, `p` is `arr[2] * arr[-1] % m` or 0, `ans` is a list containing 0 and `arr[2]` or 0, `strr` is `next_strr` (not equal to 'R')**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `p * arr[l] % m`. Given that `l` is -1, `p` becomes `arr[2] * arr[-1] % m` if `p` was originally `arr[2]` or 0, otherwise, it remains 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
