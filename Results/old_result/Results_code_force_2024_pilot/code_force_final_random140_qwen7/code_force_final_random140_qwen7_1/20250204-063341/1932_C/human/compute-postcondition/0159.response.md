Output State: **`l` is decremented by 1; `p` is `p * arr[l] % m`; `ans` contains the updated value of `p` based on the next character from `s`; `strr` remains 'y'.**

Explanation: The value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. Since `l` is decremented by 1, its new value is one less than its previous value. The value of `ans` is updated to reflect the new value of `p` based on the next character from `s`. The value of `strr` remains unchanged as 'y'.
