Output State: **`strr` is 'R', `r` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `strr` was initially set to be the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]`, and its value was 'R'. The code snippet `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated value of `r` and retains the value of `strr`.
