Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is -1, `r` is either 2 or 1, `p` is either `arr[2]` or 0, `ans` is a list containing 0 and `arr[2]` or 0, `strr` is `next_strr` (not equal to 'R')**.

The value of `l` is decremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `l` was either 0 or -1, decrementing it by 1 results in `l` being -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
