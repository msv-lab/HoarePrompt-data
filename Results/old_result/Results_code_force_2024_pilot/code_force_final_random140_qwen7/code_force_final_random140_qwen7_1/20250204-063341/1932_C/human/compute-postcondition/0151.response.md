Output State: **`p` is updated to the value of `p * arr[l] % m`, `ans` contains the updated value of `p`, `l` is decremented by 1, and `strr` is 'y'.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with `arr[l]` and then taking the modulus with `m`. Since `l` is decremented by 1, its new value is `l - 1`. The value of `strr` remains 'y' as it is not affected by the code. The updated value of `p` is stored in `ans`.
