Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `k`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was the next character in `s`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - If `k` was 'L' in the previous iteration, then `l` is incremented by 1.
   - If `k` was not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1.
   - Regardless of the value of `k`, the next character in `s` will be assigned to `k` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `k` is the next character in `s`, `s` itself does not change; it remains the same string.
   - `k` will be the next character in `s`.
   - If `k` was 'L' in the previous iteration, `l` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `k` was not 'L', `r` will be decreased by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `l` and `r` based on the condition of the previous iteration, while `s` and `k` are adjusted accordingly.

**State:**
- `s` is a non-empty string (unchanged).
- `k` is the next character in `s`.
- If `k` was 'L' in the previous iteration, `l` is 1 more than its original value.
- If `k` was not 'L', `r` is decreased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in `s`, if `k` was 'L' in the previous iteration, `l` is 1 more than its original value, if `k` was not 'L', `r` is decreased by 1**.
