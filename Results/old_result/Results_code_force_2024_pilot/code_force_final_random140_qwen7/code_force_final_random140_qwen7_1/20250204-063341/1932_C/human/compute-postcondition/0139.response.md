Output State: **`p` is `p * arr[1] % m`, `strr` is 'R', `r` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with `arr[r]` and then taking the modulus with `m`. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `arr` and `m`, so `p` is updated to `p * arr[1] % m`. The values of `strr` and `r` remain unchanged.
