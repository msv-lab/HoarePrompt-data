Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `strr` in the expression `for strr in s[::-1]:`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is the initial string.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is 1.
   - `p` is 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing 0.
   - `strr` is not equal to 'R'.

4. **Determine the next value of `strr`**: Since the loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, the next value of `strr` will be the next character from the reversed string.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - `p` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `strr` changes to the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.

Given that `strr` is not equal to 'R' at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `strr` will be the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `p` is 0, `ans` is a list containing 0, and `strr` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R')**.
