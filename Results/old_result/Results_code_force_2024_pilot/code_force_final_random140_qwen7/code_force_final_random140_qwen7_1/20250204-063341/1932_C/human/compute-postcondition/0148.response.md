Output State: **`r` is 1, `p` is updated based on the value of `strr` (which is now 'y'), `ans` contains the updated value of `p`, `l` is decremented by 1, `strr` is 'y'**.

This means that the variable `r` has been incremented by 1, making its value 1. The variables `p` and `ans` retain their updated values based on the condition where `strr` is 'y'. Additionally, the variable `l` has been decremented by 1, and `strr` remains 'y'.
