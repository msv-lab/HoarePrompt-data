Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is not equal to 'L'**.

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
