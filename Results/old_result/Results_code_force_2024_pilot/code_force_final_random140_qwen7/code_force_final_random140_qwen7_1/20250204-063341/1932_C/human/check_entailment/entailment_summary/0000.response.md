Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: \( n \), \( m \), the array \( a \), and the string \( s \).
3. The program uses indices \( l \) and \( r \) to keep track of the current positions in the array \( a \) as elements are removed according to the commands in \( s \).
4. When processing the commands from right to left (using `s[::-1]`), it correctly updates the product \( p \) by multiplying with the appropriate element from the array \( a \) and taking the result modulo \( m \).
5. The results are stored in the list \( ans \) and printed in reverse order, which aligns with the requirement to output the remainders in the order they are computed.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
