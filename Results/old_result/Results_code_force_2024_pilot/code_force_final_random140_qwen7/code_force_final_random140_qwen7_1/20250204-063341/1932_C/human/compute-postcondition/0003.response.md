Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
