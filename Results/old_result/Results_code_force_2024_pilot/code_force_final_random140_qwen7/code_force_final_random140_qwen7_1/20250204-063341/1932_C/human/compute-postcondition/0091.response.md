Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is 2, `p` is `arr[2]`, `ans` is a list containing 0, `strr` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R')**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `p * arr[r] % m`. Initially, `p` is 0. Multiplying 0 by any number (in this case, `arr[2]`) still results in 0. Therefore, `p` remains 0 after the operation. All other variables (`l`, `r`, `ans`, and `strr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
