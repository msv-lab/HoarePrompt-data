Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `p` is 0, `ans` is a list containing 0, and `strr` is not equal to 'R'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(p)` appends the value of `p` (which is 0) to the list `ans`. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is an empty list if `strr` is 'R', and in this case `strr` is not 'R', `ans` remains an empty list. However, after executing the code, `ans` becomes a list containing the value 0. All other variables (`s`, `l`, `r`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
