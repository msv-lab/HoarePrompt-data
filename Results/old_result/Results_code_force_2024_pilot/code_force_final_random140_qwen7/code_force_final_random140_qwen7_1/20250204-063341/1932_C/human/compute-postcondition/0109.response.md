Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is either -1 or 0, `r` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `arr`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `l`, `r`, `p`, `ans`, `strr`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
