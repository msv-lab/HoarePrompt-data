Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and converts each to an integer. These values are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged within the given range.
