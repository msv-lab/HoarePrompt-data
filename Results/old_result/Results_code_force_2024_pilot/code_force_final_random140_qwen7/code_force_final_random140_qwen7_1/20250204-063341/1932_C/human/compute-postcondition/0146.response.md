Output State: **`p` is updated based on the value of `strr`; `ans` contains the updated value of `p`; `l` is decremented by 1; `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. The value of `p` is updated based on the value of `strr` as per the given conditions. If `strr` is 'R', `p` is updated to `p * arr[1] % m` and `strr` remains 'R'. If `strr` is not 'R', `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`, `l` is decremented by 1, and `strr` is set to the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
