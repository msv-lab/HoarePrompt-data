Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), a list of \( n \) integers \( a \), and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It then iterates through the string \( s \) from right to left, updating indices \( l \) and \( r \) based on the direction ('L' or 'R') specified by each character. During this process, it calculates a running product \( p \) of specific elements from the list \( a \), taking the result modulo \( m \), and stores each intermediate value of \( p \) in a list \( ans \). Finally, it prints the list \( ans \) in reverse order.**
