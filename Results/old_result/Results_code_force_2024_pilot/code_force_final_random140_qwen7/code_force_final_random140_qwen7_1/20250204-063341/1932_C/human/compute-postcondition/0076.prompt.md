Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is 0, `n` is an integer input decremented by 3, `m` is an integer input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is the final product of the sequence of multiplications defined by the characters in `s` read from right to left, modulo `m`, `arr` is updated to a list of integers obtained from space-separated inputs, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, and the input is decremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for k in s:
    if k == 'L':
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the first character of `s`. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1. If `k` is not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in `s`. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1 more than its original value. If `k` is not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string (unchanged), `k` is the next character in `s`, if `k` is 'L', `l` is 1 more than its original value, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
