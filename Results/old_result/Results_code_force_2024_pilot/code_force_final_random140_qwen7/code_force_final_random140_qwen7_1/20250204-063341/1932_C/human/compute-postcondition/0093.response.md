Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is -1, `r` is 1, `p` is 0, `ans` is a list containing 0, and `arr[l]` is 1 (since `l` is -1 and assuming `arr` is an array where `arr[-1]` is 1), so `p` is 0 after the operation.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. Given that `p` was initially 0, multiplying it by `arr[l]` (which is 1) and then taking modulo `m` (assuming `m` is not specified and thus not affecting the value) results in `p` remaining 0. All other variables (`s`, `l`, `r`, `p`, `ans`, and `strr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
