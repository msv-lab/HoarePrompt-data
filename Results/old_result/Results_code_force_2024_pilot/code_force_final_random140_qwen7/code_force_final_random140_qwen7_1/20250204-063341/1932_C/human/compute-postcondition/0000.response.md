Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`. The variable `_` is not relevant since it is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition. The critical part here is the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` itself can be the input to `int(input())`, and the loop will execute `t` times.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will execute `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is correctly set to a value within the specified range. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
