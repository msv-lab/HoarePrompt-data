Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the indices `l` and `r` based on the commands in the string `s`. Instead of removing elements from the array based on the commands and recalculating the product of the remaining elements, the program simply updates the indices without actually modifying the array. This leads to incorrect results for the remainders of the products.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

The expected output is:

```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program's output is:

```
0 0 0 0
```

This discrepancy arises because the program does not actually remove elements from the array based on the commands. It only updates the indices `l` and `r` which are not used to recalculate the product of the remaining elements. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
