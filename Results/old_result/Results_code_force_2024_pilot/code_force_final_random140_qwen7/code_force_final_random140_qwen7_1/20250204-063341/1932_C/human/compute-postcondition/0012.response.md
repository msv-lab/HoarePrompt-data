Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a non-empty string. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is increased by 1 and becomes 1, `r` remains as `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` stays at 0 and `r` decreases by 1 becoming `n - 2`, and `k` is not equal to 'L'.
