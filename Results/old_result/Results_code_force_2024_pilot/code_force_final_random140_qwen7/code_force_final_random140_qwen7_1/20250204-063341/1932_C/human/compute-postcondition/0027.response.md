Output State: **`s` is not an empty string, `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1**

The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was not specified with an initial value, we can only say that it has been increased by 1. The values of `s` and `strr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
