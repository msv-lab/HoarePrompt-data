To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` contains the product of all `arr` values based on certain loop conditions. Since no specific loop conditions or `arr` values are provided, we need to assume the context from previous examples or typical scenarios. Typically, `ans` would be a list or a sequence of values resulting from such a product calculation.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*ans[::-1])
   ```

   - `ans[::-1]`: This slice notation reverses the list `ans`.
   - `*ans[::-1]`: The `*` operator unpacks the reversed list into separate arguments for the `print` function, effectively printing each element of the reversed list on a new line if it were a multi-element list.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will depend on the actual content of `ans`. Since no specific values are provided for `ans`, we can only describe the general behavior.

Output: **the elements of ans in reverse order, separated by spaces**
