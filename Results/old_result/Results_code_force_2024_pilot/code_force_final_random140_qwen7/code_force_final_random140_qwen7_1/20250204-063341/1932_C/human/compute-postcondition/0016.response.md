Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `l` is 1 if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `r - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `r` is updated based on whether the next character in `s` is 'L' or not, but since the decrement operation is independent of the condition, `r` is simply reduced by 1.
