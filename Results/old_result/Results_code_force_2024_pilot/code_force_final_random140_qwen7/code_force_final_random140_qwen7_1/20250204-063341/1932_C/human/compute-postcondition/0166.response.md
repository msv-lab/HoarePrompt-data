Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers `a` (with 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for each element in the list and the length of the list being n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), an integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), and a string `s` of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.**

This means the function likely processes these inputs according to some internal logic but does not return a value directly from the function signature or the described outputs.
