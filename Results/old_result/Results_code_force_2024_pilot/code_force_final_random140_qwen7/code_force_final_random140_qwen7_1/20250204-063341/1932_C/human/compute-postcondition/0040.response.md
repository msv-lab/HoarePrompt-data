Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to either `p * arr[r] % m` or `p * arr[l] % m`, depending on whether `next_strr` is 'R' or not. `ans` contains the updated value of `p`, `r` is increased by 1, and `l` is decreased by 1 if `next_strr` is not 'R', otherwise `l` remains unchanged.
