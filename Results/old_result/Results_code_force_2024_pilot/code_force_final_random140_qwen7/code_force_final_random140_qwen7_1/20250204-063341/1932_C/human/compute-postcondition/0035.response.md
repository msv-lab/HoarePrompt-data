Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `strr`, which is taken from the reversed string `s[::-1]`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `p` is updated based on the value of `strr`.
   - `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`.
   - `r` is increased by 1 if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `l` is decreased by 1.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - `strr` is taken from the reversed string `s[::-1]`.
   - Depending on the value of `strr`, `p` is updated.
   - `ans` is updated to the new value of `p`.
   - If `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1; otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `strr` is taken from the reversed string, the next value of `strr` will be the next character from the original string `s` (but in reverse order).
   - Therefore, `strr` will be the next character from `s` when read in reverse.
   - `p` will be updated based on this new value of `strr`.
   - `ans` will be updated to the new value of `p`.
   - `r` or `l` will be adjusted based on the value of the new `strr`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `p` will be updated based on the next value of `strr`.
   - `ans` will contain the updated value of `p`.
   - `r` or `l` will be adjusted based on the next value of `strr`.

Given that the next value of `strr` will be the next character from the original string `s` when read in reverse, let's denote the next character as `next_strr`.

**New State**:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `p` will be updated based on the next value of `strr` (let's call it `next_strr`).
- `ans` will contain the updated value of `p`.
- If `next_strr` is 'R', `r` will be increased by 1; otherwise, `l` will be decreased by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` will be updated based on the next value of `strr` (let's call it `next_strr`), `ans` will contain the updated value of `p`, `r` will be increased by 1 if `next_strr` is 'R', otherwise `l` will be decreased by 1**.
