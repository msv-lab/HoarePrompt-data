Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated based on the value of `strr`, `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`, `r` is increased by 1 if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `l` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. The value of `p` is determined by the condition in the postcondition, but since the code does not change the values of `s`, `strr`, `arr`, `r`, `p`, `l`, and `m`, those variables retain their previous states. The only new information is that `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`.
