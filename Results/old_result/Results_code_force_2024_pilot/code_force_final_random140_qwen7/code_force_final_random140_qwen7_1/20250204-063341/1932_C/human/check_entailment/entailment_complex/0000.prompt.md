Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Example

Input

    4 6
    
    3 1 4 2
    
    LRRL
    
    5 1

    1 2 3 4 5 6
    
    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000
    
    R

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in s:
            if k == 'L':
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        
        p = 1
        
        ans = []
        
        for strr in s[::-1]:
            if strr == 'R':
                r += 1
                p = p * arr[r] % m
            else:
                l -= 1
                p = p * arr[l] % m
            ans.append(p)
        
        print(*ans[::-1])
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `s` is the initial string, `l` is either -1 or 0, `r` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the final product of the sequence of multiplications defined by the characters in `s` read from right to left, modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing all the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), a list of \( n \) integers \( a \), and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It then iterates through the string \( s \) from right to left, updating indices \( l \) and \( r \) based on the direction ('L' or 'R') specified by each character. During this process, it calculates a running product \( p \) of specific elements from the list \( a \), taking the result modulo \( m \), and stores each intermediate value of \( p \) in a list \( ans \). Finally, it prints the list \( ans \) in reverse order.
