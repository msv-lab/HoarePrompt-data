Postcondition: `k` is the third character of the string `s`, `s` is an input string, `l` is either `l + 1` or remains as `l` (either 0 or 1), `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the if condition, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces, and `r` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed.
