Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `arr` by taking input as a string, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `m` also remains unchanged. The new list `arr` contains the integers obtained from the input string.
