Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `k` which is taken from the string `s`. Other relevant variables in the loop context are `l` and `r`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - If `k` is 'L', then `l` is increased by 1 (making it 1) and `r` remains `n - 1`.
   - If `k` is not 'L', then `l` remains 0 and `r` becomes `n - 2`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - We need to consider both possible scenarios for the next iteration of the loop.
   - Since we don't know the exact value of `k` for the next iteration, we need to account for both possibilities.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` could either be 1 (if `k` is 'L') or 0 (if `k` is not 'L').
   - `r` could either be `n - 1` (if `k` is 'L') or `n - 2` (if `k` is not 'L').

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r`.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `m` is an integer from the input.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `l` is 1 if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1` if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`.

Therefore, the final state can be represented as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `l` is 1 if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`**.
