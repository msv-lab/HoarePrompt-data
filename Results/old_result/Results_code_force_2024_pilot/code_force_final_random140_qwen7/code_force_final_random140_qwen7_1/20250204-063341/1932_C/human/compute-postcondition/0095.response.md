Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is either 0 or -1, `r` is either 2 or 1, `p` is either `arr[2]` or 0, `ans` is a list containing 0 and `arr[2]` or 0, `strr` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R').**

The code `ans.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. Given that `p` is either `arr[2]` or 0, `ans` will now contain 0 and `arr[2]` or 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
