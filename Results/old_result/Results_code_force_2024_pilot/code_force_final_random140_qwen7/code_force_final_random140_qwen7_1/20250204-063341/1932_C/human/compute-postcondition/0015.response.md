Output State: **`l` is 2 if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1` if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. Initially, `l` was 1 if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` was 0. After incrementing `l` by 1, if the next character in `s` is 'L', `l` becomes 2, otherwise `l` remains 1. The value of `r` remains unchanged as the code only modifies `l`.
