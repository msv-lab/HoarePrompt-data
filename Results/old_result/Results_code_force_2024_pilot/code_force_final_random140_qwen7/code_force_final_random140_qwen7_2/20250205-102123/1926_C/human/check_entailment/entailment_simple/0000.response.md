Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program initializes `soma` to 0 and then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive), calling `func_1(i)` for each value of `i` and adding the result to `soma`. However, the problem requires processing a series of test cases where each test case involves a different value of `n` up to \(2 \times 10^5\). The current implementation only processes the values from 0 to 12, which is not sufficient.

Moreover, the program does not read input from the user or handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. It seems to be hardcoded to process a fixed set of values, which is clearly not what the problem requires.

Given these observations, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
