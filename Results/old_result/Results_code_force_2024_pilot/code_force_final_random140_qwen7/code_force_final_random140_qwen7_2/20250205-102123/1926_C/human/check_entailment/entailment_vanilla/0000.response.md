Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - This is correctly implemented using a generator expression inside the `sum` function to convert each digit of `n` into an integer and sum them up.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main part of the program initializes `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive), calling `func_1(i)` for each value of `i` and adding the result to `soma`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `soma`.

### Problem Description vs. Given Program

- **Problem Description**: 
  - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` and then summing those results.
  - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`.

- **Given Program**:
  - The program only processes the numbers from 0 to 12, not from 1 to `n` as required by the problem.
  - The program does not take any input from the user; it hard-codes the values from 0 to 12 and prints the sum of their digit sums.

### Conclusion

The given program does not match the requirements of the problem. It only processes a fixed set of numbers (0 to 12) instead of processing numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case.

### Correctness

**Correctness: False**

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to read the number of test cases and the value of `n` for each test case, then compute the sum of the digit sums for each number from 1 to `n`.
