Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program seems to be testing a helper function `func_1` which calculates the sum of digits of a number, but it does not actually solve the main problem. The main logic to calculate the sum of the numbers after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits is missing. 

For example, for the input `n=12`, the expected output is `51`, but the program will not produce this result because it is not performing the necessary calculations for the given problem. The program should iterate over all numbers from 1 to `n`, calculate the sum of digits for each number, and then sum these values. However, the current implementation only tests the `func_1` function with numbers from 1 to 12 and prints the sum of these tests, which is irrelevant to the actual problem.
