Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the provided program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`. It works as expected for individual numbers.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The program initializes `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive).
   - For each iteration, it calls `func_1(i)` and adds the result to `soma`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `soma`.

Given the problem description, we need to:
- Iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
- Replace each number with the sum of its digits.
- Sum these new values.

However, the provided program:
- Only iterates through numbers from 1 to 12.
- Calls `func_1` on these numbers and sums their results.
- Does not perform the required operations for numbers greater than 12, nor does it handle the full range up to `n`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only tests the `func_1` function with a limited set of numbers and does not compute the required sum for any arbitrary `n`.

Final: **False**
