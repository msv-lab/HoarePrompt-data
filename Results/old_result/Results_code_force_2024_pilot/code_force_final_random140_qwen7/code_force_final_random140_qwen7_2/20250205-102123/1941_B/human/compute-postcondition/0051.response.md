Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `elementIndex` and the range of its values. The loop iterates from `1` to `length - 1`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
   - `elementIndex` is 99
   - `highestIndex` is 99
   - `highestNumber` is `inputarray[99]`

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `elementIndex` must be within the range `1` to `length - 1`. Since `elementIndex` is currently 99, it is already at the upper limit of the range specified in the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since `elementIndex` is already at the maximum value (99), the loop cannot execute again because it would exceed the range `1` to `length - 1`. Therefore, no changes are needed for `elementIndex`.

5. **Conclusion**: The states of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `highestIndex` is 99, and `highestNumber` is inputarray[99]**.

This means that the loop will start with `elementIndex` set to 1 for the next iteration, while `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged.
