Output State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `length` is at least 2, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[1]`, `highestIndex` is 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Given that `elementIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is now set to `inputarray[1]`. The other variables (`length` and `highestIndex`) remain unchanged.
