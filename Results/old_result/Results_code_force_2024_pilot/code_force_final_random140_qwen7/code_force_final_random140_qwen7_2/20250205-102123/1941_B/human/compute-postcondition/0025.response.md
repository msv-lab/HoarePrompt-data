Output State: `elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 99, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from index 1 to 98 of `inputarray`. `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in that subarray.

This output state is derived from the fact that the loop runs from `elementIndex` starting at 1 up to `length - 1`, which means it will iterate until `elementIndex` reaches `length - 2`. Given that the initial condition was `loop_counter` must be less than 100, the loop will run 99 times (from 1 to 98). During each iteration, the code updates `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` if the current element is greater than the previously recorded `highestNumber`. After 99 iterations, `elementIndex` will be 98, and `highestNumber` will hold the maximum value found in the specified subarray, with `highestIndex` pointing to its position.
