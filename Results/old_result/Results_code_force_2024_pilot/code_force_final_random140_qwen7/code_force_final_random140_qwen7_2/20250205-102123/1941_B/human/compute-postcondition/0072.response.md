Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `elementIndex` is within the range specified by the `range(1, length - 1)`.

3. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `elementIndex` is initially 98.
   - `length` is `len(inputarray)`.
   - `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` are not relevant to the loop head.
   - `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, which is not relevant to the loop head.
   - `loop_counter` is less than 100, but this is not part of the loop head.

4. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - For the loop to start, `elementIndex` must be within the range `1` to `length - 1`.
   - Given that `elementIndex` is currently 98, we need to ensure that `length` is greater than 98.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `elementIndex` should be within the range `1` to `length - 1`.
- `length` must be greater than 98.

So, the final state is:
**`elementIndex` is 98, `length` must be greater than 98, `highestIndex` is -1, `highestNumber` is -1, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is less than 100.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of the objects in the loop head, the final answer is:
**`elementIndex` is 98, `length` must be greater than 98**.
