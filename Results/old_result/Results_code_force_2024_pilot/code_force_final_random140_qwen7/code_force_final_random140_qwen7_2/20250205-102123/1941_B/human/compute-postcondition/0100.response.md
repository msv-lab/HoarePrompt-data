Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is 100, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[100]`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, 100)`, and `loop_counter` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `loop_counter` by 1, but since the initial value of `loop_counter` is not specified, we only know that it has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
