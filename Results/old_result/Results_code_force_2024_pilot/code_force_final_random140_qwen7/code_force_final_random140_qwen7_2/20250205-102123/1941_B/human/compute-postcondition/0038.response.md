Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[98]`, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this subarray, `loop_counter` is less than 100, and `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `length` to the length of `inputarray`, which is 99 since `elementIndex` was 98 and `inputarray` likely starts from index 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
