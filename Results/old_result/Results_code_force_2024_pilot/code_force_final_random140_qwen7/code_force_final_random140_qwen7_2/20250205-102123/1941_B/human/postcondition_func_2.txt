The function accepts a list of integers and processes it without returning any value. It checks if certain conditions are met using `func_2` and `func_1`. If these conditions are satisfied, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list. If not, it finds the highest number in a specific subarray of the input list, creates a new array based on this highest number, and repeats the check. If after 100 iterations, the conditions are still not met, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list.
