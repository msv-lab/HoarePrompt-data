Output State: **`elementIndex` is 2, `length` is at least 2, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[2]`, and `highestIndex` is 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Given that `elementIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[2]`. The other variables (`length`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
