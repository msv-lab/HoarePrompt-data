### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function performs the operation described in the problem statement.
- It takes an array and an index `i`, and modifies the array according to the rules.
- The function returns the modified array.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
- Otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function attempts to solve the main problem.
- It initializes `answers` (which is not defined in the provided code but assumed to be a list where results are stored).
- If the initial array already satisfies the condition (all elements are zero), it appends 'YES' to `answers` and returns.
- If not, it enters a loop where it finds the maximum value in the array and applies `func_1` to reduce that value.
- The loop continues up to 100 iterations.
- If after 100 iterations, the array still does not satisfy the condition, it appends 'NO' to `answers` and returns.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The initial check in `func_3` is correct. If the array is already all zeros, it should return 'YES'.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value**:
   - The logic to find the maximum value in the array is correct. However, the loop counter should be initialized before the loop starts, which is done correctly here.

3. **Applying the Operation**:
   - The operation applied in `func_1` is correct and follows the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the index of the maximum value found, which is also correct.

4. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop runs up to 100 times. This is a reasonable limit to prevent infinite loops, assuming the problem constraints are met.
   - If the array becomes all zeros within these 100 iterations, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array might become all zeros within the allowed iterations.
   - However, it does not handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros due to the nature of the operations (e.g., if the sum of the array is odd).

### Detailed Analysis

- **Sum of Array**: The operations in `func_1` reduce the sum of the array by 3 for each application. Therefore, the sum of the array must be divisible by 3 for the array to be reducible to all zeros.
- **Handling Odd Sums**: If the sum of the array is not divisible by 3, it is impossible to reduce the array to all zeros using the given operations. The program does not check this condition, which is a critical oversight.
- **Loop Limit**: The loop limit of 100 is arbitrary and does not ensure that the program will terminate correctly if the array cannot be reduced. This could lead to incorrect results if the array size is large and the sum is not divisible by 3.

### Conclusion

The program fails to handle the case where the sum of the array is not divisible by 3, which is a crucial requirement for the array to be reducible to all zeros. Additionally, the loop limit of 100 is insufficient to guarantee termination for all possible inputs.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and the loop limit of 100 is insufficient to guarantee termination for all possible inputs.
