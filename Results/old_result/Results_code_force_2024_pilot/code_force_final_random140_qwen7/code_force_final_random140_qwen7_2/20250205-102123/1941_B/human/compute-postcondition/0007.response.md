Output State: **`loop_counter` must be less than 100; `length` is the length of the input array provided by input(); `highestNumber` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `highestNumber` to -1. The values of `loop_counter` and `length` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `loop_counter` must still be less than 100, and `length` retains its original value as the length of the input array.
