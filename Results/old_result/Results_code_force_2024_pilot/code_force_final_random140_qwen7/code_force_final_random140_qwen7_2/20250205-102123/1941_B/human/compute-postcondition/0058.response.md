Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99, `highestIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is less than 0, `answers` list has 'NO' appended to it.**

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `answers`. Since `answers` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be a new list created by this operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
