Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 2, `length` is at least 2, and `highestNumber` remains as `inputarray[2]` since `inputarray[elementIndex]` is compared to `highestNumber` and if the condition is true, `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[2]`. If the condition is false, `highestNumber` remains unchanged.
