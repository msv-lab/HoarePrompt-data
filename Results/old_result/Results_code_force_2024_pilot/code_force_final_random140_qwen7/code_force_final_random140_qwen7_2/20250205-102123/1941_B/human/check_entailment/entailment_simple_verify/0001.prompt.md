You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `loop_counter` will reach 100, which is the condition that breaks the while loop. By the last iteration, `elementIndex` will still be 98 because the loop increments `loop_counter` but does not change `elementIndex`. The `length` of `inputarray` remains 100 as it is not modified within the loop. `highestIndex` will be the last valid index checked, which is 99, and `highestNumber` will be the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`. `newArray` will be the result of the last call to `func_1(inputarray, 99)`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs the operation described in the problem statement.
   - It takes an array and an index `i`, and modifies the array according to the rules.
   - The function returns the modified array.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to solve the main problem.
   - It initializes `answers` (which is not defined in the provided code but assumed to be a list where results are stored).
   - If the initial array already satisfies the condition (all elements are zero), it appends 'YES' to `answers` and returns.
   - If not, it enters a loop where it finds the maximum value in the array and applies `func_1` to reduce that value.
   - The loop continues up to 100 iterations.
   - If after 100 iterations, the array still does not satisfy the condition, it appends 'NO' to `answers` and returns.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The initial check in `func_3` is correct. If the array is already all zeros, it should return 'YES'.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value**:
   - The logic to find the maximum value in the array is correct. However, the loop counter should be initialized before the loop starts, which is done correctly here.

3. **Applying the Operation**:
   - The operation applied in `func_1` is correct and follows the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the index of the maximum value found, which is also correct.

4. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop runs up to 100 times. This is a reasonable limit to prevent infinite loops, assuming the problem constraints are met.
   - If the array becomes all zeros within these 100 iterations, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array might become all zeros within the allowed iterations.
   - However, it does not handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros due to the nature of the operations (e.g., if the sum of the array is odd).

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operations. The only potential issue is that the program assumes the array can always be reduced to all zeros, which may not be true for certain arrays (e.g., if the sum of the array is odd).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for the given examples and problem description.
