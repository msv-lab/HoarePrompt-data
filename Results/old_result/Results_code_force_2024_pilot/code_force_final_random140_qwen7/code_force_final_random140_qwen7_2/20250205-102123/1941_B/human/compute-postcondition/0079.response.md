Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `elementIndex` is 98
   - `length` is greater than 98
   - `highestIndex` is 98
   - `highestNumber` is `inputarray[98]`

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be less than `length - 1`.
   - Currently, `elementIndex` is 98 and `length` is greater than 98, so `elementIndex < length - 1` will be true if `length > 99`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `elementIndex` is currently 98, it will be incremented to 99 for the next iteration.
   - `length` remains the same and must still be greater than 99 for the loop to continue.

6. **No changes to `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` are needed unless the loop body modifies them, but based on the given postcondition, they remain unchanged**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`elementIndex` is 99, `length` must be greater than 99, `highestIndex` is 98, and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[98]`**
