Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98; `highestIndex` is 98; `length` is greater than 98; `highestNumber` is `inputarray[98]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Given that `elementIndex` is 98, `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[98]`. The values of `elementIndex`, `highestIndex`, and `length` remain unchanged from their initial states.
