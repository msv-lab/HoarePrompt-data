### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Description**: We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying the operation defined in `func_1`.

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_1(array, index)`: This function performs the specified operation on the array at the given index.
   - `func_2(arrayForSuccess)`: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - `func_3(inputarray)`: This function processes the input array and uses `func_2` and `func_1` to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros. If so, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list. If not, it finds the highest number in the array, applies the operation, and repeats the check up to 100 times. If after 100 iterations, the array still isn't all zeros, it appends 'NO'.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `func_3` function correctly identifies the highest value in the array and applies the operation to it. This is a reasonable approach because reducing the highest value often brings down other values as well.
   - The function then checks if the array is now all zeros using `func_2`. If not, it repeats the process up to 100 times. This ensures that even if the highest value reduction doesn't immediately solve the problem, it continues to try until either the array is all zeros or 100 attempts are exhausted.
   - The use of a maximum of 100 iterations is a safeguard to prevent infinite loops, which is a good practice given the constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the array might not be reducible to all zeros within 100 iterations by appending 'NO'.
   - The function also correctly identifies when the array is already all zeros initially.

Given the analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. The original assessment was overly critical and did not fully consider the safeguards and logic implemented in `func_3`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct in its implementation and logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations.
