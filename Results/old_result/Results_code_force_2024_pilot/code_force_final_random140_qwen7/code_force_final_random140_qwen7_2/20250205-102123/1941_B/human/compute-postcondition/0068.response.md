The only variable in the loop head is `loop_counter`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop_counter`. If `loop_counter` is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `loop_counter` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `loop_counter` must be less than 100.

The states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99, `highestIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is less than 100**
