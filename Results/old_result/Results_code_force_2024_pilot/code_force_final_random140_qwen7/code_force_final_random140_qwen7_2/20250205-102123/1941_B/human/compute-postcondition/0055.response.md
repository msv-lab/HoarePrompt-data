Postcondition: `elementIndex` is 1, `highestIndex` is 1, and `highestNumber` is inputarray[1]. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `elementIndex`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` are all set to 1. There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition remains unchanged if the if condition is not met.
