Output State: `elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 100, `highestIndex` is 99, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`, `loop_counter` is 100, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, 99)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `loop_counter` reaches 100), the final state of the variables inside the loop will reflect the last iteration's conditions. In the last iteration, `loop_counter` equals 100, so the loop condition `loop_counter != 100` becomes false, and the loop terminates. At this point, `elementIndex` remains 98 because the loop increments `loop_counter` but does not change `elementIndex` in each iteration. The `length` of `inputarray` is 100, `highestIndex` is set to 99 (the last index considered in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`), `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in this subarray, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, 99)`.
