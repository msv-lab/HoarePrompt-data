Output State: **`elementIndex` is 2, `length` is at least 2, `highestNumber` remains as `inputarray[1]`, and `highestIndex` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `highestIndex = elementIndex` assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 2) to `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
