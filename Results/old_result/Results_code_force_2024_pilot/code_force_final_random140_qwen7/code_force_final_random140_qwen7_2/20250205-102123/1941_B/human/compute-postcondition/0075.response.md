Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98; `highestIndex` is 98; `length` is greater than 98; `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 98) to `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `highestIndex` is now 98, while the conditions involving `length` and `inputarray[elementIndex]` remain as they were.
