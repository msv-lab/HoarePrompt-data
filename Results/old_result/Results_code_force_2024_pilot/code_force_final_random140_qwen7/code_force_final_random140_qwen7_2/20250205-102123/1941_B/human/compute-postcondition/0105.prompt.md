You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers, where the length of the list is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and each element a_j (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9).
def func_3(inputarray):
    if func_2(inputarray) :
        answers.append('YES')
        return
        #The program does not return any value
    #State: inputarray is a list of integers, where the length of the list is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and each element a_j (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). The function func_2(inputarray) returns False
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        
        highestNumber = -1
        
        highestIndex = -1
        
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        
        loop_counter += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 100, `highestIndex` is 99, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`, `loop_counter` is 100, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, 99)`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `loop_counter` will reach 100, which is the condition that breaks the while loop. By the last iteration, `elementIndex` will still be 98 because the loop increments `loop_counter` but does not change `elementIndex`. The `length` of `inputarray` remains 100 as it is not modified within the loop. `highestIndex` will be the last valid index checked, which is 99, and `highestNumber` will be the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`. `newArray` will be the result of the last call to `func_1(inputarray, 99)`.
    answers.append('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers and processes the list without returning any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns None

Case_4: The program does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_5: The program returns None

Case_6: The program does not return anything since there is no return statement provided in the code.

Case_7: The program does not return any value since there is no expression or variable being returned in the code snippet.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
