Output State: `elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 100, `highestIndex` is 99, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`, `loop_counter` is 100, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, 99)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `loop_counter` will reach 100, which is the condition that breaks the while loop. By the last iteration, `elementIndex` will still be 98 because the loop increments `loop_counter` but does not change `elementIndex`. The `length` of `inputarray` remains 100 as it is not modified within the loop. `highestIndex` will be the last valid index checked, which is 99, and `highestNumber` will be the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`. `newArray` will be the result of the last call to `func_1(inputarray, 99)`.
