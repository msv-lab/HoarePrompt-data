### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- This function takes an array and an index `i` (where \(2 \le i \le n-1\)).
- It performs the specified operation: subtracts 1 from `a_{i-1}`, 2 from `a_i`, and 1 from `a_{i+1}`.
- The function returns the modified array.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
- It iterates through the array and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
- This function attempts to make all elements of the input array zero.
- It first checks if the array is already zero using `func_2`.
- If not, it enters a loop that runs up to 100 times.
- In each iteration, it finds the highest value in the array (excluding the first and last elements).
- It then applies the operation defined in `func_1` to the highest value.
- It checks again if the array is zero using `func_2`.
- If the array becomes zero, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns.
- If the loop completes without making the array zero, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initial Check**: The program starts by checking if the array is already zero. If so, it immediately outputs 'YES'.
2. **Main Loop**: The main loop runs up to 100 times. Each iteration:
   - Finds the highest value in the middle of the array.
   - Applies the operation to reduce this value.
   - Checks if the array is now zero.
3. **Limitation**: The loop is limited to 100 iterations, which is a fixed upper bound. This means that even if the array can theoretically be reduced to zero, the program might fail to find the solution if it requires more than 100 operations.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the example provided in the original assessment: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`.

1. **Initial Array**: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
2. **Highest Value**: 5 at index 3.
3. **Operation**: `[2, 4, 3, 3, 0]`
4. **New Highest Value**: 4 at index 1.
5. **Operation**: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 0]`
6. **Continue**: The process continues, but it becomes clear that the operations do not lead to all elements being zero.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it may fail to find a sequence of operations that can reduce the array to zero if the required number of operations exceeds 100.
- The fixed limit of 100 iterations is insufficient to guarantee that all arrays can be reduced to zero, especially for larger arrays or those requiring many operations.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero due to the fixed limit of 100 iterations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
