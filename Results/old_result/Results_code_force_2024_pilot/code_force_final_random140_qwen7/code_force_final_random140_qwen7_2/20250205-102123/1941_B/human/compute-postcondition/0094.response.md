Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is 100, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[100]`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, 100)`**.

Explanation: The code creates a new array by calling the function `func_1` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` (which is 100) as arguments. The values of `elementIndex`, `length`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` remain unchanged from their initial state. The `newArray` variable is assigned the result of the function call `func_1(inputarray, 100)`.
