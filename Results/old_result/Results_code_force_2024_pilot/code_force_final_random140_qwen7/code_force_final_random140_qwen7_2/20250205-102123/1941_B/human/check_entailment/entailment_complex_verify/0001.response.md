### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement. It reduces the elements at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
- The function returns the modified array, which is correct.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function correctly checks if all elements in the array are zero. If they are, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
- The function logic is correct.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function is the core logic of the program. Here are the key points:
  1. **Initial Check**: It checks if the array is already all zeros. If so, it appends 'YES' to `answers` and returns.
  2. **Finding the Maximum Value**: It finds the index of the maximum value in the array (excluding the first and last elements).
  3. **Applying the Operation**: It calls `func_1` with the index of the maximum value and checks if the resulting array is all zeros using `func_2`.
  4. **Loop Termination**: The loop runs up to 100 times. If the array becomes all zeros within these iterations, it appends 'YES' to `answers` and returns. If not, it appends 'NO' to `answers` and returns.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle the case where the sum of the array is odd. The operations described in the problem always reduce the sum by 3, so if the initial sum is odd, it will remain odd and cannot be reduced to zero.
- The program assumes that the array can always be reduced to all zeros, which is not necessarily true. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`. The sum is 6, which is even, but the operations will not reduce it to all zeros because the operations do not allow for the exact reduction needed.

#### Correctness Check:
- The initial check in `func_3` is correct.
- Finding the maximum value is correct.
- Applying the operation is correct.
- The loop termination logic is correct, but it does not account for the case where the sum of the array is odd.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the array is odd. Therefore, the program may return incorrect results for some test cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
