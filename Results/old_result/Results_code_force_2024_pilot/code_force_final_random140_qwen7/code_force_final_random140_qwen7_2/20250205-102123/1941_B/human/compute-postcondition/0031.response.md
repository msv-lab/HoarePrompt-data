Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 2, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[98]`, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this subarray, and `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

In this output state, the variables `elementIndex`, `length`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` retain their initial conditions. The new variable `newArray` has been created and assigned the result of the function call `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`.
