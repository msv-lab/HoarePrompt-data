Output State: `elementIndex` is 98 (or the value of `length` minus 2, whichever is smaller), `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is the index of the largest element in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length-2`, and `highestNumber` is the largest element found in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length-2`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `elementIndex` will be 98 (or the second-to-last index of `inputarray` if `inputarray` has more than two elements), `length` will be the length of `inputarray`, `highestIndex` will be the index of the largest element within the first to second-to-last elements of `inputarray`, and `highestNumber` will be the largest value among those elements.
