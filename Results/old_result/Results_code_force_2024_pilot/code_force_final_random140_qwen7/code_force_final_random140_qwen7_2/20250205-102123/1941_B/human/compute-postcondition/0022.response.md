Output State: **`elementIndex` is 3, `highestIndex` is 3, `length` is at least 2, and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[3]`**.

The code updates `highestNumber` to the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. Given that `elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` is now `inputarray[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
