Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement. It reduces the specified indices in the array by the required amounts and returns the modified array. This function is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It iterates through the array and returns `False` as soon as it encounters a non-zero element. If it successfully iterates through the entire array without finding a non-zero element, it returns `True`. This function is correct.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is designed to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. It first checks if the array is already zero using `func_2`. If not, it enters a loop where it repeatedly applies `func_1` to the highest value in the array (excluding the first and last elements) up to 100 times. If after 100 attempts, the array is not zero, it concludes that it is not possible to make all elements zero. This logic seems to follow the problem's requirements.

Given the problem constraints and the descriptions of the functions, the overall approach in `func_3` should work under the assumption that the array can be manipulated in a way that allows it to become all zeros if possible. The logic in `func_3` is consistent with the problem statement and the behavior of the other functions.

Correctness: **True**
