Output State: `elementIndex` is 98 (since it starts from 1 and goes up to `length-1`, but does not exceed `length`), `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is 100, and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[100]`.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, `elementIndex` will still be 98 because the loop increments `elementIndex` starting from 1 up to `length-1`, but stops before reaching `length`. The `length` variable will be greater than 100 since the loop has executed at least 3 times. `highestIndex` will be 100, which is the index of the highest number found in the array during the loop's execution. `highestNumber` will be the value of `inputarray[100]`, as it was the highest number found in the array by the end of the loop.
