Postcondition: **`elementIndex` is 100, `length` must be greater than 100, `highestIndex` is 100, and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[100]`.** 

This means that if the element at `inputarray[elementIndex]` (which is `inputarray[100]`) is greater than or equal to `highestNumber` (which is `inputarray[99]` initially), then `highestIndex` is updated to `elementIndex` (100) and `highestNumber` is updated to the value at `inputarray[100]`. Since there is no else part, the values of `length` and `elementIndex` remain unchanged.
