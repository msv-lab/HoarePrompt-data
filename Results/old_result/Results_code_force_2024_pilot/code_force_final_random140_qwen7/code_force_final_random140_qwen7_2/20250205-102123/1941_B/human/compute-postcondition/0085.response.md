Output State: **`elementIndex` is 100, `length` must be greater than 100, `highestIndex` is 100, and `highestNumber` is `inputarray[99]`**

The code `highestIndex = elementIndex` assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 100) to `highestIndex`. The other variables (`length`, `highestNumber`) remain unchanged.
