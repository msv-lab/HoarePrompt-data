Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `elementIndex` is initially 98.
   - `length` is initially 99.

3. **Understand the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `length - 1`, which means it will iterate over values from `1` to `98` (since `length - 1` is `98`).

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `elementIndex` must be within the range `[1, 98]`.
   - Given that `elementIndex` is initially `98`, it is already within the valid range for the loop to start executing.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `elementIndex` is already set to `98`, it satisfies the condition `1 <= elementIndex < length`.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `elementIndex`.
   - `length` remains `99` and does not need adjustment as it is used to define the upper bound of the range.

6. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - `highestIndex` is `-1` and is not part of the loop head, so it does not need adjustment.
   - `loop_counter` is less than `100` and is not part of the loop head, so it does not need adjustment.
   - `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` and is not part of the loop head, so it does not need adjustment.

Based on this analysis, the only variables that need to be considered are `elementIndex` and `length`, and since they are already in the correct state, no adjustments are necessary.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99**
