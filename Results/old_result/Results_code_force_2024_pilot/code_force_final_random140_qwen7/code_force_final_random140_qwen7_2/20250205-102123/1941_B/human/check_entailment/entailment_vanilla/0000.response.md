Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs the operation described in the problem statement.
   - It takes an array and an index `i`, and modifies the array according to the rules.
   - The function returns the modified array.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to solve the main problem.
   - It initializes `answers` (which is not defined in the provided code but assumed to be a list where results are stored).
   - If the initial array already satisfies the condition (all elements are zero), it appends 'YES' to `answers` and returns.
   - If not, it enters a loop where it finds the maximum value in the array and applies `func_1` to reduce that value.
   - The loop continues up to 100 iterations.
   - If after 100 iterations, the array still does not satisfy the condition, it appends 'NO' to `answers` and returns.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The initial check in `func_3` is correct. If the array is already all zeros, it should return 'YES'.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value**:
   - The logic to find the maximum value in the array is correct. However, the loop counter should be initialized before the loop starts, which is done correctly here.

3. **Applying the Operation**:
   - The operation applied in `func_1` is correct and follows the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the index of the maximum value found, which is also correct.

4. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop runs up to 100 times. This is a reasonable limit to prevent infinite loops, assuming the problem constraints are met.
   - If the array becomes all zeros within these 100 iterations, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array might become all zeros within the allowed iterations.
   - However, it does not handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros due to the nature of the operations (e.g., if the sum of the array is odd).

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operations. The only potential issue is that the program assumes the array can always be reduced to all zeros, which may not be true for certain arrays (e.g., if the sum of the array is odd).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for the given examples and problem description.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
