Output State: **`elementIndex` is 99, `length` must be greater than 99, `highestIndex` is 99, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[99]`, and `highestNumber` is now `inputarray[99]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 99, `highestNumber` is updated to be `inputarray[99]`. The other variables (`elementIndex`, `length`, and `highestIndex`) remain unchanged.
