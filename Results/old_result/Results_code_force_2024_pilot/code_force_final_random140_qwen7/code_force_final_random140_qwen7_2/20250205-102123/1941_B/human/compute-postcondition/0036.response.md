Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 2, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[98]`, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this subarray, `loop_counter` is increased by 1, and `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

Explanation: The line `loop_counter += 1` increments the value of `loop_counter` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
