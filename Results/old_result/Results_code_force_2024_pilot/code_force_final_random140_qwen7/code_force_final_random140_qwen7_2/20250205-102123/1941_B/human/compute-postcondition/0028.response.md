Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is at least 2, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[98]` and is less than 0, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this subarray, `answers` list now contains 'NO'**.

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the `answers` list. The values of `elementIndex`, `length`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.
