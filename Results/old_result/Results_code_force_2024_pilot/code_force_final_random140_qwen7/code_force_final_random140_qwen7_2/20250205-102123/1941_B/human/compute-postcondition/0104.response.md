The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `inputarray`. `inputarray` is a list of integers, where the length of the list is between 3 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and each element `a_j` is between 0 and \(10^9\). Since there is no return statement in the provided code, the function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of integers and process the list without returning any value.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and processes the list without returning any value.**
