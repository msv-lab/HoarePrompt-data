Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Here are the key problems:

1. **Global Variable `answers`**: The variable `answers` is used to store the results but is not defined in the provided code. This would result in a NameError when running the function.

2. **Loop Termination Condition**: The loop in `func_3` runs up to 100 iterations regardless of whether a solution is found. While this might work for some cases, it is not a reliable termination condition. The algorithm should terminate once a solution is found or if it becomes clear that no solution exists.

3. **Operation Application**: The operation is applied to the highest value in the array, which may not always lead to a solution. The operation should be applied in such a way that it helps reduce the array towards zeros.

4. **Edge Cases**: The current implementation does not handle edge cases well, such as arrays where the sum of elements is odd, which cannot be reduced to all zeros.

To address these issues, you could modify the approach to ensure that the operations are applied in a way that guarantees progress towards the goal of making all elements zero. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] -= 1
    array[index] -= 2
    array[index + 1] -= 1
    return array

def func_2(arrayForSuccess):
    return all(x == 0 for x in arrayForSuccess)

def func_3(inputarray):
    if func_2(inputarray):
        return 'YES'
    
    total_sum = sum(inputarray)
    if total_sum % 3 != 0:
        return 'NO'  # If the sum is not divisible by 3, it's impossible to make all elements zero
    
    loop_counter = 0
    while loop_counter < len(inputarray) - 1:
        highestNumber = max(inputarray[1:-1])
        highestIndex = inputarray.index(highestNumber)
        
        if highestNumber < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        if func_2(newArray):
            return 'YES'
        
        loop_counter += 1
    
    return 'NO'

# Example usage:
t = int(input().strip())
answers = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    inputarray = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    answer = func_3(inputarray)
    answers.append(answer)

for ans in answers:
    print(ans)
```

This revised solution checks if the sum of the array elements is divisible by 3 (since each operation reduces the sum by 3). It then iteratively applies the operation to the highest value in the array until either all elements are zero or it determines that it's impossible.
