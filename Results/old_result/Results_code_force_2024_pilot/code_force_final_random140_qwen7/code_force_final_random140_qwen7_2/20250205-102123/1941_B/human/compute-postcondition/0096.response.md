Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is greater than 100, `highestIndex` is 100, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[100]`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, 100)`, `answers` contains 'YES'**

The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `answers`. Since `answers` was not mentioned to contain any elements before, appending `'YES'` to it means that `answers` now contains `'YES'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
