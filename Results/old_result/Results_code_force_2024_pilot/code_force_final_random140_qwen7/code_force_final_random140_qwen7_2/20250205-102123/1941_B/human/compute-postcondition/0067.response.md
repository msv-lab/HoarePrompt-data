Output State: **`elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 99, `highestIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `loop_counter` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
