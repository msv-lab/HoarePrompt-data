Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n, index is an integer such that 2 <= index <= n - 1, and the elements of the array are non-negative integers.
def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2
    array[index + 1] = array[index + 1] - 1
    return array
    #The program returns a list of integers where each element is the same as the original element minus 3, except for the element at position index which remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `array` and an integer `index`. It returns a new list where each element is reduced by 3, except for the element at position `index`, which remains unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arrayForSuccess is a list of integers representing the current state of Rudolf's array after performing the operations.
def func_2(arrayForSuccess):
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: `arrayForSuccess` is a list of integers where all elements are zero.
    #
    #This is because the loop continues to execute as long as there is at least one non-zero element in `arrayForSuccess`. Once the loop has executed three times and the second element is confirmed to be zero, it means all elements in the list must be zero for the loop to continue without returning False. Since the loop does not modify the list but only checks its elements, and it keeps running until it finds a non-zero element which never happens, all elements must be zero by the end of the loop.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arrayForSuccess` and returns `True` if all elements in the list are zero. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers, where the length of the list is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and each element a_j (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9).

    #State: inputarray is a list of integers, where the length of the list is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and each element a_j (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). The function func_2(inputarray) returns False

    #State: Output State: `elementIndex` is 98, `length` is 100, `highestIndex` is 99, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`, `loop_counter` is 100, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, 99)`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `loop_counter` will reach 100, which is the condition that breaks the while loop. By the last iteration, `elementIndex` will still be 98 because the loop increments `loop_counter` but does not change `elementIndex`. The `length` of `inputarray` remains 100 as it is not modified within the loop. `highestIndex` will be the last valid index checked, which is 99, and `highestNumber` will be the maximum value found in the subarray from `inputarray[1]` to `inputarray[99]`. `newArray` will be the result of the last call to `func_1(inputarray, 99)`.
    answers.append('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and processes it without returning any value. It checks if certain conditions are met using `func_2` and `func_1`. If these conditions are satisfied, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list. If not, it finds the highest number in a specific subarray of the input list, creates a new array based on this highest number, and repeats the check. If after 100 iterations, the conditions are still not met, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list.
