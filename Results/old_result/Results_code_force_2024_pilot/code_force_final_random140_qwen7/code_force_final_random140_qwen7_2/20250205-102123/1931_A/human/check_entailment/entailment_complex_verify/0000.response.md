### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly handles all possible cases for generating the lexicographically smallest word for any given encoded value \( n \).

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to \( n \).
- The word consists of lowercase Latin letters, and their positions in the alphabet range from 1 to 26.
- The encoded value \( n \) is the sum of these positions.

#### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve this problem using a series of conditional statements to set the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). However, the logic in the program is flawed and incomplete.

1. **Case 1: \( n // 26 == 0 \)**
   - This case handles the scenario where the encoded value is less than 26.
   - It sets \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) to the same character, which is correct for some values but not for others.
   - For example, if \( n = 3 \), it correctly sets \( a = 'a' \), \( b = 'a' \), and \( c = 'a' \) resulting in "aaa".

2. **Case 2: \( n // 26 == 1 \)**
   - This case handles the scenario where the encoded value is between 27 and 52.
   - It sets \( a \) to 'a', \( b \) to a character determined by \( n - 27 \), and \( c \) to 'z'.
   - For example, if \( n = 30 \), it sets \( a = 'a' \), \( b = 'd' \), and \( c = 'z' \) resulting in "adz".

3. **Case 3: \( n // 26 == 2 \)**
   - This case handles the scenario where the encoded value is between 53 and 78.
   - It sets \( a \) to a character determined by \( n - 52 \), \( b \) and \( c \) to 'z'.
   - For example, if \( n = 60 \), it sets \( a = 'r' \), \( b = 'z' \), and \( c = 'z' \) resulting in "rz".

However, the program does not handle the general case where the sum of the positions can be distributed among \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) in multiple ways. For example, for \( n = 24 \):

- The program correctly sets \( a = 'a' \), \( b = 'a' \), and \( c = 'u' \) resulting in "aua".
- But the lexicographically smallest word should be "ava" since "aav" is not the smallest.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is not used in the main program and is not relevant to the problem's solution.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all possible cases for generating the lexicographically smallest word. It fails to consider all valid combinations of three letters that sum up to the given encoded value \( n \). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
