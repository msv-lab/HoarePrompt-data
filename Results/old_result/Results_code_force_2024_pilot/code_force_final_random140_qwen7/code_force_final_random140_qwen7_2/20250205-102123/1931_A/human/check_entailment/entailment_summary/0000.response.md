Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value `n` into a three-letter word.
   - It uses the variable `n // 26` to determine the first letter (`a`), the second letter (`b`), and the third letter (`c`).
   - However, the logic used in the program is flawed:
     - For `n // 26 == 0`, it sets `a` and `b` to `'a'` and `c` to the character corresponding to `n - 2`.
     - For `n // 26 == 1`, it sets `a` to `'a'`, `b` to the character corresponding to `n - 27`, and `c` to `'z'`.
     - For `n // 26 == 2`, it sets `a` to the character corresponding to `n - 52`, and both `b` and `c` to `'z'`.

3. **Character Calculation**:
   - The character calculation using `chr(96 + (n - 2))` is incorrect for `n // 26 == 0` because it should be `chr(97 + (n - 1))` to get the correct character.
   - Similarly, the other conditions do not correctly handle the decoding logic.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic of the program and does not contribute to the correct decoding process.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
