You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

    24

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   
2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `n` back into a three-letter word.
   - It uses the formula `n // 26` to determine the position of the first letter.
   - However, the logic for determining the letters `a`, `b`, and `c` is flawed.

3. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the first letter can only be 'a' (position 1) and tries to fit the remaining sum into the second and third letters.
   - This approach does not account for all possible combinations and does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 24`, the correct answer should be "aba" (1 + 1 + 22), but the program outputs "aav".
   - For `n = 70`, the correct answer should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26), but the program outputs "rzz".
   - For `n = 3`, the correct answer should be "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1), but the program outputs "aaa".
   - For `n = 55`, the correct answer should be "czz" (3 + 26 + 26), but the program outputs "czz".
   - For `n = 48`, the correct answer should be "auz" (1 + 21 + 26), but the program outputs "auz".

### Correct Approach

To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to:
1. Determine the position of the first letter.
2. Distribute the remaining sum among the second and third letters while ensuring the smallest possible values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = ''
    b = ''
    c = ''
    
    # Determine the position of the first letter
    if n >= 52:
        a = chr(96 + (n - 52))
        n -= 52
    elif n >= 26:
        a = chr(96 + 1)
        n -= 26
    else:
        a = chr(96 + 1)
        n -= 1
    
    # Determine the position of the second and third letters
    if n > 0:
        b = chr(96 + 1)
        c = chr(96 + n)
    else:
        b = chr(96 + 1)
        c = chr(96 + 1)
    
    print(a + b + c)
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases and does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the given program is:
