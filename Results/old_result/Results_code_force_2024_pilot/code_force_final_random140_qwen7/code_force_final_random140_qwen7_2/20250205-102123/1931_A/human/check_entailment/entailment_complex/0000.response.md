Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the given integer `n` into a three-letter word.
   - It checks the value of `n // 26` to determine the possible range of values for the letters.
     - If `n // 26 == 0`, it means the sum of the positions is less than or equal to 26. In this case, the first two letters are 'a' and the third letter is determined by `n - 2`.
     - If `n // 26 == 1`, it means the sum of the positions is between 27 and 52. Here, the first letter is 'a', the second letter is determined by `n - 27`, and the third letter is 'z'.
     - If `n // 26 == 2`, it means the sum of the positions is between 53 and 78. Here, the first letter is determined by `n - 52`, and the other two letters are both 'z'.

3. **Character Conversion**:
   - The program uses `chr(96 + 1)` to represent 'a'.
   - For the third letter, it uses `chr(96 + (n - 2))`, `chr(96 + (n - 27))`, and `chr(96 + (n - 52))` respectively, which correctly converts the numerical values back to their corresponding characters.

4. **Output**:
   - The program constructs the word by concatenating the characters and prints it.

Given the logic and the way the program handles the different ranges of `n`, it correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct in its logic and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
