Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs in reverse from `f - 1` to `0`. The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `a[2 * (i + 1) + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop continues.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs in reverse, `i` will decrease by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i - 1` in the next iteration.
   - We need to ensure that `a[2 * (i - 1) + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
   - Additionally, if `a[2 * (i - 1)]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop will continue.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i - 1`.
- `a[2 * (i - 1) + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
- If `a[2 * (i - 1)]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop will continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i - 1`, `a[2 * (i - 1) + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `x`, and if `a[2 * (i - 1)]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop will continue.**
