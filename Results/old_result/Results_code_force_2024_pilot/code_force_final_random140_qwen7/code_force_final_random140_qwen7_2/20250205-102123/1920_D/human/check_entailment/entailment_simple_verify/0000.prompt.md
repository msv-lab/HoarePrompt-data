You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers representing the results of Jayden's operations on the array a, and q is an integer representing the number of queries. Each element in x corresponds to either appending an integer or appending multiple copies of the current array.
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns an integer from list `b` at index `x`
    #State: `x` is an integer, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `x` is not in `b`
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is an integer between 1 and 1, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `x` is not in `b`, and `a` is an empty iterable. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `x` will be 1 because it is reduced by 1 in each iteration modulo the current value of `i` in `a`. Since `a` contains at least one element initially, after all elements in `a` are processed, `i` becomes 1, making `x` cycle back to 1. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function will return None.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for handling the operations described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the appending of the array multiple times as specified in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The program uses `a[-1]` to track the current size of the array, but it does not correctly append the array multiple times as required. Instead, it tries to update `a[-1]` directly, which is not sufficient for handling the second type of operation (appending `x` copies of the array).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Query Resolution**: The function `resolve_query` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Even if it were defined, the logic for resolving queries based on the current state of the array `a` is not implemented correctly. The program does not maintain the correct structure of the array after each operation, making it impossible to accurately resolve queries.

3. **Potential Case Not Handled**: Consider the following sequence of operations:
   - Append 1 (a = [1])
   - Append 1 copy of the array (a = [1])
   - Append 3 (a = [1, 3])
   - Append 3 copies of the array (a = [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3])

   For a query asking for the 1st element, the program should return 1. However, due to the incorrect handling of operations, the program might return an incorrect value.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle the operations as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
