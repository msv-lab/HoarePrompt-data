Postcondition: `i` is `i - 1`, `a[2 * (i - 1) + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `x`, and if `a[2 * (i - 1)]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop will continue. If `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the condition remains unchanged. If `a[2 * i]` is less than `x`, the condition still holds as the else part does not change the state.
