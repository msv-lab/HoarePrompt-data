Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer representing the length of the original list of tuples. It processes this value through a series of modulo operations based on the operations stored in the list `x`. Depending on the results of these operations, it either returns a value directly from the list `b` at a specific index or the final non-zero remainder obtained after the modulo operations. If the loop completes without returning early, it returns `b[x]` where `x` is the final non-zero remainder.**
