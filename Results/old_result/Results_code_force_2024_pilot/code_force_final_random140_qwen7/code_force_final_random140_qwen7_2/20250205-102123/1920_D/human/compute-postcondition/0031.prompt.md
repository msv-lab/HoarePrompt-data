You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The first integer indicates the type of operation (1 or 2), and the second integer indicates the value or the number of copies involved in the operation. Additionally, the size of the array after performing all operations is at most \(10^{18}\), and the queries are integers \(k_i\) such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c)\), where \(c\) is the size of the array after all operations.
```
def func_1(x):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns a value from the list 'b' at index 'x', where 'x' is an integer representing the length of the original list of tuples and 'b' is a list.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `b` at index `a[2 * i + 1]`, where `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than 0 (since `x` is 0).

Case_3: Output State: The program returns the value of `b[x]` where `x` is the final non-zero remainder obtained after repeatedly applying the modulo operation as specified within the loop. This happens when the loop fully iterates through its range and no further conditions cause an early return.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `x` will hold the smallest non-zero remainder obtained from the series of modulo operations defined inside the loop. If at any point `x` becomes zero before the loop ends, the corresponding value from the `b` array is returned immediately. Otherwise, once the loop finishes, the final non-zero `x` is used to return `b[x]`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
