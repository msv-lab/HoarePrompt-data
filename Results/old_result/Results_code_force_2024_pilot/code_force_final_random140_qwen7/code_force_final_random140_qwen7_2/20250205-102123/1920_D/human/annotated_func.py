#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers representing the results of Jayden's operations on the array a, and q is an integer representing the number of queries. Each element in x corresponds to either appending an integer or appending multiple copies of the current array.
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns an integer from list `b` at index `x`
    #State: `x` is an integer, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `x` is not in `b`
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is an integer between 1 and 1, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `x` is not in `b`, and `a` is an empty iterable. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `x` will be 1 because it is reduced by 1 in each iteration modulo the current value of `i` in `a`. Since `a` contains at least one element initially, after all elements in `a` are processed, `i` becomes 1, making `x` cycle back to 1. If `x` is not found in `b`, the function will return None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns an integer from list `b` at a specific index. If `x` is directly found in list `b`, it returns the corresponding element. Otherwise, it calculates a new value for `x` using `(x - 1) % i + 1` where `i` is the next element in the iterable `a`. It continues this process until `x` is found in list `b` or `a` is exhausted. If no valid index is found, it returns `None`.
