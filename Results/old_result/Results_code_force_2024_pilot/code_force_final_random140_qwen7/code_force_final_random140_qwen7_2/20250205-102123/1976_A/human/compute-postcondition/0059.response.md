Output State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is not an empty string, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the next character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged, `digits` contains the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit and `digits` is updated by adding the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.**

In this case, the code `digits += ch` updates the `digits` variable by appending the next character `ch` to it only if `ch` is a digit. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
