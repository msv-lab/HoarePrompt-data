Output State: **`results` is now ['NO'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is an empty string, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, `digits` contains all numeric characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, the current value of `letters` is not sorted alphabetically, the current value of `digits` is not sorted numerically**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables when `continue` is executed, all the variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.
