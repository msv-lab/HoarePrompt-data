Output State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the next password in the sequence, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` contains all numeric characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared.**

The code `letters = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `letters`. This operation does not affect the values of `results`, `n`, `password`, or `digits`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged, except for `letters`, which is now an empty string.
