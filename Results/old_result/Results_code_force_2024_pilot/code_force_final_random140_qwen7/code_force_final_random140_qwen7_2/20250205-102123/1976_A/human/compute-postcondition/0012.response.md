Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` must have at least one character, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is the first character of `password`, and `ch` is the first character of `password`.**

The code `digits += ch` appends the character `ch` (which is the first character of `password`) to the `digits` string. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
