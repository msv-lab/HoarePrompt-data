Output State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains the string 'NO', 'YES' is appended to `results`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the original `password`, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the original `password`, and either `letters` are not sorted or the digits in `digits` are not sorted or the last letter in `letters` appears after the first digit in `digits` in the `password`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `results` now includes `'YES'` in addition to possibly already existing elements (if it was not initially empty). All other conditions and values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
