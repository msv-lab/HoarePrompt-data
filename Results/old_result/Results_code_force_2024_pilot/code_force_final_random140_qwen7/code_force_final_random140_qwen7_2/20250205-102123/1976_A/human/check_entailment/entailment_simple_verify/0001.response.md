### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes the number of test cases (`t`) and a list of tuples containing the length of the password and the password itself.
   - It initializes two empty strings, `letters` and `digits`, to store the letters and digits from the password.
   - It iterates through each character in the password, appending letters to `letters` and digits to `digits`.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If they are not, it appends 'NO' to the results list and moves to the next test case.
   - This part is correct as it ensures that both letters and digits are sorted.

3. **Checking Digits After Letters**:
   - The condition `if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0]):` is intended to check if there is a digit that comes after a letter.
   - However, this condition is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where the password starts with a digit and ends with a letter. In such cases, the index of the last letter would be greater than the index of the first digit, leading to a false negative.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - Consider the password "123a". According to the problem statement, this password should be considered strong because:
     - All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order ("a").
     - All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order ("123").
     - There are no digits after letters.
   - However, the current implementation would incorrectly mark this password as "NO" because the last letter "a" has a higher index than the first digit "1".

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the password does not contain any digit that comes after a letter. A better approach would be to use a flag to track if a letter has been encountered before a digit.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        digits = ''
        seen_letter = False
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
                seen_letter = True
            elif ch.isdigit():
                if seen_letter:
                    results.append('NO')
                    break
                digits += ch
        
        if not seen_letter:
            results.append('NO')
        elif list(letters) == sorted(letters) and list(digits) == sorted(digits):
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate due to the flaw in the logic for checking if there is a digit that comes after a letter. The corrected code ensures that the password is checked properly according to the problem statement.

Final: **False**
