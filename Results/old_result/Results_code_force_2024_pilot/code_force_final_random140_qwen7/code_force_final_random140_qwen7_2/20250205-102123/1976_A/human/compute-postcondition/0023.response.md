Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` must have at least one character (one less than before), `letters` is the string containing the first character of `password` plus the character `ch`, and `digits` is updated by adding `ch` to it if `ch` is a digit; `letters` is the string obtained by appending `ch` to `letters`.**

In this output state, the `letters` variable has been updated by appending the character `ch` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
