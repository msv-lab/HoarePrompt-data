Output State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is an empty string, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, `digits` contains all numeric characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `password` will be an empty string because every character from the original `password` has been processed. The variable `letters` will contain all alphabetic characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, as each alphabetic character was added to `letters`. Similarly, the variable `digits` will contain all numeric characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, as each numeric character was added to `digits`. The other variables (`results` and `n`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
