Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and each password, storing them appropriately.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It processes each password to separate letters and digits.
   - It checks if both letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that if there are both letters and digits, the last letter does not come before the first digit in the password.
3. **Output**: Based on the checks, it appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list, which is then printed out.

The logic in the function `func_1` accurately follows the problem statement and handles all the required conditions correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
