Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over each character `ch` in the string `password`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ch`, which is the current character being processed, and `password`, which is the string being iterated over.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `ch`: At the end of the previous iteration, `ch` was the last character processed from `password`.
   - `password`: The string `password` remains unchanged as it is the input to the loop.
   - `results`: The value of `results` does not change within the loop unless the loop body modifies it, but since no modifications are mentioned, `results` remains the same.
   - `n`: This variable is not mentioned in the loop head, so its value does not change based on the loop itself.
   - `letters`: This is built up by concatenating alphabetic characters. Since the loop continues until all characters in `password` are processed, `letters` will include the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic.
   - `digits`: Similarly, this is built up by concatenating digit characters. If the current character `ch` is a digit, it will be added to `digits`.

Given these points, at the start of the next iteration, `ch` will be the next character in `password`, `results` will remain the same, `n` will remain the same, `letters` will include the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic, and `digits` will include the current character `ch` if it is a digit.

Since `password` is the input and does not change, and `results` remains the same unless modified inside the loop, the only relevant changes are to `ch`, `letters`, and `digits`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES']
- `n` is the next value in the sequence
- `password` is the same as before
- `ch` is the next character in `password`
- `letters` includes the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic
- `digits` includes the current character `ch` if it is a digit

State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the next character in `password`, `letters` includes the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic, `digits` includes the current character `ch` if it is a digit**
