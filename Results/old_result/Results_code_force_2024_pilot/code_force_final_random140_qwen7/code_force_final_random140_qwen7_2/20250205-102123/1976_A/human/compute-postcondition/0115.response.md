Postcondition: `results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the next character in `password`, `letters` includes the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic, and `digits` includes the current character `ch` if it is a digit. If `ch` is alphabetic, `letters` is updated to include `ch`; if `ch` is a digit, `digits` is updated to include `ch`.
