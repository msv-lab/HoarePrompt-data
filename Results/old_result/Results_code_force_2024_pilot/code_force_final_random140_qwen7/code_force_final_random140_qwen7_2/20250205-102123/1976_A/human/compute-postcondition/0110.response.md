Output State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the next character in `password`, `letters` includes the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic, and `letters` is updated to include the current character `ch`.**

The code `letters += ch` appends the current character `ch` to the list `letters`. Since `ch` is already considered for inclusion in `letters` based on its type (alphabetic or digit), appending it does not change the condition for inclusion. The other variables (`results`, `n`, `password`) remain unchanged.
