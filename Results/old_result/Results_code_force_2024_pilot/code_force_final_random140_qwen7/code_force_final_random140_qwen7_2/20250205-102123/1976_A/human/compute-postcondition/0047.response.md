Output State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is not an empty string, `ch` is the first character of `password` and it is alphabetic, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the first character `ch`, `digits` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code `letters += ch` appends the first character `ch` (which is guaranteed to be alphabetic) to the string `letters`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
