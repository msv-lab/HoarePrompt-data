Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` must have at least one element.
   - `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`.
   - `password` must have at least one character (one less than before).

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for ch in password:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `ch` in `password`.
   - Depending on whether `ch` is an alphabetic character or a digit, either `letters` or `digits` is updated.

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - `password`: Since the loop iterates over each character in `password`, the length of `password` decreases by one with each iteration.
   - `letters` and `digits`: These variables are updated based on the current character `ch`.

5. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `password`.

6. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `password` will have one less character than before.
   - `letters` and `digits` will be updated based on the current character `ch`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `results` remains an empty list since it is not affected by the loop.
- `t` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
- `test_cases` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
- `n` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
- `password` will have one less character than before.
- `letters` and `digits` will be updated based on the current character `ch`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` must have at least one character (one less than before), `letters` is the string containing the first character of `password` plus the character `ch`, and `digits` is updated by adding `ch` to it if `ch` is a digit.**
