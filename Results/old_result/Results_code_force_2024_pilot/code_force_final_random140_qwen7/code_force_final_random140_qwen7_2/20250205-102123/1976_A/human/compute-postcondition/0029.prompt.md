Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` must have at least one character, `letters` is the string containing the first character of `password`, and `digits` is either the first character of `password` if it is a digit, or remains an empty string if it is a letter.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` must have at least one character (one less than before). If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is the string containing the first character of `password` plus the character `ch`, and `digits` remains unchanged. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is updated by adding `ch` to it, and `letters` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` has at least one character (one less than before), `letters` is the string containing the first character of `password` plus the character `ch`, and `digits` is updated by adding `ch` to it if `ch` is a digit.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
