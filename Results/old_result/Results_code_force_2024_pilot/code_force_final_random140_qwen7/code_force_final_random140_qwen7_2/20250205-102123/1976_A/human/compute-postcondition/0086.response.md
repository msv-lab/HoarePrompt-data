Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(n, password)` in the `test_cases` list. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `n` and `password`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more test cases in `test_cases`. Each iteration processes one pair `(n, password)`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each pair in `test_cases`, the next pair `(n, password)` will be the one after the current one.
   - The postcondition given does not directly affect the values of `n` and `password` within the loop itself; it is a condition evaluated after processing each pair.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `n` will be the next value in the sequence from `test_cases`.
   - `password` will be the next password in the sequence from `test_cases`.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be the next pair `(n, password)` from `test_cases`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the next password in the sequence, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, `digits` contains all numeric characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared.**
