Output State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is added to `letters`, `digits` remains unchanged.**

The code `letters += ch` appends the current character `ch` to the list `letters`. Since `ch` is the next character in the password, it is added to `letters`. The other variables (`results`, `n`, `password`, and `digits`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
