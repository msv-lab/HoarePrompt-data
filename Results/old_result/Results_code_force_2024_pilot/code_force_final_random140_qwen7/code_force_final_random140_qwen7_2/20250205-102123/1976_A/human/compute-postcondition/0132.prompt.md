Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of strings where each string represents a password of length 1 <= n <= 20 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
Code of the loop:
for n, password in test_cases:
    letters = ''
    digits = ''
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isalpha():
            letters += ch
        elif ch.isdigit():
            digits += ch
    if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(
        digits[0]):
        results.append('NO')
    else:
        results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO'. If the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`, `results` becomes ['NO']. Otherwise, 'YES' is appended to `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is an empty string, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, `digits` contains all numeric characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared. If the last character in `letters` has a higher index in the password than the first character in `digits`, `results` is ['NO']. Otherwise, `results` is ['YES'].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `results` is either ['NO', 'NO'], ['NO', 'NO', 'YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the last character processed from `password`, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`. If the last letter in `letters` appears later in the password than the first digit in `digits`, `results` remains ['NO', 'NO']. Otherwise, `results` is updated to ['NO', 'NO', 'YES'] if either the letters in `letters` are not sorted or the digits in `digits` are not sorted.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
