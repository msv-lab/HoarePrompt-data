Postcondition: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the original `password`, `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the original `password`. The current state satisfies that the list of letters is not sorted or the list of digits is not sorted.**
