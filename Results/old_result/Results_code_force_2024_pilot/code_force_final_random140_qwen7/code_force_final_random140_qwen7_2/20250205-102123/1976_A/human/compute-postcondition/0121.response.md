Output State: **`results` is ['NO', 'NO'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the last character processed from `password`, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password`, `digits` contains all numeric characters from `password`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `results`, `n`, `password`, `ch`, `letters`, and `digits` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect these variables, so their states are the same as the initial state.
