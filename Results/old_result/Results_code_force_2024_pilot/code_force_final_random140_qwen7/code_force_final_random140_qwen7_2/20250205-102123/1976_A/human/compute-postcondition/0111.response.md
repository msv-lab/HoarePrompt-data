Output State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the same as before, `ch` is the next character in `password`, `letters` includes the current character `ch` if it is alphabetic, `digits` includes the current character `ch` if it is a digit, and `digits` is updated to include the current character `ch` if it is a digit.**

Explanation: The code `digits += ch` appends the character `ch` to the `digits` string if `ch` is a digit. The other variables (`results`, `n`, `password`, `ch`, `letters`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects these conditions.
