### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes the number of test cases (`t`) and a list of tuples containing the length of the password and the password itself.
   - It initializes two empty strings, `letters` and `digits`, to store the letters and digits from the password.
   - It iterates through each character in the password, appending letters to `letters` and digits to `digits`.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If they are not, it appends 'NO' to the results list and moves to the next test case.
   - However, the check for the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0]):` is incorrect. This condition checks if the last letter appears before the first digit, which is the opposite of the requirement. The correct condition should be `if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) < password.index(digits[0]):`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement except for the check regarding the order of letters and digits.
- The current implementation incorrectly allows passwords where digits come after letters, which violates the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly enforce the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
