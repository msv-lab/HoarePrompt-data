Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of strings where each string represents a password of length 1 <= n <= 20 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
