Output State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the remaining part of the original `password` after removing the current character `ch`, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the next character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged, `digits` is updated by adding the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.**

Explanation: The code `digits += ch` appends the current character `ch` to the string `digits` if `ch` is a digit. All other variables (`results`, `n`, `password`, and `letters`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
