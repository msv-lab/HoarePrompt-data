Postcondition: `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is an empty string, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, `digits` contains all numeric characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, and the final state of `letters` and `digits` is such that if `list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits)`, then `results` contains 'NO'. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged.
