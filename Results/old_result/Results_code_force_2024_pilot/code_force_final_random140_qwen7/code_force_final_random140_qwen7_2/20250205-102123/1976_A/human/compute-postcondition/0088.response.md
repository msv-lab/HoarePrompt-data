Output State: **`results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the next password in the sequence, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string.**

The code `digits = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `digits`. All other variables (`results`, `n`, `password`, and `letters`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
