Postcondition: `results` is either an empty list or contains the string 'NO'. If the last character of `letters` appears later in the `password` than the first character of `digits`, `results` contains 'NO'. Otherwise, 'YES' is appended to `results`. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from the original `password`, and `digits` is a string containing all numeric characters from the original `password`.
