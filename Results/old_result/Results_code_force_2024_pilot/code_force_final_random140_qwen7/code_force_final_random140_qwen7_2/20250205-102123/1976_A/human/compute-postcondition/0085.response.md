Postcondition: `results` is either ['NO'] or ['YES'], `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is an empty string, `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared, `digits` contains all numeric characters from the original `password` concatenated in the order they appeared. If the last character in `letters` has a higher index in the password than the first character in `digits`, `results` is ['NO']. Otherwise, `results` is ['YES'].
