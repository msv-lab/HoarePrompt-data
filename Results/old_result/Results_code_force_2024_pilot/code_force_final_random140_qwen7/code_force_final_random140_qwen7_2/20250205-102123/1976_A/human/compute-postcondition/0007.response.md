Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` must have at least one character, `letters` is the string containing the first character of `password`, `digits` is an empty string, `ch` is the first character of `password`.**

Explanation: The code `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` (which is an alphabetic character) to the string `letters`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
