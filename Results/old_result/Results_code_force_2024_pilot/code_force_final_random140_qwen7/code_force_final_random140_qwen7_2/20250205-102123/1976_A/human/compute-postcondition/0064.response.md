Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. This means the loop variable is `ch`, and the object being iterated over is `password`.

2. **Determine the Postconditions**: 
   - `results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO'.
   - `n` is the next value in the sequence.
   - `password` is not an empty string.
   - `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the next character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged.
   - `digits` contains the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit and `digits` is updated by adding the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character `ch` in `password`, at the start of the next iteration, `ch` will be the next character in `password`.
   - `results` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays as it is.
   - `n` is the next value in the sequence, which means it will be incremented or updated based on the sequence logic.
   - `password` will be the remaining part of the string after removing the current character `ch`.
   - `letters` will be updated if the next character `ch` is alphabetic.
   - `digits` will be updated if the next character `ch` is a digit.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `ch`, `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits`.

Here is the final state after adjusting for the next iteration:

**State: **`results` is either an empty list or contains 'NO', `n` is the next value in the sequence, `password` is the remaining part of the original `password` after removing the current character `ch`, `letters` is the concatenation of the original `letters` and the next character `ch` if `ch` is alphabetic, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged, `digits` contains the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit and `digits` is updated by adding the next character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.**
