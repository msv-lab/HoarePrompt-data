The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of strings representing passwords. For each password in `test_cases`, it checks if the password meets certain conditions related to the order of letters and digits within the password. If all passwords meet the conditions, it returns a list containing 'YES'; otherwise, it returns a list containing 'NO' repeated `t` times.
