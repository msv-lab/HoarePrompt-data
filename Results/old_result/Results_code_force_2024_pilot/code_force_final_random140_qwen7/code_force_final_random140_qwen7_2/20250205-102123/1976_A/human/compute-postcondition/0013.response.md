Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the tuple extracted from `test_cases`, `password` must have at least one character, `digits` is the first character of `password`, and `ch` is the first character of `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is set to `ch`.
