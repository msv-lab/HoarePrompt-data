Output State: **`hd` is equal to the number of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer. All other variables (`hd`, `t`, `s1`, `s2`, and `res`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
