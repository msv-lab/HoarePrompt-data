Output State: **`hd` is equal to the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`hd`, `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for `n`, which now holds the value of the integer input by the user.
