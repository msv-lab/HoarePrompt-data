Output State: **`hd` is equal to the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s2` is updated to the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s2` to the string input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
