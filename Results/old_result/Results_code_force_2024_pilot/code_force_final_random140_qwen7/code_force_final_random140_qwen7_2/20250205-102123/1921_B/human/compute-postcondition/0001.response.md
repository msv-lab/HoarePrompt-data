State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, _ is not a variable and does not need adjustment**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range of `t`. It does not hold any state that affects the loop's execution.
- The variable `t` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head that can affect the loop's execution. For the loop to run, `t` must be an integer within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)).

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is an integer within the given range.
