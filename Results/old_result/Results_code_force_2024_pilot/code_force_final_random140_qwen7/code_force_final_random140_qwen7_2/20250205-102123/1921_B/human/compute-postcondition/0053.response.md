Postcondition: `hd` is 1, `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and is decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s2` is updated to the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.
