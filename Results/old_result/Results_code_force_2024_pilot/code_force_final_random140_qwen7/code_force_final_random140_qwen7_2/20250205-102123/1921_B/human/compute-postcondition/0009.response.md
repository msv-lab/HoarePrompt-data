Output State: **`hd` is 1, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `i` is 0, the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `hd` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
