Output State: **`hd` is 2, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is updated to the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2', `i` is `i` + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `hd` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
