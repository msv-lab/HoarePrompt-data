Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user.**

The code `s2 = input()` assigns the value of the next input from the user to the variable `s2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s1` remain unchanged.
