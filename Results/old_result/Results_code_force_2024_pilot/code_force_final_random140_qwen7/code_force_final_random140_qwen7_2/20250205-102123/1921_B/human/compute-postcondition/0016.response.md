Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `hd` is 2
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `s1` is the string input by the user
   - `s2` is the string input by the user
   - `i` is 1
   - If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is set to 2.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - All other variables (`hd`, `t`, `s1`, `s2`) remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop, but since the loop body is omitted, these variables stay as they are.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `hd` is 2 (unchanged)
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged)
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
   - `s1` is the string input by the user (unchanged)
   - `s2` is the string input by the user (unchanged)
   - `i` is 2 (incremented from 1)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`hd` is 2, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `i` is 2**
