Output State: **Postcondition: `hd` is equal to the number of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, and `i` is the last index processed by the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `hd` will hold the total count of positions where the characters in `s1` do not match the corresponding characters in `s2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still within the specified range. The variable `n` also remains unchanged and must be greater than 0. The strings `s1` and `s2` are the ones input by the user. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating the last index that was processed in the loop.
