Output State: **`hd` is 0, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `s1` is updated to the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `hd` to 0. This means the variable `hd` is now set to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
