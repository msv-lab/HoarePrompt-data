Postcondition: **`hd` is 2, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is updated to the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `i` is `i` + 1. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` changes to 2.**
