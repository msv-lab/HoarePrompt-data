Output State: **`hd` is equal to the number of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `s1` is updated to the string input by the user, `s2` is the string input by the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `s2` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
