Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` and the list `A` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user.
