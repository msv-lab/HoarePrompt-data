Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and the initial conditions for `n` and the whiteboard numbers remain unchanged**.

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, while the values of `n` and the whiteboard numbers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` stay as they were in the initial state, with `n` still being an integer between 1 and 50, and each `a_i` being an integer between 1 and \(10^7\).
