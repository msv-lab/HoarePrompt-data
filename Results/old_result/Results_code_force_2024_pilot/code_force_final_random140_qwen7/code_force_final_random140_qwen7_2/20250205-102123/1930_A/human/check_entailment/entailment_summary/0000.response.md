Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the maximum final score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. However, the given program simply sums every second integer in the list, which does not necessarily maximize the score.

To illustrate, consider the example test case where the input is:
```
2
2
1 1 2 1
```

The program's output would be:
```
2
```

But the correct output should be:
```
2
```

However, this specific example happens to give the correct answer by coincidence. For a general solution, the program needs to sort the array and then sum up the first half of the sorted array, as this approach ensures that the minimum of each pair is maximized.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum final score.

Correctness: **False**
