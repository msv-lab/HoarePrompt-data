Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `A`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer is preserved.
