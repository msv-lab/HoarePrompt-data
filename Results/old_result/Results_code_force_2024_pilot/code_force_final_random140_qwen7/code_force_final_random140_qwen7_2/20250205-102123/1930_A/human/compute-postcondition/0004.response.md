Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be non-zero. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` is an input integer. This variable is also not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it.
   - `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. Since the input string is not provided, let's denote the input string as `input_str`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum(A[::2]))
   ```
   - `A[::2]` means every second element of the list `A`, starting from the first element.
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

Given the above, the output will depend on the specific input string `input_str`. Let's assume an example input string to illustrate the process:

Suppose `input_str = "1,2,3,4,5"`. Then:
- Splitting the string by commas gives us `["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]`.
- Converting each element to an integer results in the list `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- `A[::2]` will give `[1, 3, 5]`.
- The sum of these elements is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of every second element in the list `A`.

Output: **9 (where the sum is calculated as the sum of every second element in the list A obtained from the input string)**
