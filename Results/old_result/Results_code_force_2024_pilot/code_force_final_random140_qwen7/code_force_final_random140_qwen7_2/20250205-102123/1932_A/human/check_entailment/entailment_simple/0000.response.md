Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Path Length and String Reading**: For each test case, it correctly reads the length `d` of the path and the string `b` representing the path.
3. **Coin Counting Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `b`.
   - When it encounters a `'@'`, it increments the counter `s` to count the coins.
   - When it encounters a `'*'`, it checks if it's the last character or if the next character is also a `'*'`. If either condition is true, it breaks out of the loop, ensuring no further invalid moves are considered.
4. **Output**: After processing the string for each test case, it prints the total number of coins collected `s` and resets `s` for the next test case.
5. **Loop Execution**: The loop correctly handles all test cases as per the problem statement, and the final state of variables aligns with the expected behavior post-loop execution.

Given these points, the program logic matches the problem requirements and correctly calculates the maximum number of coins that can be collected for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
