Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(len(b))`.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `s` is 1
   - `j` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `b` is an input string with at least 1 character
   - `b[0]` is not '*'
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `b[j] == '@'`

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < len(b)`.

4. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is 1
   - `j` is 0 (the loop just finished its first iteration)
   - `i` is 2
   - `b` is an input string with at least 1 character
   - `b[0]` is not '*'
   - The loop has not yet checked `b[0]` for `@`

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0, the next iteration would increment `j` to 1.
   - The new value of `j` will be 1.
   - The condition `b[j] == '@'` needs to be checked with `j = 1`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `s` remains 1 unless `b[1] == '@'`.
   - `j` is incremented to 1.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `b[0]` is still not '*', but now we need to check `b[1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `b` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b[0]` is not '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `b[j] == '@'`.**
