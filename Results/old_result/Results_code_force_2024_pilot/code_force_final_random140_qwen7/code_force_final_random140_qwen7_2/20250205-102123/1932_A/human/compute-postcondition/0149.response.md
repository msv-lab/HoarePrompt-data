Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through stdin. It reads an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, followed by a string of `n` characters representing a row of cells ('.', '@', '*'). The function returns a series of outputs, one for each test case, indicating whether a path exists from the first cell to the last cell without stepping on coins ('@') or thorns ('*').**

Note: The actual logic to determine the path and the specific return values are not described here as per the instructions.
