Output State: **`s` is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `b[j] == '@'`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it simply means that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement that was present before the given code snippet. The values of the variables `s`, `j`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `b[j] == '@'` remains as a potential condition to break out of a hypothetical loop or if statement.
