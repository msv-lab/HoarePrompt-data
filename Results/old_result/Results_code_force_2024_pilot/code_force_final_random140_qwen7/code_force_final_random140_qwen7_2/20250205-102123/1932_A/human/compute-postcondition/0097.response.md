Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(a)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `s` is 0
   - `j` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `d` is an input integer

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `a` must remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `s` remains 0.
   - `j` remains 0.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `d` remains an input integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `d` is an input integer**
