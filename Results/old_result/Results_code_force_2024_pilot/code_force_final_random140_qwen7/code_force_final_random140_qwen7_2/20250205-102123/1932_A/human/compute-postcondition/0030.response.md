Postcondition: **`j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of whether the condition `j == len(b) - 1` is true or false, the same conditions apply: `j` is incremented by 1, `b` remains a non-empty string, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one.
