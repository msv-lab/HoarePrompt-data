Output State: **`s` is 1 if `b[j-1]` is '@', otherwise `s` remains 0; `j` is equal to the length of the string `b`; `i` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there was no loop or conditional block specified in the initial state, the `break` statement simply indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged as there were no assignments or operations performed on them within the context of the given code snippet.
