Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
During your journey through computer universes, you stumbled upon a very
interesting world. It is a path with n consecutive cells, each of which can
either be empty, contain thorns, or a coin. In one move, you can move one or
two cells along the path, provided that the destination cell does not contain
thorns (and belongs to the path). If you move to the cell with a coin, you
pick it up.

Here, green arrows correspond to legal moves, and the red arrow corresponds to
an illegal move.

You want to collect as many coins as possible. Find the maximum number of
coins you can collect in the discovered world if you start in the leftmost
cell of the path.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the length of the path.

The second line of each test case contains a string of n characters, the
description of the path. The character '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes
a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. It is guaranteed that
the first cell is empty.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer, the maximum number of coins you
can collect.

Example

    .@@*@.**@@
    
    5

Output

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. Additionally, the first cell is guaranteed to be empty ('.')
def func():
    a = int(input())
    s = 0
    for i in range(a):
        d = int(input())
        
        b = input()
        
        for j in range(len(b)):
            if b[j] == '@':
                s = s + 1
            elif b[j] == '*':
                if j == len(b) - 1:
                    break
                elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                    break
        
        print(s)
        
        s = 0
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of the string `b`, `i` is 999 (since `a` is the upper limit of the range in the loop, and the loop runs from 0 to `a-1`), `d` is an input integer for each iteration, and `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
    #
    #This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `s` will be reset to 0 at the end of the last iteration, `j` will be equal to the length of the string `b` (as it is checked at the end of the inner loop), `i` will be 999 (the last value it takes before the loop ends), `d` will hold the last input integer received during the loop, and `t` will remain unchanged because it was not involved in any operations within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters ('.', '@', '*'). For each test case, it counts the number of coins ('@') in the string and prints the count. After processing all test cases, it resets the count to zero and continues to the next test case until all `t` test cases are processed. The function does not return any value but prints the count of coins for each test case.
