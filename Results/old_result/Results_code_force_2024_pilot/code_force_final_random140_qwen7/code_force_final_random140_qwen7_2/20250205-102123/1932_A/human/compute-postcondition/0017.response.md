Postcondition: `j` is an integer, `b` is a non-empty string, and if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one. If the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
