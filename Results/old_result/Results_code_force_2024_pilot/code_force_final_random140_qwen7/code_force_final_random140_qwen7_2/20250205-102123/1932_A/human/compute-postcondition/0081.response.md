Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(len(b))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than the length of the string `b`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is 2 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1.
   - `j` is the length of the string `b`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `d` is an input integer.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is equal to the length of the string `b` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the loop has already completed all its iterations.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `b`. Therefore, `j` should be set to a value less than the current length of `b`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would actually be the first iteration) should be:

- `s` remains unchanged because it depends on the value of `b[j]`, which hasn't been evaluated yet.
- `j` is set to 0, as this is the first iteration of the loop.
- `i` remains 1.
- `d` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
- We are not breaking out of the loop since it is the first iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is 2 if `b[0]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1; `j` is 0; `i` is 1; `d` is an input integer**
