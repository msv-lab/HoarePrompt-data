Output State: **`s` is 2, `j` is the length of the string `b`, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The initial state defines that `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0. Also, `j` is equal to the length of the string `b`, `i` is 1, and `d` is an input integer. The code snippet `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Since `s` was initially 1 (or 0, but in both cases, adding 1 will make it 2), it now becomes 2. The values of `j`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged.
