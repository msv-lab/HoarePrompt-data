Output State: **`j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All other conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
