Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to the length of the string `b`, `s` will be the total count of '@' characters in the string `b`, and `i` will be 0. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `b` remains the same as it was initially provided.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop would have iterated through each character in the string `b`. For every '@' character encountered, the counter `s` increments by 1. The loop breaks early if it encounters two consecutive '*' characters or reaches the end of the string. The variable `i` remains 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The variables `t` and `b` retain their initial values since they were not altered by the loop.
