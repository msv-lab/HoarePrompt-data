Output State: `s` is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `b` is an input string.

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop has been executed up to the third iteration. The final state of the variables after these iterations is `s` is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, and `b` is an input string. Since no further iterations are specified, and the loop breaks when certain conditions are met (either finding '@' or encountering '**'), it is reasonable to assume that the loop will not continue beyond the third iteration without new conditions being met. Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished remains as described.
