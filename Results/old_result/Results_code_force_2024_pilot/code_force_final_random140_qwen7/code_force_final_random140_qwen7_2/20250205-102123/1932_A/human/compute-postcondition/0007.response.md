Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', `s` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `s + 1`, which means `s` is incremented by 1. Initially, `s` was not defined, so it is assigned the value 1. The values of `j` and `b` remain unchanged.
