Output State: **`s` is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `b[j] == '@'`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or if statement specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. The conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
