Output State: **`s` is 2 if `b[0]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1; `j` is 0; `i` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `s`, `j`, or `i`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the code, we assume it refers to the most internal one. The value of `d` remains unchanged as it was not involved in any operation.
