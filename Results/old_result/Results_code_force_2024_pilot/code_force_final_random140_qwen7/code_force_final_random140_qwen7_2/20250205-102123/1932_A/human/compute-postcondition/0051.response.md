Output State: **`s` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of the string `input()`, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input string, but the values of the other variables (`s`, `j`, `i`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The length of the string `b` is stored in `j`.
