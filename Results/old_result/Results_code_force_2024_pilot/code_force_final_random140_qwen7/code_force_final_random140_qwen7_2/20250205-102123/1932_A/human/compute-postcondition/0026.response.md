Output State: **`j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of `j` and `b` remain as they were before the statement was executed. Additionally, the condition that the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one, still holds true.
