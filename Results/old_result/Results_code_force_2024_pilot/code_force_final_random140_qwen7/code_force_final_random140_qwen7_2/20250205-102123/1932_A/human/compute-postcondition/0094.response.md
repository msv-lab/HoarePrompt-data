Output State: `s` is 3, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer.

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop continues to increment `s` each time it encounters an '@' character in the string `b`. The loop breaks if it encounters two consecutive '*' characters or reaches the end of the string. After executing the loop until the end of the string or encountering a break condition, `s` will hold the total count of '@' characters encountered, `j` will be reset to 0 (as the loop restarts from the beginning upon completion), `i` remains 1 (unchanged throughout the loop), and `d` remains an input integer (unchanged).
