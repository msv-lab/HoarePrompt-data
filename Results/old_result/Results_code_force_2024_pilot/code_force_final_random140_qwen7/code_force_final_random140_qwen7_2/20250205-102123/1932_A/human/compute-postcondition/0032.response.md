Postcondition: `j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
