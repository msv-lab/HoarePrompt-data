Postcondition: `j` is an integer, `b` is a non-empty string. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, if the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, `j` remains 0, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one.
