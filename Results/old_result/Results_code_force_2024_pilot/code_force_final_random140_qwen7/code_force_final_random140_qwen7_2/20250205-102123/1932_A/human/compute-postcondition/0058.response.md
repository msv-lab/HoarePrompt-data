Output State: **`s` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of the string `b` minus 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since there was no loop or if statement specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
