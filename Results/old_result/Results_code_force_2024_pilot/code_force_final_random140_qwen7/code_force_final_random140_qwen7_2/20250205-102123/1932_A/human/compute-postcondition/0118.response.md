Postcondition: `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@'. Otherwise, `s` is 0, `j` is either 0 or equal to the length of `b` minus 1, `i` is 2, `b` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b[j]` is not '@', and if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, if `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus 1, we ensure that the next character `b[j + 1]` is not '*'.
