Output State: `s` is 3, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer.

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop continues to increment `s` each time it encounters an '@' character in the string `b`. The loop breaks if it encounters two consecutive '*' characters or reaches the end of the string. Given that the loop executed 3 times, it means `s` was incremented three times, which can only happen if there were three '@' characters in the string before the loop encountered a '*' character or reached the end. After the third iteration, `j` resets to 0 because the loop condition checks the entire string again from the beginning, and `i` and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
