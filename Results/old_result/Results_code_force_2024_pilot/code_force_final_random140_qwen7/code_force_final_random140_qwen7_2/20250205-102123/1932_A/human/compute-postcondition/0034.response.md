Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and the string `b`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `b`. Additionally, the character at index `j` of `b` should not be '*', and `j` should not be equal to the length of `b` minus one.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value.
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - The character at index `j` of `b` is not '*'.
   - `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one.
   - If the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2.
   - If the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', we break out of the loop.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `b` and the character at index `j` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one, we need to increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The character at the new index `j` (which is `j + 1`) should still not be '*', and it should not be equal to the length of `b` minus one.
   - If the character at the new index `j` is '@', then `s` will be 2. If it is '*', the loop will break, but since we are considering the next iteration, this condition does not apply here.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - The character at the new index `j` should not be '*', and it should not be equal to the length of `b` minus one.
   - The postcondition for the loop to continue is that `j` is less than the length of `b` and the character at index `j` is not '*'.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2.**
