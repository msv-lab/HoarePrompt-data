Output State: **`s` is 1, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b[0]` is not '*'**

The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Initially, `s` is 0, so after executing this line, `s` becomes 1. The values of `j`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
