Output State: **`s` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of the string `b`, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer.**

The code `d = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `d`. The values of `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The length of the string `b` is stored in `j`, and `i` remains 1. The variable `t` is not mentioned in the code and thus remains unaffected.
