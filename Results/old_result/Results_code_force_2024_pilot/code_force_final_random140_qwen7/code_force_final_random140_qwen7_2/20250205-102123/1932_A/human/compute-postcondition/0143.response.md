Output State: `s` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to the length of `b` minus 1, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `b[j] == '@'`. If `b[j] == '*'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `s` remains 1 because it was incremented only once when `b[j]` was '@'. The variable `j` will be less than or equal to the length of the string `b` minus one because the loop continues as long as `j` is within the bounds of the string. The variable `i` remains 2 as it is not modified by the loop. The loop breaks if `b[j]` is either '@' or '*'.
