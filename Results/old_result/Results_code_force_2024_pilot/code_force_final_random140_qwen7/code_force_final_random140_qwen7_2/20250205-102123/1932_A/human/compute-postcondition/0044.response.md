Postcondition: `j` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `j` is not equal to the length of `b` minus one. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', `s` is 3. If the character at index `j` of `b` is not '@' and the character at index `j+1` of `b` is '*', the loop or if statement is broken. If the character at index `j+1` of `b` is not '*', `s` remains unchanged from the precondition.
