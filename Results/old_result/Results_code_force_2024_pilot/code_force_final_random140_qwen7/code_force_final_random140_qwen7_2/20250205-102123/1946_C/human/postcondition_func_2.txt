The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), and three integers n, k, and x. It first calls another function `func_1` to get the number of good components (`good_components`) and the size of the remaining connected component (`remaining_size`). If the number of good components is greater than k, it returns True. If the number of good components is exactly k and the remaining size is at least x, it also returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
