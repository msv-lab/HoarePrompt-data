Postcondition: **`stack` contains a series of tuples `(u, False)`, where `u` is each successive child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. The exact number of tuples in the stack depends on the total number of children that `v` has. `v` remains unchanged. `postorder` remains `False`. `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
