Output State: **`stack` now contains a tuple `(v, True)` appended to its previous contents, `v` is now the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with the popped vertex `v`, the value of `good_components[v]` is updated to `0`, the value of `remaining_size[v]` is also updated based on the remaining children of `v` and their respective `remaining_size` values.**

Explanation: The code sets `good_components[v]` to `0`. This updates the value of `good_components[v]` while keeping the other conditions and values unchanged.
