Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, an edge is added between node `u - 1` and node `v - 1` in the tree.**

The code adds an edge between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
