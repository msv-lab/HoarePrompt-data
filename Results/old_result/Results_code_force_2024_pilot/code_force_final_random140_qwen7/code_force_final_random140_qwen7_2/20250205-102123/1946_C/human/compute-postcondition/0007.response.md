Output State: **`i` is 2, `[u - 1, v - 1]` is updated to `[input integer - 1, input integer - 1]`, and an edge is added between nodes u-1 and v-1 in the tree.**

Explanation: The code adds an edge between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree. The values of `i` and the list `[u - 1, v - 1]` are updated to `[int(input()) - 1, int(input()) - 1]` based on user input. The exact values of `u` and `v` are not known until the input is provided, but they are updated accordingly. The tree structure now includes an additional edge.
