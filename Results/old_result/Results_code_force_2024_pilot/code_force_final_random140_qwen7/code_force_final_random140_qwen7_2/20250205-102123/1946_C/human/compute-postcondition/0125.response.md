Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `tree` (an instance of a Tree class), `s` (an integer representing the starting vertex), and `x` (an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges). It returns a tuple `(good_components[s], remaining_size[s])` where `good_components[s]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children`, plus the number of child vertices `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.**
