Output State: **`u` is a child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated by adding `good_components[u]` to it, `remaining_size[v]` is updated by adding `remaining_size[u]` to its current value, and `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.**

This means that the `remaining_size` of vertex `v` has been updated by adding the `remaining_size` of its child vertex `u` to it. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
