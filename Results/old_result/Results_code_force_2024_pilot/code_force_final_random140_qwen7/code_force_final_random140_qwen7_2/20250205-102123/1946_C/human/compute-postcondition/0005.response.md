Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `[u - 1, v - 1]` is a list of two integers representing an edge added to the tree.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but it is required to determine if the loop should continue.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `[u - 1, v - 1]` remains the same since it is not part of the loop head and its value is not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `[u - 1, v - 1]` is a list of two integers representing an edge added to the tree**
