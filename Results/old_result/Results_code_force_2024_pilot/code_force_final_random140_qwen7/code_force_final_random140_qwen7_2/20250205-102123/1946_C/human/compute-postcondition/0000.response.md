Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `k` is an integer obtained from input, both 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5**.

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified in the initial state, they are now defined as integers obtained from the input, maintaining the condition 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. All other variables and their initial conditions remain unchanged.
