Functionality: **The function accepts a tree structure represented by an instance `tree`, a root vertex `v`, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing the edges. It returns two values: `good_components`, which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus additional increments based on the condition, and `remaining_size`, which is the final aggregated value after all iterations.**
