Output State: **`beg` is `mid`, `end` is either `n` or `mid - 1`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `mid` is updated to be the integer division of the sum of `beg` and `end` plus one, divided by two. Since `beg` is initially `mid` and `end` is either `n` or `mid - 1` depending on the return value of `func_3`, the new value of `mid` is calculated based on these conditions.
