You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of nodes in a tree and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k < n. It also takes a `tree` object, which represents a tree structure with `n` nodes. The function reads the tree edges from standard input, roots the tree at node 0 using a non-recursive approach, and then calls another function `func_4` to compute and return the maximum number `x` based on the given tree and values of `n` and `k`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing**:
   - The `func_5` function reads the input and constructs a tree.
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree`, which is not defined in the provided code but assumed to have methods like `add_edge` and `root_tree_non_recursive`.

2. **Finding the Maximum `x`**:
   - The main logic is in `func_4`, which uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x`.
   - The binary search range is between 1 and `n`.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, `func_3` is called to check if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `mid` vertices.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to compute the number of good components (components with at least `x` vertices) and the total remaining size.
   - `func_1` performs a post-order traversal to calculate these values.
   - If the number of good components is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components equals `k` and the total remaining size is at least `x`, then `func_3` returns `True`.

4. **Post-Order Traversal**:
   - `func_1` uses a post-order traversal to ensure that all children of a node are processed before the node itself.
   - It maintains two dictionaries: `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - `good_components[v]` stores the number of good components rooted at vertex `v`.
   - `remaining_size[v]` stores the total size of the subtree rooted at vertex `v` that meets the condition.

### Potential Issues

1. **Tree Class Implementation**:
   - The `Tree` class is not provided, and its implementation might not be correct.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is also not defined, and its correctness is assumed.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that the tree is correctly constructed and that the input is valid.
   - There is no explicit handling for edge cases where the tree structure might cause issues during traversal.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic seems correct, but it relies on the correctness of `func_3`, which in turn relies on `func_1`.

### Conclusion

Given that the provided functions seem logically sound and the binary search approach is correct, assuming the `Tree` class and methods are implemented correctly, the program should work as intended.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
