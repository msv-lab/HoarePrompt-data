Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times, with `i` being `n-1`. For each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, an edge has been added between nodes `u-1` and `v-1` in the tree, where `[u, v]` are pairs of integers provided as input. The variable `n` represents the total number of nodes in the tree, and `k` remains unchanged from its initial value. The tree object contains all the edges added through the loop, forming a connected graph with no cycles (as it is constructed using `n-1` edges for `n` nodes).
