t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The graph is represented as a tree with n vertices, and each of the n - 1 lines contains two integers v and u representing an edge between vertices v and u. The sum of the values of n for all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.
