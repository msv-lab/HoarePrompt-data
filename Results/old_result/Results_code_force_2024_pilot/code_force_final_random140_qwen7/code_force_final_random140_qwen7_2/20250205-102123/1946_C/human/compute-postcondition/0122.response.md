Output State: `stack` is empty, as it will be emptied out during the iterations of the loop until there are no more elements to process. `v` will be set to the last vertex processed before the stack became empty. `postorder` will be `True` for `v` since the loop terminates when the stack is empty and all vertices have been processed in a postorder fashion. `good_components[v]` will contain the final count of good components rooted at `v`, which is determined by recursively summing up the `good_components` values of all its descendants and adding 1 for each descendant whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size[v]` will hold the total size of all remaining good components rooted at `v`, which is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all descendants `u` of `v` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, the `stack` is empty, `v` is the last processed vertex, `postorder` is `True`, `good_components[v]` reflects the total count of good components considering the condition `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size[v]` reflects the total size of remaining good components under the same condition.
