Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Use of Functions**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are not properly implemented to solve the problem as described.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be trying to traverse the tree and calculate some properties, but they are not correctly designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum `x`.

2. **Tree Class Missing**:
   - The code references a `Tree` class, but this class is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without the definition of the `Tree` class, it's impossible to understand how the tree operations are performed.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_4` is intended to find the maximum `x`, but the conditions inside `func_3` are not correctly checking whether the current `x` value is feasible.

4. **Rooting the Tree**:
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is called, but its implementation is not provided. If this method is supposed to root the tree, it should be correctly implemented to ensure that the tree structure is properly handled.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling part (`func_5`) seems to be correct, but the rest of the functions need to be implemented correctly to solve the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a function that performs a binary search over possible values of `x` and checks if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. The key steps would involve:
- Rooting the tree.
- Performing a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the size of each subtree.
- Using binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

Here is a high-level outline of what the correct solution might look like:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Tree:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.children = defaultdict(list)
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        self.children[u].append(v)
        self.children[v].append(u)
    
    def dfs(self, node, parent, sizes):
        sizes[node] = 1
        for child in self.children[node]:
            if child != parent:
                self.dfs(child, node, sizes)
                sizes[node] += sizes[child]

def max_x(n, k, edges):
    tree = Tree(n)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree.add_edge(u, v)
    
    sizes = [0] * n
    tree.dfs(0, -1, sizes)
    
    beg, end = 1, n
    while beg < end:
        mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
        if is_possible(tree, n, k, mid, sizes):
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid - 1
    return beg

def is_possible(tree, n, k, x, sizes):
    # Implement this function to check if it's possible to remove k edges
    # such that each remaining component has at least x nodes
    pass

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
        print(max_x(n, k, edges))
```

This approach ensures that the tree is correctly rooted, the sizes of subtrees are calculated, and the binary search is used to find the maximum `x`.
