You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. tree is an instance of a custom Tree class representing the tree structure with n vertices, where each vertex is identified by an index from 0 to n-1. The add_edge method of the Tree class is used to add edges between vertices. The root_tree_non_recursive method is used to root the tree at vertex 0 using a non-recursive approach. The func_4 function is expected to compute the maximum number x based on the given tree and values of n and k.
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times, setting `i` to `n-1`. For each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, an edge was added to the tree between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers provided as input. The final state of the tree will have `n` nodes connected by `n-1` edges, forming a tree structure. All nodes from 0 to `n-1` will be reachable from any other node through these edges.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: func_4(tree, n, k) (where tree is a tree structure with n nodes and n-1 edges, and k is an integer)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n (an integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k < n), and tree (an instance of a custom Tree class). It computes and returns the maximum number x based on the given tree structure and values of n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
