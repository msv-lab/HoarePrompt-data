Output State: The loop will terminate when `beg` equals `end`.

In the given loop, `beg` starts at 1 and `end` starts at `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `beg` is less than `end`. Each iteration adjusts either `beg` or `end` based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. After multiple iterations, `beg` and `end` will converge to the same value because each adjustment brings them closer together until they meet.

Since the loop stops when `beg` equals `end`, the final values of `beg`, `end`, and `mid` will all be the same. The exact value depends on the conditions under which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` evaluates to `True` or `False` during the iterations, but the key point is that the loop terminates when `beg` and `end` are equal.
