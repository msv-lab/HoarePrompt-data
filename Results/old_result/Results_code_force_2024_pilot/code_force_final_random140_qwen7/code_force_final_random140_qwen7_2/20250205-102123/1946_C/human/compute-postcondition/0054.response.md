Output State: The stack will contain a series of tuples (u, False), where each u is a child vertex of v in the tree, and the list of these tuples will be equivalent to a depth-first traversal of the subtree rooted at v, with each tuple indicating that the corresponding vertex has not yet been processed.

In more detail, the stack will contain all the children of v, each marked as not processed (False), in the order they were added. If the tree has n children at vertex v, the stack will end up containing n tuples (u_i, False), where u_i represents each child vertex in some order determined by the specific structure of the tree and the order in which the children were initially processed.
