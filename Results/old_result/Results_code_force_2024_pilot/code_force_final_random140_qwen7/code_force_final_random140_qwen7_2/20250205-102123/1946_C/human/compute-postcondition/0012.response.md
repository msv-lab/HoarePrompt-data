Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times, setting `i` to `n-1`. For each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, an edge was added to the tree between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers provided as input. The final state of the tree will have `n` nodes connected by `n-1` edges, forming a tree structure. All nodes from 0 to `n-1` will be reachable from any other node through these edges.
