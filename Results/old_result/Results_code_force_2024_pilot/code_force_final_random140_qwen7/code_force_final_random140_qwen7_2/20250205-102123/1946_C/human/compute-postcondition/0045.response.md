Output State: **`stack` now contains (v, True) as its last element, `v` is the last element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is set to `True`, `good_components[v]` is 0, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

Explanation: The line `good_components[v] = 0` sets the value of `good_components[v]` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
