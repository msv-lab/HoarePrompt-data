### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in connected components of size at least \( x \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function calculates the number of "good" components and the remaining size of these components after considering a threshold \( x \). However, the implementation of `func_1` seems incomplete and does not directly solve the problem as intended. The function should be used to find the number of components that can be separated by removing \( k \) edges, but it doesn't seem to do that correctly.
   - **`func_2`**: This function is recursive and aims to process the tree to determine the number of "good" components and the remaining size. It seems to be a helper function for `func_1`.
   - **`func_3`**: This function checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if the number of good components is exactly \( k \) and the remaining size is at least \( x \). It uses `func_1` to get the necessary values.
   - **`func_4`**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the conditions. It uses `func_3` to check the validity of \( x \).
   - **`func_5`**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the required \( x \).

3. **Key Issues**:
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`**: These functions do not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. They do not properly handle the removal of edges and the calculation of the resulting component sizes.
   - **`func_3`**: This function assumes that `func_1` provides the correct information, but since `func_1` is flawed, `func_3` cannot work as intended.
   - **`func_4`**: This function relies on `func_3` to determine the correct \( x \), but since `func_3` is based on incorrect logic, `func_4` will not produce the right result.

Given these issues, the overall logic of the program is flawed, and the functions do not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
