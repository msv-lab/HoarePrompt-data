Output State: **`stack` now contains a tuple `(v, True)` appended to its previous contents, `v` is now the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with the popped vertex `v`, the value of `good_components[v]` is updated based on the remaining children of `v` and their respective `remaining_size` values relative to `x`, the value of `remaining_size[v]` is also updated based on the remaining children of `v` and their respective `remaining_size` values.**

This means that the tuple `(v, True)` has been appended to the `stack`, indicating that the vertex `v` is now being processed in a way that tracks whether it has been visited before. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
