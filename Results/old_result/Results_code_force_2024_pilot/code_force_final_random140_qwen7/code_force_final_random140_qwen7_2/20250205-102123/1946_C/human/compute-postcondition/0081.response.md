Postcondition: **`good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.**
