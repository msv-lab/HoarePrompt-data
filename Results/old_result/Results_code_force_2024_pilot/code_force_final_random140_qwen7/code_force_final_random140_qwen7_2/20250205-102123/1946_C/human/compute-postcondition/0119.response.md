Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `good_components[v]` will contain the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. Additionally, if the `remaining_size[u]` of any child vertex `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` will be incremented by 1 for each such child. The variable `remaining_size[v]` will be updated to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `good_components[v]` will reflect the total count of components that meet the size requirement `x` among all descendants of `v`, and `remaining_size[v]` will represent the combined `remaining_size` of all child vertices of `v`.
