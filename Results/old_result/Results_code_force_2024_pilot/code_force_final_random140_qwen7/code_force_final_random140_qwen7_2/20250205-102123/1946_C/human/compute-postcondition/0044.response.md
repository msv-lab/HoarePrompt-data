Output State: **`stack` now contains (v, True) as its last element, `v` is the last element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is set to `True`, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((v, True))` appends a tuple `(v, True)` to the stack. This means that the stack is now one element longer, and the last element of the stack is the tuple `(v, True)`. The value of `v` remains the same as it was before, being the last element popped from the stack. The other variables (`postorder`, `good_components[v]`, and `remaining_size[v]`) remain unchanged and retain their previous values.
