Output State: **`beg` is `mid`, `end` is either `n` or `mid - 1`, `mid` is `mid`**

Explanation: The variable `beg` is reassigned to the current value of `mid`. The values of `end` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `end` is either `n` or `mid - 1`, and `mid` is still `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.
