Output State: The loop will terminate when `beg` is equal to `end`.

In the given loop, `beg` starts at 1 and `end` starts at `n`. The loop continues as long as `beg` is less than `end`. Each iteration updates either `beg` or `end` based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. After several iterations, `beg` and `end` will converge to the same value, at which point the condition `beg < end` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.

Given that the loop has executed three times and the conditions described, we can infer that `beg` and `end` have narrowed down to a single value through successive halvings. Therefore, the final output state will have `beg` and `end` being equal to the same value, which is the result of the binary search process defined by the loop. The exact value depends on the behavior of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` but is not specified in the problem statement. The key point is that the loop terminates when `beg` equals `end`.
