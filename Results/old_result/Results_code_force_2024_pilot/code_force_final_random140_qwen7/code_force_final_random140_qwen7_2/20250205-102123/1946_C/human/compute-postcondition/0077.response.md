Postcondition: `good_components[v]'` is increased by either 1 (if `remaining_size[u] >= x` is true) or `good_components[u]'` (if `remaining_size[u] >= x` is false). Additionally, `remaining_size[v]'` is increased by `remaining_size[u]'` if `remaining_size[u] >= x` is false, and `u` is set to the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` in both cases.
