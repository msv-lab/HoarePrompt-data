Postcondition: `u` is a child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated by adding either `1` or `good_components[u]` to it depending on whether `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is updated based on the remaining children of `v` and their respective `remaining_size` values. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is incremented by `1`; otherwise, `good_components[v]` is incremented by `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is incremented by `remaining_size[u]`.
