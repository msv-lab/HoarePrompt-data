You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    good_components = {}
    remaining_size = {}
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            good_components[v] = 0
            remaining_size[v] = 1
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        elif postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                good_components[v] += good_components[u]
                if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                    good_components[v] += 1
                else:
                    remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]
        
    #State: Output State: `stack` is empty, `tree` remains an instance of the Tree class with its vertices and edges intact, `s` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `good_components` is a dictionary where the key is the starting vertex `s` and the value is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children`, plus the number of child vertices `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`. `remaining_size` is a dictionary where the key is the starting vertex `s` and the value is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.
    #
    #This final state occurs after the loop has processed all vertices in the tree through a depth-first search (DFS) traversal. The `stack` is emptied as all vertices are popped and processed. The `good_components` dictionary captures the count of good components for the starting vertex `s`, considering the sizes of its connected components after removing `k` edges. The `remaining_size` dictionary accumulates the sizes of the remaining components that do not meet the size requirement `x`.
    return good_components[s], remaining_size[s]
    #The program returns the tuple (good_components[s], remaining_size[s]) where `good_components[s]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children`, plus the number of child vertices `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `tree` (an instance of a Tree class), `s` (an integer representing the starting vertex), and `x` (an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges). It returns a tuple `(good_components[s], remaining_size[s])` where `good_components[s]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children`, plus the number of child vertices `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the tuple (good_components[s], remaining_size[s]) where `good_components[s]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children`, plus the number of child vertices `u` of `s` where `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size[s]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all child vertices `u` of `s` in `tree.vertices[s].children` where `remaining_size[u] < x`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
