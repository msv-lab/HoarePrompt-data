Functionality: **The function processes a tree structure to determine the number of "good" components and the remaining size of these components after considering a given threshold `x`. It recursively traverses the tree, counting components that meet specific criteria and aggregating sizes. The function returns two values: `good_components`, which is the total count of components meeting the criteria, and `remaining_size`, which is the combined size of these components.**
