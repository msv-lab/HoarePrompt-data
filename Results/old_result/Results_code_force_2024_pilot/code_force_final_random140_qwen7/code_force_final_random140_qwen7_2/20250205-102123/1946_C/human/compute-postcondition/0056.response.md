Postcondition: **`stack` is now one element shorter, `v` is the last element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is set to `False`, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`**
