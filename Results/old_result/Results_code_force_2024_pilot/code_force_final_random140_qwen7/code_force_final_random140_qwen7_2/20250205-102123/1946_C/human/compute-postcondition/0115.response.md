Output State: **`u` is the next child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]` and is now incremented by 1, `remaining_size[v]` will be updated based on the current `u`.**

In this output state, the variable `good_components[v]` has been incremented by 1, reflecting the addition of `good_components[u]` to it. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
