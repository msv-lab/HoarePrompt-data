Postcondition: **`u` is the next child vertex of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `v` is the vertex that was just popped from the stack, `postorder` is the postorder value associated with `v` and it is not `False`, `good_components[v]` is updated to include `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`**.
