Functionality: **The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges `k` to be removed. It then performs a binary search to find a specific value where the variables `beg` and `end` become equal after removing `k` edges from the tree. The function returns this value.**
