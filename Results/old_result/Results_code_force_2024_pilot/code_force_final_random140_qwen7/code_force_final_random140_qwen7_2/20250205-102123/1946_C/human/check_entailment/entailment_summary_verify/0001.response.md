### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, function summaries, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

#### Function Summaries Recap
- **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: Reads input, constructs a tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).
- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) by calling `func_3`.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Checks if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices by calling `func_1`.
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Performs a post-order traversal to compute the number of good components and the total remaining size.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing**
   - The `func_5` function correctly reads the input and constructs the tree.
   - The tree is rooted at node 0 using a non-recursive approach, and the root is stored in the `Tree` class.

2. **Finding the Maximum \( x \)**
   - The binary search in `func_4` is correctly implemented to find the maximum \( x \).
   - The key logic is in `func_3`, which checks the feasibility of the current \( x \) by calling `func_1`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to perform a post-order traversal.
   - `func_1` correctly computes the number of good components and the total remaining size.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that all children are processed before the parent, maintaining the post-order traversal.

4. **Post-Order Traversal**
   - `func_1` uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal.
   - It maintains two dictionaries: `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - These dictionaries are updated correctly to reflect the number of good components and the total size of the subtrees that meet the condition.

#### Potential Issues
- **Tree Class Implementation**: The `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`) are assumed to be correct.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle edge cases, but the logic should work for valid trees.
- **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is correct, and it relies on the correctness of `func_3`, which in turn relies on `func_1`.

#### Conclusion
Given that the provided functions are logically sound and the binary search approach is correct, assuming the `Tree` class and methods are implemented correctly, the program should work as intended.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
