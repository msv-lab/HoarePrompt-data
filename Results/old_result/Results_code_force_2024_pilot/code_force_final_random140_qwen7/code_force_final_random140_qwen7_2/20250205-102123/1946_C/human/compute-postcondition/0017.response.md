To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions and the current values of the variables involved.

The loop condition is `beg < end`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `beg < end` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `beg`, `n`, `end`, and `mid` are such that:
  - If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true, then:
    - `beg` is `mid`
    - `n` is greater than 1
    - `end` is `n`
    - `mid` is updated to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`
  - Otherwise:
    - `beg` is `mid`
    - `n` is greater than 1
    - `end` is `mid - 1`
    - `mid` is greater than 2 and is updated to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`

Let's analyze the two cases:

1. **If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true:**
   - `beg` remains `mid`
   - `end` becomes `n`
   - `mid` becomes `(beg + end + 1) // 2`

   To ensure `beg < end`:
   - `beg` is `mid`
   - `end` is `n`
   - Therefore, `mid < n` must hold true for the loop to continue.

2. **Otherwise (if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns false):**
   - `beg` remains `mid`
   - `end` becomes `mid - 1`
   - `mid` becomes `(beg + end + 1) // 2` and is greater than 2

   To ensure `beg < end`:
   - `beg` is `mid`
   - `end` is `mid - 1`
   - Therefore, `mid < mid - 1` cannot hold true, but since `mid > 2`, `mid` must still satisfy the condition for the loop to continue.

In both cases, the key variables affecting the loop condition `beg < end` are `beg` and `end`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `beg` and `end`.

State: **`beg` is `mid`, `end` is either `n` or `mid - 1` depending on the return value of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`**
