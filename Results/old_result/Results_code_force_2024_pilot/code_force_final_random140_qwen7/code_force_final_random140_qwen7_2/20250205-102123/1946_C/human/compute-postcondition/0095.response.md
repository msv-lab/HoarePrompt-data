Output State: The stack will contain a series of tuples (u, False), where each u is a child vertex of v, and the number of such tuples in the stack will be equal to the total number of children of v.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the stack will contain a list of all child vertices of the initial vertex v, each paired with `False`. The exact number of these tuples will be equal to the total number of direct children that vertex v has in the tree.
