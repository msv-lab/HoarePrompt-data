Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (the length of the array a) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (the array a). Each element of a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the length n is between 1 and 10^5 inclusive. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all test cases in `test_cases`. For each test case, the loop has counted the number of elements in the sorted array `a` that are equal to the median value. Specifically, `operations` for each test case is the count of such elements starting from the median index until the end of the array or until the elements are no longer equal to the median value. `median_index` is the last index where the condition `a[median_index] == median_value` holds true. `results` is a list containing the `operations` value for each test case. All other variables outside the loop remain in their initial or updated states as described in the previous iterations, with `test_cases` being fully processed and `results` holding the final counts of operations for each test case.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after processing all test cases, `results` will contain the number of trailing equal elements from the median position for each test case's sorted array. The `test_cases` variable will be empty since all test cases have been processed, and other relevant variables like `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` will reflect the final state of the last processed test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the number of trailing equal elements from the median position for each test case's sorted array. The variable `test_cases` is now an empty list since all test cases have been processed. Other relevant variables like `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` reflect the final state of the last processed test case.
