Output State: `operations` is 3, `n` is equal to the last element in `test_cases`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 3`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is not defined (it has been exhausted by the test cases).

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `median_index` and `operations` until `median_index` no longer satisfies the condition `median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value`. Given that the loop executed 3 times initially and the conditions provided indicate that `n` must increase with each iteration, the loop will eventually terminate when `median_index` no longer meets the condition or `n` runs out of elements. Since the loop executed 3 times initially and there were no further increments or changes to the conditions provided, it implies that the loop did not execute any additional times beyond the initial 3 iterations. Therefore, `operations` remains at 3, and `n` becomes the last element in `test_cases`. The other variables (`a`, `median_value`, `results`, and `case`) retain their states as described after the third iteration.
