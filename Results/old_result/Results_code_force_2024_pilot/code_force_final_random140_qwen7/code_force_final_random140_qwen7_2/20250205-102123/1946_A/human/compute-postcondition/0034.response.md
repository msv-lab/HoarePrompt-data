Output State: `median_index` is incremented to a value that is equal to or just below `n`, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the sorted second element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `median_value` is now `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is incremented to a value that is 3 more than its initial value (which is 1), `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the final value of `operations`, and `median_index` is no longer less than `n`.

This means that the loop has completed all its iterations, incrementing `median_index` and `operations` until `median_index` is no longer less than `n` or `a[median_index]` is no longer equal to `median_value`. The final values of `median_index` and `operations` reflect the total number of increments performed during the loop's execution.
