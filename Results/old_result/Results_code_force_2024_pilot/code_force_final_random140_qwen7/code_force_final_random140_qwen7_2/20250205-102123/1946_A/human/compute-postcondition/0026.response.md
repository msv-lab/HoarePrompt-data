Output State: **`median_index` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the sorted second element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `median_value` is now `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is 0, `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`, and `n` must be greater than `median_index`.**

This means that the `median_index` variable has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values or conditions. The value of `n` and `a` remain as they were from the second test case in `test_cases`, and `median_value` is recalculated based on the updated `n` and `a`. The `operations` and `results` variables also remain unchanged.
