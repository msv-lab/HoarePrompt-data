Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least two test cases; `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the second test case in `test_cases`; `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is the total number of times the loop has executed plus 1; `median_index` is the last index where `a[median_index]` was found to be equal to `median_value` and `median_index` is either equal to `n` or `a[median_index]` is no longer equal to `median_value`; `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`, and `n, a` are assigned the values from the second test case.**

In this output state, the variables `n` and `a` are updated to reflect the first and second elements (respectively) of the second test case in `test_cases`. All other variables retain their previous conditions.
