You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (the length of the array a) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (the array a). Each element of a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the length n is between 1 and 10^5 inclusive. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, a = case
        
        a.sort()
        
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        
        median_value = a[median_index]
        
        operations = 0
        
        while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
            median_index += 1
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all test cases in `test_cases`. For each test case, the loop has counted the number of elements in the sorted array `a` that are equal to the median value. Specifically, `operations` for each test case is the count of such elements starting from the median index until the end of the array or until the elements are no longer equal to the median value. `median_index` is the last index where the condition `a[median_index] == median_value` holds true. `results` is a list containing the `operations` value for each test case. All other variables outside the loop remain in their initial or updated states as described in the previous iterations, with `test_cases` being fully processed and `results` holding the final counts of operations for each test case.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after processing all test cases, `results` will contain the number of trailing equal elements from the median position for each test case's sorted array. The `test_cases` variable will be empty since all test cases have been processed, and other relevant variables like `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` will reflect the final state of the last processed test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the number of trailing equal elements from the median position for each test case's sorted array. The variable `test_cases` is now an empty list since all test cases have been processed. Other relevant variables like `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` reflect the final state of the last processed test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the array `a`, finds the median value and its index, and then counts the number of trailing equal elements from the median position. The function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case. After processing all test cases, the `test_cases` list is emptied.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing the number of trailing equal elements from the median position for each test case's sorted array. The variable `test_cases` is now an empty list since all test cases have been processed. Other relevant variables like `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` reflect the final state of the last processed test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
