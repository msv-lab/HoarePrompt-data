Output State: **`operations` is 1, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `operations` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `operations` is now 1, while `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median_value`, `results`, and `case` retain their original values.
