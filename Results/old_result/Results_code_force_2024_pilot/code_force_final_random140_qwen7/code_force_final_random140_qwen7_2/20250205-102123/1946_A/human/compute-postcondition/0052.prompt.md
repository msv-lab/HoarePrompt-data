Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operations` is 0, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
    median_index += 1
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `operations` is 1, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `operations` is 2, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases` and must be incremented by at least 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 2`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `operations` is 3, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases` and must be greater than the next element in `test_cases` by at least 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 3`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
