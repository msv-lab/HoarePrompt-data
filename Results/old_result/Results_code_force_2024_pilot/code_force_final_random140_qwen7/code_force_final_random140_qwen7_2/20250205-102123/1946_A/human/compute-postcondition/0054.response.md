Output State: **`operations` is 3, `n` is the last element in `test_cases`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 3`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains 3, `case` is not defined.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `operations` (which is 3) to the list `results`. Since the loop did not execute any additional times beyond the initial 3 iterations, `operations` remains unchanged at 3. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median_value`, and `case`) retain their states as described after the third iteration.
