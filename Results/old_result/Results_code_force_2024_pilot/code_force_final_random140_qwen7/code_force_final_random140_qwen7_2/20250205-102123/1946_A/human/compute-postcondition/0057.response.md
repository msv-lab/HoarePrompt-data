Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing the number of trailing equal elements from the median position for each test case's sorted array. The variable `test_cases` is now an empty list since all test cases have been processed. Other relevant variables like `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` reflect the final state of the last processed test case.**

This means that after processing all test cases, the `results` list contains the count of elements that are equal to the median value starting from the median index until the end of the array or until the elements are no longer equal to the median value for each test case. The `test_cases` list is now empty as all test cases have been processed. Variables `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` hold their final values from the last processed test case.
