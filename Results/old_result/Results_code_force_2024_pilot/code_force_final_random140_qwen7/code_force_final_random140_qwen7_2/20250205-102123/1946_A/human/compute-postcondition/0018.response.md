Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is the total number of times the loop has executed; `median_index` is the last index where `a[median_index]` was found to be equal to `median_value` and `median_index` is either equal to `n` or `a[median_index]` is no longer equal to `median_value`; `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(operations)` appends the current value of `operations` to the list `results`. This does not change the values of any other variables but adds the current `operations` value to the `results` list. Therefore, the `results` list now contains one more element, which is the current value of `operations`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
