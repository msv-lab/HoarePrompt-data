Output State: **`operations` is 3, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases` and must be greater than the next element in `test_cases` by at least 1, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 3`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index - 1]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The variable `operations` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
