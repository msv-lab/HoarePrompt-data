Output State: **`operations` is 0, `n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index]`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `operations` to 0. This does not affect any other variables from the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median_value`, `results`, and `case` remain unchanged from their initial states.
