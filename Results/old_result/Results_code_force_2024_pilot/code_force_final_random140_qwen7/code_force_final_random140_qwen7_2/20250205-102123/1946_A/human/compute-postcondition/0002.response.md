Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`.**

This output state reflects that the first test case from `test_cases` has been unpacked into two variables: `n` and `a`. The rest of the `test_cases` remain unchanged.
