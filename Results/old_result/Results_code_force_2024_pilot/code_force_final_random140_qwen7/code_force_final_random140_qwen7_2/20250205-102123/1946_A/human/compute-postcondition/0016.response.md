Output State: `test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is the total number of times the loop has executed; `median_index` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `median_index` is less than `n` and the element at `median_index` in array `a` is equal to `median_value`. After all iterations, the condition `median_index < n` will no longer be true (i.e., `median_index` will be equal to `n`), and the loop will terminate. At this point, `operations` will hold the total number of times the loop has executed, and `median_index` will be set to `n`.
