Output State: The loop has executed for all test cases in `test_cases`. For each test case, the loop has counted the number of elements in the sorted array `a` that are equal to the median value. Specifically, `operations` for each test case is the count of such elements starting from the median index until the end of the array or until the elements are no longer equal to the median value. `median_index` is the last index where the condition `a[median_index] == median_value` holds true. `results` is a list containing the `operations` value for each test case. All other variables outside the loop remain in their initial or updated states as described in the previous iterations, with `test_cases` being fully processed and `results` holding the final counts of operations for each test case.

In simpler terms, after processing all test cases, `results` will contain the number of trailing equal elements from the median position for each test case's sorted array. The `test_cases` variable will be empty since all test cases have been processed, and other relevant variables like `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` will reflect the final state of the last processed test case.
