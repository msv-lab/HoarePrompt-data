Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes the test cases into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the length of the array and the array itself.
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case individually:
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calculates the median index.
   - It determines the median value.
   - It counts the number of trailing elements from the median position that are equal to the median value.
3. The function returns a list of these counts for each test case.
4. The logic for counting trailing equal elements from the median position is correct. If there are multiple elements equal to the median value starting from the median index, the function correctly counts them.
5. The program does not modify any variables outside the scope of the function, ensuring that the state of the `test_cases` list remains unchanged after the function call.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
