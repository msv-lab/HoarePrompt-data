Output State: **`operations` is incremented by 1; `median_index` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`; `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`.**

This means that the `operations` variable has been incremented by 1, while the other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
