#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (the length of the array a) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (the array a). Each element of a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the length n is between 1 and 10^5 inclusive. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, a = case
        
        a.sort()
        
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        
        median_value = a[median_index]
        
        operations = 0
        
        while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
            median_index += 1
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all test cases in `test_cases`. For each test case, the loop has counted the number of elements in the sorted array `a` that are equal to the median value. Specifically, `operations` for each test case is the count of such elements starting from the median index until the end of the array or until the elements are no longer equal to the median value. `median_index` is the last index where the condition `a[median_index] == median_value` holds true. `results` is a list containing the `operations` value for each test case. All other variables outside the loop remain in their initial or updated states as described in the previous iterations, with `test_cases` being fully processed and `results` holding the final counts of operations for each test case.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after processing all test cases, `results` will contain the number of trailing equal elements from the median position for each test case's sorted array. The `test_cases` variable will be empty since all test cases have been processed, and other relevant variables like `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` will reflect the final state of the last processed test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the number of trailing equal elements from the median position for each test case's sorted array. The variable `test_cases` is now an empty list since all test cases have been processed. Other relevant variables like `n`, `a`, `median_value`, and `median_index` reflect the final state of the last processed test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It sorts each list `a`, finds the median value and its index, and counts the number of trailing elements from the median position that are equal to the median value. The function returns a list of these counts for each test case. After processing all test cases, the `test_cases` list is emptied, and all other relevant variables reflect the final state of the last processed test case.
