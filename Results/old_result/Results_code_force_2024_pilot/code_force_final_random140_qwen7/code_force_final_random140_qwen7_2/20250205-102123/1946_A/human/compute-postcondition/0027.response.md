Output State: **`median_index` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the sorted second element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `median_value` is now `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is 1, `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the value of `operations`, and `n` must be greater than `median_index`.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Initially, `operations` was 0, so after executing this line, `operations` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
