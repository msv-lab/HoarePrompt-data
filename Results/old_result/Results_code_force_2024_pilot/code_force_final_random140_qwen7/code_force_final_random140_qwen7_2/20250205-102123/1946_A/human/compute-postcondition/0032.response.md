Output State: **`operations` is incremented by 1, `median_index` is incremented by 2, `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`, `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`, and `median_index` must be less than `n`**.

This means that the `median_index` has been incremented by 1 (from its previous value), resulting in it being incremented by 2 in total. All other conditions and relationships remain the same.
