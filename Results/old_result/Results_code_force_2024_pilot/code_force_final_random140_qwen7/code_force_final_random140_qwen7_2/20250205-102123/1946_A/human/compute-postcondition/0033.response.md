Output State: **`operations` is incremented by 1, `median_index` is incremented by 2, `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`, `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`, and `median_index` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
