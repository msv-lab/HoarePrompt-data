test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (the length of the array a) and a list of integers a (the array a). For each test case, 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 10^5, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
