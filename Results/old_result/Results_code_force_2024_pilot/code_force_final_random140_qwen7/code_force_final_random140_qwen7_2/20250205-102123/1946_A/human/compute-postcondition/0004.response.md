Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**

This means that the `median_index` variable is now calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`, where `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
