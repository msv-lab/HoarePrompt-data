Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (the length of the array a) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (the array a). Each element of a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the length n is between 1 and 10^5 inclusive. The length of `results` is 0, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

In this step, the code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the `test_cases` list or any of its elements. Therefore, the `test_cases` list remains unchanged, and the `results` list is initialized as an empty list.
