Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `case` from the `test_cases` list. This means the variables that can be adjusted are `case` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `test_cases` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `median_index` is 3 more than its initial value.
   - `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`.
   - `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`.
   - `median_index` is less than `n`.
   - `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, the variable `case` will be the next element in `test_cases`.
   - The condition `n > median_index + 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.
   - `median_index` will remain the same unless the loop body changes it.
   - `results` will increment by the number of operations performed in the current iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next `case` in the `test_cases` list while maintaining the other conditions.

**State:**
- `median_index` is 3 more than its initial value.
- `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`.
- `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`.
- `median_index` is less than `n`.
- `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration.
- `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.

So, the final state is:
**`median_index` is 3 more than its initial value, `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`, `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`, `median_index` is less than `n`, `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations, and `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.**
