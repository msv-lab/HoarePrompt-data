### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array by performing operations that increment any element by 1.
   - The provided code reads the input, sorts the array, and calculates the median index.
   - However, the logic for counting the number of operations is flawed.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It sorts the array and determines the median index.
   - The median value is correctly identified.
   - The loop counts the number of consecutive elements that are equal to the median value, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted correctly.
   - **Finding the Median Index**: The median index calculation is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - **Counting Operations**: The current implementation is incorrect because it simply counts the number of consecutive elements equal to the median value instead of finding the smallest value greater than the median value and incrementing the median value to that value.

4. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The current implementation increments the operations counter for each consecutive occurrence of the median value, which is not the correct approach.
   - To find the minimum number of operations, we need to determine the smallest value greater than the current median value and increment the median value to that value.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - We need to find the smallest value greater than the current median value.
   - Increment the median value to that value.
   - The number of operations needed will be the difference between the new median value and the old median value.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The loop in the `func_1` function counts the number of consecutive elements equal to the median value, which is not the correct approach.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
