Output State: **`n` is equal to the next element in `test_cases`; `a` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`; `median_value` is equal to `a[median_index]`; `results` contains the count of operations performed during the loop iterations plus the operations performed in the current iteration; `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The line `median_value = a[median_index]` updates the value of `median_value` to be the element at index `median_index` in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
