The code increments the value of `median_index` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `median_index` was less than `n` and `a[median_index]` was equal to `median_value`. Since `median_value` is defined as `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, and `a` is sorted, the new value of `median_index` will be `median_index + 1`, which is still less than `n` because `median_index` was originally less than `n`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one test case; `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the sorted second element of the first test case in `test_cases`; `a[0]` must be equal to `median_value`; `median_value` is the element at index `(n - 1) // 2` in `a`; `operations` is 2; `median_index` is now `median_index + 1` and is still less than `n` and `a[median_index]` is equal to `median_value`.**
