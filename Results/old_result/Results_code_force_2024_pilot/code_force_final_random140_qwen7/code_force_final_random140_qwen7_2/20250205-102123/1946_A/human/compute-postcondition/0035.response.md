Output State: `median_index` is incremented by 3, `n` must be greater than `median_index + 1`, `a[median_index + 1]` must be equal to `median_value`, and `median_index` is less than `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `median_index` will be incremented by 3 compared to its initial state after the third iteration. The condition for the loop to continue (`median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value`) will still hold true, meaning `median_index` is less than `n` and the element at `median_index + 1` is equal to `median_value`. The `operations` counter will have been incremented multiple times, but the exact number depends on how many times the loop iterated, which is determined by the values of `n` and `median_value`.
