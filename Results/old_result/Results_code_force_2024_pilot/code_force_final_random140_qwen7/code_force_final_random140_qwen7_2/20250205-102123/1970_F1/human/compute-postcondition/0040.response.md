Output State: **`line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is `ind + 2`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` sets the value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
