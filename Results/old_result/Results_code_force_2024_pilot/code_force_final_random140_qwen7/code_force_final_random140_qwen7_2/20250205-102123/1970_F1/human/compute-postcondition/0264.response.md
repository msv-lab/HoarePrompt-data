Functionality: **The function reads a game field configuration and a series of commands from standard input. It updates the game state based on these commands, including moving players and objects, updating scores when a golden snitch is caught or a goal is scored, and handling player eliminations. Finally, it prints the final scores of the red and blue teams.**
