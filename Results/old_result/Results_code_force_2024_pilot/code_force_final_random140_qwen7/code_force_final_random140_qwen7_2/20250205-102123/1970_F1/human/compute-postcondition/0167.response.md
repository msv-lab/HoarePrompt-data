Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `player` is the value of `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise it is the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
   - `command` is the list of strings obtained from the standard input.
   - `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`).

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `time` is explicitly stated to be 0.
   - `player` depends on the value of `obj` and the contents of the `grid` at the position determined by `nxt`.

Given these details, let's determine the value of `player`:
- If `obj` is a player, then `player` is simply the value of `obj`.
- If `obj` is not a player, then `player` is the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, where `nxt` is calculated based on the movement rules specified by `mov[com][0]` and `mov[com][1]`.

Since the exact value of `obj` and the contents of `grid` are not provided, we can only describe `player` in terms of the conditions given.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output `0` followed by the value of `player` and the word "ELIMINATED".

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **0 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is the value of obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is the value of grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**
