Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `obj` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list (same as `obj`).
   - `el` is the third element of the `command` list.
   - `comand` is equal to `command`.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `time` is explicitly given as 2.
- `player` depends on the value of `obj` and the result of `isPlayer(obj)`. Since the exact value of `obj` and the function `isPlayer(obj)` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `player`. However, we know that `player` will either be `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if it returns False.

Since the exact value of `player` cannot be determined without additional information about `obj` and the `isPlayer` function, we will represent it symbolically.

**Output:**
Output: **2 [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is either obj if isPlayer(obj) returns True, or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] if isPlayer(obj) returns False)**
