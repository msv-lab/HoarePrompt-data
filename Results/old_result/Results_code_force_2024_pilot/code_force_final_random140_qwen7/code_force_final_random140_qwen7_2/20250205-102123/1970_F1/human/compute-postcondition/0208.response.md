Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `obj` is the second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nxt` by calculating the new position based on the current position `pos` and the movement vector `mov[com]`. The values of `t`, `time`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, `comand`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial states.
