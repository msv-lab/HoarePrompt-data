Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, which results in the opposing team scoring a point. According to the problem description, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the other team wins the point. However, the `func_1` function does not account for this case. Specifically, the function checks if the Quaffle is thrown into a goal using the `goalIn` function, but it does not handle the case where the Quaffle is thrown into the player's own goal. Here is an example to illustrate this issue:

### Example Input:
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T
```

### Expected Output:
```
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

### Actual Output:
```
6 RED GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 2 0
```

In this example, the red player throws the Quaffle into the red goal, which should result in the blue team scoring a point. However, the program incorrectly increments the red team's score instead of the blue team's score. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal.
