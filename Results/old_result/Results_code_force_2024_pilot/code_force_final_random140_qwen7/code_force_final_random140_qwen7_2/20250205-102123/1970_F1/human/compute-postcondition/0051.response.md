Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as before the loop started, `elements[line[ind]]` is set for each non-'..' element, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `goal[tmp]` is updated if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`. The new variable `line` is created and holds the result of this operation.
