Output State: **`ind` is 2; `line` is a string with at least one character, the character at index 0 of `line` is not ".."; `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, if `line[2]` is not "..", `elements[line[2]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`; if `isPlayer(line[2])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[2]]` is `False`; if `isPlayer(line[2])` returns `False`, then `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, 2)` if the character at index 1 of `line[2]` is 'G'.**

Explanation:
- `ind` remains 2.
- `line` remains a string with at least one character, and the character at index 0 of `line` is not "..".
- `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`.
- If `line[2]` is not "..", `elements[line[2]]` is updated to be `(i, 2)`.
- `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
- If `isPlayer(line[2])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[2]]` is also set to `False`.
- If `isPlayer(line[2])` returns `False`, then `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, 2)` if the character at index 1 of `line[2]` is 'G'.
