Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input, stripping whitespace, and splitting by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input from standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings based on spaces. The original values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `line` is created and holds the resulting list of strings.
