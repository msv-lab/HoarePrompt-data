Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is either 1 or 2, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`. Additionally, if `len(comand) == 3` and `el` equals '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` equals '.S', `team` is determined as 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(comand) != 3`, `time` is set to 2, `obj` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `nxt` is defined as `elements[obj]` (if the condition `obj == '.B'` is true, otherwise `nxt` remains undefined), `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and `points[team]` is 1 more than its original value if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1 and `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
