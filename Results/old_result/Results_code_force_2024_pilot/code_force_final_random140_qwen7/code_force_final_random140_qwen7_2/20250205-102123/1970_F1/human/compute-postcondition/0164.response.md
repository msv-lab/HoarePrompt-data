Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`).**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nxt` by calculating a new position based on the current position `pos` and the movement specified in the dictionary `mov` corresponding to the command `com`. The initial values of `t`, `time`, `command`, `obj`, `com`, and `pos` remain unchanged.
