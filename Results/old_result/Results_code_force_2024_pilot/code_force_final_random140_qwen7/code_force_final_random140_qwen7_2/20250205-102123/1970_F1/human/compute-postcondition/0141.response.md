Output State: **`t` is the integer value read from stdin and stripped of whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(stdin.readline().strip())` reads an integer from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `t`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
