Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `obj` is the second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `pos` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `nxt` is defined as `elements[obj]`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and `points[team]` is 1 more than its original value if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1 and `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.**

Explanation: The line `elements[obj] = nxt` assigns the value of `nxt` to `elements[obj]`. Since `nxt` was previously undefined, it is now defined as `elements[obj]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
