Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly reads the initial game setup from standard input, including the dimensions of the field, the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle. It also handles the sequence of actions and updates the game state accordingly.
2. **Function `goalIn`**: This function correctly identifies whether a given position is a goal for the red or blue team. It returns the appropriate team index (0 for red, 1 for blue) or -1 if the position is not a goal.
3. **Function `isPlayer`**: This function correctly determines if a given element is a player by checking if the first character is 'R' or 'B' and the second character is not 'G'.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the provided functions collectively handle the game logic as specified. They correctly update the game state based on the actions, check for scoring conditions, and print the appropriate events and final scores.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
