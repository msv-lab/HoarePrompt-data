Postcondition: `ind` is 1, `line` is a string with at least one character, and the character at index 0 of `line` is not '..', `elements` is updated such that the element at index `line[ind]` is assigned the value `i`. Furthermore, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, then the function returns, and if the character at index 1 of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`.
