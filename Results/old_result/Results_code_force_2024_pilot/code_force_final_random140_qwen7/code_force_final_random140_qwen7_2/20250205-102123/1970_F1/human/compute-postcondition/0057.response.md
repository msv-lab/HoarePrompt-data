Postcondition: `ind` is `n-1`, `n` must be such that `n-1` is less than `len(line)`, `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the value `i`, `ind` remains unchanged, and the function `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`.
