Output State: **`ind` is now `i`, `line[ind]` is the element at index `i` in `line`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, ind)`, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned to `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The line `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` sets the value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
