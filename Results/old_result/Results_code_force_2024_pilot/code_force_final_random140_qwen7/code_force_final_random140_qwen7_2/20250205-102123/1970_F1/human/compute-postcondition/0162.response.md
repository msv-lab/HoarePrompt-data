Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list.**

Explanation: The code `obj, com = comand` unpacks the tuple `comand` into two variables `obj` and `com`. Since `comand` is derived from `command` (which is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split), `obj` will be set to the first element of `command` and `com` will be set to the second element of `command`. The other variables (`t`, `time`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
