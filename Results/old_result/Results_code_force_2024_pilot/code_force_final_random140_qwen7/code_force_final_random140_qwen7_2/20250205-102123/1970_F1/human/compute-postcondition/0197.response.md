Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`.**

Explanation: The code simply unpacks the elements of the `comand` list into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. These variables now hold the first, second, and third elements of the `comand` list, respectively. The values of `t`, `time`, and `command` remain unchanged.
