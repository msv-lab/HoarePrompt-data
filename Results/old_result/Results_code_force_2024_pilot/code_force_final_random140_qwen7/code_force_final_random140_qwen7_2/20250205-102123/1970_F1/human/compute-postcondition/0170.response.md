Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). `com` is currently 'T', `obj` is not equal to '.B' or `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and `isPlayer(obj)` is False or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.**
