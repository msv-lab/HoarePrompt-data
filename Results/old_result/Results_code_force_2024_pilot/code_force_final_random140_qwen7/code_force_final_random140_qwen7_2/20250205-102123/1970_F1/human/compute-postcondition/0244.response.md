Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 3, `obj` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `allPlayers[obj]` is False.**

The code `allPlayers[obj] = False` sets the value of `allPlayers[obj]` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
