Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `ind` and the object `line`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for ind in range(len(line)):` will execute as long as `len(line)` is at least 1. This means there must be at least one element in the list `line`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `ind` will take on values from `0` to `len(line) - 1` during the loop iterations. We don't need to specify its initial value since it will be set by the loop itself.
   - The list `line` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `line` must have at least one string in it.
- `ind` will be set by the loop and doesn't need an initial value specified here.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`line` is a list of strings that must have at least one string, `ind` is set by the loop**.
