Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split.
   - `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `el` is the third element of the `command` list.
   - `comand` is equal to `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', else `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `time` is explicitly given as 1.
- `team` is determined by the value of `obj[0]`. Since `obj[0]` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact value of `team` without knowing the input. However, `team` will either be 0 or 1.
- `GoalName` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. But it will be indexed by `team`, which means `GoalName[team]` will be either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`.

Given these points, the print statement will output a string with `time` set to 1 and `GoalName[team]` set to either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`.

Output: **1 GoalName[team]**
