Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - All iterations of the loop have been executed.
   - The variable `i` has been incremented for each iteration of the loop.
   - `ind` has been set to `len(line) - 1` by the end of the loop.
   - For each non-'..' element in `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
   - If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is determined based on `line[ind][0]`, and `goal[tmp]` appends `(i, ind)`.

2. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - Since all iterations have been executed, `i` must be equal to `n-1` (because it starts from 0 and increments until it reaches `n-1`).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop has already completed all its iterations, `i` cannot be incremented further.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop; it remains the same as it was before the loop started.

5. **Final State**:
   - There are no changes needed for the loop to execute one more time because it has already completed all its iterations.

Given this analysis, the final state remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as before the loop started, `elements[line[ind]]` is set for each non-'..' element, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `goal[tmp]` is updated if `line[ind][1]` is 'G'**
