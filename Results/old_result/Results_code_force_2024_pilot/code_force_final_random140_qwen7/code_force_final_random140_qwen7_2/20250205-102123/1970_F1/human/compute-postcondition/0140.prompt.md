Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `grid` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd, `elements` is a dictionary mapping entities on the field to their coordinates with the key '.B' mapped to the coordinates (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is now [[], []], `points` is [0, 0]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The variable `i` has been incremented for each iteration of the loop, and `ind` has been set to `len(line) - 1` by the end of the loop. For each non-'..' element in `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is determined based on `line[ind][0]`, and `goal[tmp]` appends `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `ind` will be `0`, `line[ind]` will be the first element in the list `line`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` will be `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, otherwise `tmp` will be 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` will include all tuples `(i, ind)` where `line[ind][1]` is 'G', and `elements[line[ind]]` will be assigned to `(i, ind)`, and `tmp` will be 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, else `tmp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ind` will be equal to the length of `line` minus one, `line` is a string with at least one character, and the character at index 0 of `line` is not "..". The variable `elements` will contain key-value pairs where each key is a non- ".." character from `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`, with `i` being the current iteration index and `ind` being the index of the character in `line`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` will be `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `goal[tmp]` will contain tuples `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `line[ind][1]` is 'G'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
