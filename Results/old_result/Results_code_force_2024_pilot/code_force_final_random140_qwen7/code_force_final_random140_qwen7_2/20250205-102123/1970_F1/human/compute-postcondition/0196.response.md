Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`.**

Explanation: The code `comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()` reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `comand`. However, the original values of `t`, `time`, `command`, `obj`, `com`, and `el` remain unchanged. The new variable `comand` is created and assigned the value of `command`.
