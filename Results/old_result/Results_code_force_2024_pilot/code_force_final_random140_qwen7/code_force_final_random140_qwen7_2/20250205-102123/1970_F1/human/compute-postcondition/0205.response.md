Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`. Furthermore, if `el` equals '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` equals '.S', `team` is determined as 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10.
