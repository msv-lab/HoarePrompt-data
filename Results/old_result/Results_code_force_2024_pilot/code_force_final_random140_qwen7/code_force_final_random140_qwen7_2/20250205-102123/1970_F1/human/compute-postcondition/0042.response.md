Output State: **`line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is `ind + 2`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, ind)`**.

This means that the list `line` and its index `ind` have been updated according to the initial conditions. The value of `ind` is now `ind + 2`. The element at the updated index `ind` in the list `line` has been used to set `elements[line[ind]]` to the tuple `(i, ind)`. The boolean value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`. The variable `tmp` is set to `0` if the first character of `line[ind]` is `'B'`, otherwise it is set to `1`. Finally, the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to the list `goal[tmp]`.
