Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `obj` is the second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` + the movement specified by `mov[com][0]` and `mov[com][1]`, `nxt` is undefined, `elements[obj]` is now `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `elements[obj]` to the new position `nxt`. Since `nxt` is defined as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, this new value is assigned to `elements[obj]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
