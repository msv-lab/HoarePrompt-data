Output State: **`ind` is `n-1`, `n` must be such that `n-1` is less than `len(line)`, `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings, the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the value `i`, `ind` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is 0**.

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B'. Since the precondition states that the first character of `line[ind]` is 'G', the condition `line[ind][0] == 'B'` is false. Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the value 1 (using the else part of the ternary operator). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
