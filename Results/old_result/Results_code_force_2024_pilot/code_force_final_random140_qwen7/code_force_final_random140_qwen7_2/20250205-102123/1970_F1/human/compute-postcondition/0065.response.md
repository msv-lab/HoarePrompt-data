Output State: **`ind` is `n-1`, `n` must be such that `n-1` is less than `len(line)`, `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings, the current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the value `i`, `ind` remains unchanged, `tmp` is 0, `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`**.

This means that the variable `tmp` was 0, and `goal[0]` (since `tmp` is 0) has now appended the tuple `(i, ind)` to its list. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
