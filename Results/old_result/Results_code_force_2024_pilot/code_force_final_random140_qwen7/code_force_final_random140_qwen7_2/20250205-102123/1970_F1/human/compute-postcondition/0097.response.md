Output State: **`grid` is a list containing one element which is the list of strings obtained by splitting the first line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `grid.append(line)` appends the `line` (which is a list of strings obtained by splitting the first line read from standard input) to the `grid` list. Since `grid` was initially empty, after executing this line, `grid` will contain only the `line` list as its first and only element.
