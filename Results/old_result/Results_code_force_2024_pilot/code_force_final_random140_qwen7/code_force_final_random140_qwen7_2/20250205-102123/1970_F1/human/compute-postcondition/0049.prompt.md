Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0; `n` must be at least 1; `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input, stripping whitespace, and splitting by spaces; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is set by the loop, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'. If `line[ind]` is not '..', the following changes occur:
- `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`.
- If `isPlayer(line[ind])` evaluates to `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
- If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `line[ind][1]` is checked. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', no additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` has either one element or two identical elements `(i, ind)` depending on whether `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is `ind + 2`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` is either set to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][1]` is `'G'` or remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
