Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 3, `obj` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`**.

Explanation: The code `obj, com = comand` unpacks the `comand` list into two variables `obj` and `com`. Since `comand` is equal to `command`, `obj` and `com` now hold the second and third elements of the `command` list, respectively. The values of `t`, `time`, `el`, and `comand` remain unchanged.
