Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `ind` is `n-1`
   - `n` must be such that `n-1` is less than `len(line)`
   - `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each index `ind` in the range `range(len(line))`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `ind` and `line`.

4. **Postconditions After Each Iteration:**
   - If `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, then:
     - If `line[ind]` is a player and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the value `i`.
     - Otherwise, `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the value `i` and `ind` remains unchanged.
   - If `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`.
   - If `line[ind]` is `'..'`, then `ind` remains unchanged.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `ind` starts at `n-1` and the loop runs for each index in `range(len(line))`, the next `ind` value will be `n-2` (if the loop continues).
   - The condition `n-1 < len(line)` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `ind` will be `n-2` because it starts at `n-1` and decrements by 1 each iteration.
- `n` must still satisfy the condition `n-2 < len(line)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ind` is `n-2`, `n` must be such that `n-2` is less than `len(line)`**
