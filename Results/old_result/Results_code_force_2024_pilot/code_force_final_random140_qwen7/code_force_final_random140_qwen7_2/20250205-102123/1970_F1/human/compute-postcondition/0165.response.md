Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). Additionally, either `obj` is equal to `.B` and the next position `nxt` is occupied by a player, or `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is where the piece `.B` would move to.**
