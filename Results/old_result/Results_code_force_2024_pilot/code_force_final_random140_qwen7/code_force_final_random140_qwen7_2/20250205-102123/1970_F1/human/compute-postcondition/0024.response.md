Postcondition: `line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is set by the loop, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`. If the function `isPlayer(line[ind])` evaluates to `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `line[ind][1]` is checked. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', no additional changes occur.
