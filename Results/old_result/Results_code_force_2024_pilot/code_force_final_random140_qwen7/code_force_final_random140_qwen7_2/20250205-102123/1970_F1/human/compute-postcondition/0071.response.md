Postcondition: `ind` is `n-1`, `n` must be such that `n-1` is less than `len(line)`, `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings. After executing the if-else block, if `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the value `i` if `line[ind]` is a player and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, otherwise `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the value `i` and `ind` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is `'..'`, then `ind` remains unchanged.
