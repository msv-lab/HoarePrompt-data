Postcondition: `line` is a list of strings with at least one string, `ind` is `ind + 2`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` is either appended with `(i, ind)` or remains unchanged.
