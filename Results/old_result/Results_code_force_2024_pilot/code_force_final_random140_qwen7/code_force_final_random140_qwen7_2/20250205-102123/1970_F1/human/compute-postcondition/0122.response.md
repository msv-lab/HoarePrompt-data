Postcondition: `ind` is 1 if it was 0, otherwise it is 0; `line` is a string with at least one character; the character at index 0 of `line` is not ".."; `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to be `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If the character at index 0 of `line[ind]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0, otherwise `tmp` is 1. `goal[tmp]` is appended with `(i, ind)` if the character at index 1 of `line[ind]` is 'G'.
