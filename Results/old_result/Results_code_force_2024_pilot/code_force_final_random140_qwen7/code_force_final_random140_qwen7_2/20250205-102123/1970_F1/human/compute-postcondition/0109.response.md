Output State: **`ind` is 1, `line` is a string with at least one character, the character at index 0 of `line` is not '..', `elements` is updated such that the element at index `line[ind]` is assigned the value `i`, the function `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

This means that the list `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
