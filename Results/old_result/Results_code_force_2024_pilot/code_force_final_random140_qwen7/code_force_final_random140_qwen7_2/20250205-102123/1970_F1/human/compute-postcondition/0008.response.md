Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be at least 1; `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input, stripping whitespace, and splitting by spaces; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`.**

The code `grid.append(line)` appends the list `line` to the list `grid`. Since `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input, stripping whitespace, and splitting by spaces, `grid` now contains this list as its first (and only) element. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
