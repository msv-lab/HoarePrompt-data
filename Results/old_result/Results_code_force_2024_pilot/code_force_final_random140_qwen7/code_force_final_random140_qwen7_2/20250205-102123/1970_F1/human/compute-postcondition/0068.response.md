Postcondition: `ind` is `n-1`, `n` must be such that `n-1` is less than `len(line)`, `line` is the result of reading a line from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split into a list of strings. The current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the value `i` if `line[ind]` is a player and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, otherwise `elements[line[ind]]` is not assigned the value `i`. `ind` remains unchanged, and if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`.
