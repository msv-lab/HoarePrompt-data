Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the total number of iterations of the loop.
- `time` is equal to `t-1`.
- `command` is the last command read from stdin and stripped/split.
- Depending on the content of `command`:
  - If `command` includes `.Q`, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True` for the corresponding object.
  - If `command` includes `.S`, `team` is determined by checking `obj[0]` (1 if 'B', else 0), and `points[team]` is incremented by 10.
  - For other commands, if `obj` is a player and `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1.
- All objects' positions are updated according to the movement commands.

The `print` statement outputs the final scores for two teams, represented by `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

Given the information, we know that `points[0]` and `points[1]` will be incremented based on the commands processed during the loop. However, without specific commands or their frequency, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`. Therefore, we will represent them symbolically.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: points[0] points[1]**
