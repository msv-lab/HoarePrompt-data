Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value read from stdin and stripped of whitespace.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list. If `len(command) == 3` and `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. If `el` is equal to '.S', then `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0, and `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value. If `len(command) != 3`, then `obj` is not equal to '.', `isPlayer(obj)` is either `False` or `True`, `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is either `False` or `True`, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is either 1 or 2, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the standard input, stripped and split, `obj` is the first or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`. Additionally, if `el` equals '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` equals '.S', `team` is determined as 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If the `else` part is executed, `pos` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `nxt` is defined as `elements[obj]` (if the condition `obj == '.B'` is true, otherwise `nxt` remains undefined), `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and `points[team]` is 1 more than its original value if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1 and `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 3, `obj` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `com` is the second or second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to `command`. If `len(comand) == 3` and `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. Otherwise, `team` is determined based on the first character of `obj` (1 if 'B', 0 otherwise), and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(comand) != 3`, `pos` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and if `obj` is a player, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True else the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj` is not a player, `player` is `obj`. Additionally, if `com` is 'T' and `obj` is a player, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to False and `points[team]` is increased by 1 where `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `team` is not -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
