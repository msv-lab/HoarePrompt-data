Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is 3.
   - `obj` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list (same as `obj`).
   - `el` is the third element of the `command` list.
   - `comand` is equal to `command`.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

Given the above, let's determine what will be printed:

- `time` is explicitly given as 3.
- `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`. Since `pos` is the position of the player with `obj` and `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, it implies that the player is not a team member. Therefore, `team` would be determined based on the logic inside the `goalIn(pos)` function, but we don't have the exact details of this function. However, we know that `team` will be a specific team name based on the position `pos`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string in the format `3 [team_name] GOAL`, where `[team_name]` is the team name determined by the `goalIn(pos)` function.

Output: **3 [team_name] GOAL (where [team_name] is the team determined by goalIn(pos))**
