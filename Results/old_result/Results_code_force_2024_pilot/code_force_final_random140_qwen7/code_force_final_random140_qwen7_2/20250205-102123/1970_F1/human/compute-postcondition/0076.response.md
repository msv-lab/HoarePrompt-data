Output State: **`ind` is `n-2`; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. The value of `tmp` is determined by whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not. If `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. The values of `ind` and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states, but `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.
