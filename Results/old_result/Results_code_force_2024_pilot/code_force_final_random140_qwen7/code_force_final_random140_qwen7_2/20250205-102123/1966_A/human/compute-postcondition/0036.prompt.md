Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `hashmap` is a dictionary with key `i` having its value incremented by 1 or set to 1, depending on whether `i` was already present in `hashmap`, and `ans` is equal to `k - 1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least one element (one less than before), `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of key `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already present, otherwise it is set to 1, and `ans` is equal to `k - 1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is equal to `k - 1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains equal to `n`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of key `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already present, otherwise it is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
