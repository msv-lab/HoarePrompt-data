Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `ans` is `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears at least `k` times, otherwise `ans` is `n`, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `hashmap`. This does not affect the values of `arrC`, `n`, `k`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `hashmap` is created and initialized as an empty dictionary.
