Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `ans` is `n`, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `ans = n` simply assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. The values of `arrC`, `n`, `k`, and `hashmap` remain unchanged from their initial states.
