Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `arrC`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split.
   - `i` is the iterator variable that will take on the values from `arrC` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `arrC` (i.e., `arrC` is non-empty).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `arrC`, the initial value of `i` should be the first element of `arrC`.
   - The list `arrC` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `n`, `k`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
   - `hashmap` is an empty dictionary and does not affect the loop execution directly.

Based on the above reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arrC`**.
