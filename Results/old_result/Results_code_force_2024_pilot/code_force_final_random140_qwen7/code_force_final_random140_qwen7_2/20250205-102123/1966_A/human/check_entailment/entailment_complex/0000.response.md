Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to solve the problem correctly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Inputs**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of integers `arrC`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses a dictionary `hashmap` to count the occurrences of each number in `arrC`.

3. **Determining Minimum Cards**: For each number in `arrC`, if the count in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, it sets `ans` to `k - 1`. This is the key logic that determines the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the allowed operations.

4. **Outputting Results**: After processing each test case, it prints the value of `ans` and decrements `t` until it reaches 0.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases appropriately. If no number in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, `ans` remains `n`, which is the correct behavior.

Given the provided explanation and the logic within the function, the function appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
