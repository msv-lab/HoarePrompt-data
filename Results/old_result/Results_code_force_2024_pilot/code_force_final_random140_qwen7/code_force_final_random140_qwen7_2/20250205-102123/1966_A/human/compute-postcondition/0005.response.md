Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

In this code snippet, `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer from the input split, `ans` now holds the same value as `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
