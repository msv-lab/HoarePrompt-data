Postcondition: **`ans` is equal to `k - 1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains equal to `n`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of key `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already present, otherwise it is set to 1.**
