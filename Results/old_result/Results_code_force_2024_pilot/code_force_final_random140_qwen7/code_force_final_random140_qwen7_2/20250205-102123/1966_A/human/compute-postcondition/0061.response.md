Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arrC`, and `hashmap[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the `hashmap`. Here, `i` is the second element of the list `arrC`. The initial conditions of `arrC` and the value of `i` remain unchanged, but now `hashmap[i]` is set to `1`.
