Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split**.

Explanation: The variable `t` was initially assigned the value of an integer input between 1 and 500. The code then takes another input, splits it into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`, and assigns these values to `n` and `k`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the new values for `n` and `k` are derived from the second input.
