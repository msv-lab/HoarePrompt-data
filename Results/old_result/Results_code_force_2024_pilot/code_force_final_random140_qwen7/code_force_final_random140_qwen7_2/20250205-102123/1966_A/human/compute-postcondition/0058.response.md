Postcondition: `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arrC`. If `i` is in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `i` is not in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is set to 1. After executing the if-else block, if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1 (or remains unchanged if already >= k), and `ans` is `k - 1`. If `hashmap[i]` is less than `k`, then `hashmap[i]` is set to 1 (or incremented to reach at least `k` if it was previously incremented).
