Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arrC`, if `i` is in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1, if `i` is not in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is set to 1, and the value of `hashmap[i]` is now greater than or equal to `k`; `ans` is `k - 1`**.

This means that the list `arrC` and its first element `i` are unchanged, the hashmap has been updated based on the value of `i`, and the variable `ans` is now set to `k - 1`.
