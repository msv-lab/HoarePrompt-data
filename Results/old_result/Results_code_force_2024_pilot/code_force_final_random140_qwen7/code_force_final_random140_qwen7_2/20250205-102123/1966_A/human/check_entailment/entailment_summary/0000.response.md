Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `arrC`.
3. It uses a dictionary `hashmap` to count the occurrences of each number in `arrC`.
4. After counting, it checks if any number appears at least `k` times. If so, it sets `ans` to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `n`.
5. The program prints `ans` for each test case and then decrements `t` until it reaches 0.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program logic matches the requirements. It correctly calculates the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
