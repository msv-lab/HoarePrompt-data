Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is either 1 or incremented by 1 depending on whether `i` was already in `hashmap`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet increments the value of `hashmap[i]` to 1 if `i` is not already in `hashmap`. If `i` was already in `hashmap`, its value is incremented by 1. The values of `arrC` and `i` remain unchanged, and `ans` is not affected by this operation.
