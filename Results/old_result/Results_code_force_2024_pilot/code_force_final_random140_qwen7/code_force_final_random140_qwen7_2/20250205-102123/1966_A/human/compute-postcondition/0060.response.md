Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arrC`, and `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the value `i` (which is the second element of `arrC`) in the `hashmap`. Since `i` was previously just an element of `arrC`, its value in `hashmap` is now increased by 1. All other variables and the list `arrC` remain unchanged.
