Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` will be a list of integers that has been fully processed, and `ans` will be `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears at least `k` times, otherwise `ans` will be `n`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `arrC`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is determined based on the condition involving `arrC` after this line of code, but since `arrC` is not modified here, its state remains as described in the initial state.
