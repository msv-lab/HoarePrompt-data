Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `hashmap` is a dictionary with key `i` and value `1`, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `i` is in `hashmap`.**

The code `hashmap[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `hashmap`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
