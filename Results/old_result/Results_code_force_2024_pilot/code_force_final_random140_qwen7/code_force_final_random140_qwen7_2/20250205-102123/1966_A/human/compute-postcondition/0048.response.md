Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arrC`, and `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `i` (which was the first element of `arrC`) in the `hashmap` dictionary is incremented by 1. All other elements and conditions remain unchanged.
