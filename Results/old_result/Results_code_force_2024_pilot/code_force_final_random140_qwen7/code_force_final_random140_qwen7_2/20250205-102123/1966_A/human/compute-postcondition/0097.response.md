Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `arrC`, and `hashmap`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `arrC`.

3. **Determine the state changes inside the loop**:
   - For each `i` in `arrC`, if `i` is already in `hashmap`, its value is incremented by 1.
   - If `i` is not in `hashmap`, it is added to `hashmap` with the value `1`.
   - The value of `hashmap[i]` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is `k - 1`
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element
   - `hashmap` is a dictionary

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `arrC`, the next element `i` will be processed.
   - If `i` is already in `hashmap`, its value will be incremented by 1.
   - If `i` is not in `hashmap`, it will be added with the value `1`.
   - The value of `hashmap[i]` must remain greater than or equal to `k`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are related to the current element `i` being processed and the `hashmap`.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `ans` remains `k - 1` (since `ans` is not directly affected by the loop)
- `t` remains greater than 0 (since `t` is not directly affected by the loop)
- `n` remains the same (since `n` is not directly affected by the loop)
- `k` remains the same (since `k` is not directly affected by the loop)
- `arrC` remains the same (since `arrC` is not directly affected by the loop)
- `hashmap` will have the updated values based on the current `i`

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` for the next iteration, we can only say that the next `i` will be processed, and its value in `hashmap` will be updated accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element, and `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the next `i` in `arrC` will be incremented by 1 if it exists, or added with the value `1` if it does not exist, and the value will be greater than or equal to `k`.**
