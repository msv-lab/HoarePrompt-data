Output State: **`ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the next `i` in `arrC` will be incremented by 1 if it exists, or added with the value `1` if it does not exist, and now the value of `hashmap[i]` is `1`.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been set to `1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
