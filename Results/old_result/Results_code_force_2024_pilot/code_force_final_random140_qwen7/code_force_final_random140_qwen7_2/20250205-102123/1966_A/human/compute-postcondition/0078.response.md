The loop condition for the given `while` loop is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is decreased by 1.
- `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split.
- `n` is the original length of `arrC`.
- `k` retains its original value.
- `hashmap` contains counts of each integer in `arrC`.
- `ans` is `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times; otherwise, `ans` remains `n` (the original value of `ans`).

To ensure that `t > 0` for the next iteration, `t` must be adjusted such that it is still greater than 0. Since `t` was decreased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
