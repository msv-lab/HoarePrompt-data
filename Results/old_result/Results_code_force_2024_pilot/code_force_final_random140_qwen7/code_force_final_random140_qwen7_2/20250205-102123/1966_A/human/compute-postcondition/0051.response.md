Output State: **`arrC` is a list of integers from the input split with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arrC`, and `i` is not in `hashmap`; `hashmap[i]` is set to 1.**

This means that the value of `i` (which was previously not in `hashmap`) is now associated with the value `1` in the `hashmap`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
