Postcondition: **`ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element, and `hashmap` is a dictionary. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, then the value of `i` in `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, then `i` is added to `hashmap` with the value `1`. Additionally, the value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
