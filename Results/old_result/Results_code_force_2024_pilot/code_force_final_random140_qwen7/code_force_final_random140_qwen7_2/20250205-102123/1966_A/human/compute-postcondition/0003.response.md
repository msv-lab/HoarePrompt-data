Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `arrC`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
