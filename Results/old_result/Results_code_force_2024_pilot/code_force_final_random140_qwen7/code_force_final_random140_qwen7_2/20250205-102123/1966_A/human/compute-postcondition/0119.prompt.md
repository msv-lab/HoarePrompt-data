You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; the list of integers c represents the numbers written on the cards, where each c_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        hashmap = {}
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in arrC:
            if i in hashmap:
                hashmap[i] += 1
            else:
                hashmap[i] = 1
            if hashmap[i] >= k:
                ans = k - 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be `0`, `n` will be an integer from the last input split, `k` will be an integer from the last input split, `arrC` will be a list of integers from the last input split, and `ans` will be `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears at least `k` times; otherwise, `ans` will be `n`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `t` will have reached `0` because it is decremented by `1` in each iteration. The final values of `n`, `k`, and `arrC` will correspond to the inputs provided in the last iteration of the loop. The variable `ans` will hold the value `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` was found to appear `k` or more times during the processing of `arrC`. If no such element was found, `ans` will retain its original value `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, k, and a list c, where t is an integer between 1 and 500, n and k are integers between 1 and 100 with k being at least 2, and c is a list of integers between 1 and 100. The function returns a value based on specific conditions involving these variables and list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
