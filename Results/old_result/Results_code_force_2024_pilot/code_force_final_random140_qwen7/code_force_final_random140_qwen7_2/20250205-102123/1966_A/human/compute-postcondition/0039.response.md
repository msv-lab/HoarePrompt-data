Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `n` will be an integer from the input split, `k` will be an integer from the input split, `arrC` will be a list of integers that has been fully processed, and `ans` will be `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears at least `k` times, otherwise `ans` will be `n`.**

Explanation: The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The loop continues to process `arrC` and update `hashmap` to count the occurrences of each element. Once the loop finishes, `ans` will be `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears at least `k` times, otherwise `ans` will be `n`.
