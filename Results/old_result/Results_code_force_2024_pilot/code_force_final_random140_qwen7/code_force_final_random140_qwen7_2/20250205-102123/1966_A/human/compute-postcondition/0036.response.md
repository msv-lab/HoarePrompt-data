Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will be as follows: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that has been fully processed, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of each key `i` from `arrC` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `arrC`, and `ans` is equal to `k - 1` if any key `i` in `hashmap` has a value that is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains equal to `n`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will either be `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears at least `k` times, or it will remain `n` if no such element exists. The `hashmap` will contain counts of each unique element in `arrC`, and `t`, `n`, and `k` will retain their initial values unless modified elsewhere in the code outside of the provided loop.
