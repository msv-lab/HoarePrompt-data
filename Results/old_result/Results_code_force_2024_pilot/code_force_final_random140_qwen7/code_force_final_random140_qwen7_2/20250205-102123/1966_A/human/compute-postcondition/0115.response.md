Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an integer from `arrC` and its frequency count plus one for each occurrence of `i` in `arrC`, and `ans` is `k - 1` as no integer in `arrC` reaches a frequency of `k` during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The loop condition is not specified, but since the problem statement mentions that after all iterations of the loop, the value of `ans` remains `k - 1`, it implies that the loop did not modify `ans` because no integer in `arrC` reached a frequency of `k`.
