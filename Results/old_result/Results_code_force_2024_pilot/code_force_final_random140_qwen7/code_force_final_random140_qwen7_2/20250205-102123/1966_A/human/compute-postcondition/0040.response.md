The loop head condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has been reduced by 1. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is reduced by 1 at each iteration, for the loop to continue, `t` must have been greater than 1 at the start of the current iteration. Thus, to ensure `t > 0` for the next iteration, `t` must be at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` will be an integer from the input split, `k` will be an integer from the input split, `arrC` will be a list of integers that has been fully processed, and `ans` will be `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears at least `k` times, otherwise `ans` will be `n`.**
