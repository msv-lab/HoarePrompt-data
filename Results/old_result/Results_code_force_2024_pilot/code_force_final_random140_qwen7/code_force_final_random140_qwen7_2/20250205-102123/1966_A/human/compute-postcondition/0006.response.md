Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in arrC:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arrC`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on each value from the list `arrC` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `arrC`: This is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `arrC`. Once `arrC` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will take on each value from `arrC`, we don't need to adjust its initial state. We just need to ensure that `arrC` is non-empty for the loop to execute.
   - `arrC` must contain at least one element for the loop to start executing.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `arrC` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`**
