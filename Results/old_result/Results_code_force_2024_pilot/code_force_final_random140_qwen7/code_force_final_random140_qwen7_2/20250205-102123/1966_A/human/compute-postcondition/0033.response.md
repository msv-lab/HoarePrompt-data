Output State: **`ans` is equal to `k - 1`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of key `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already present, otherwise it is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `k - 1` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, or `hashmap`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
