Postcondition: `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `i` was already in `hashmap`, and `ans` is `k - 1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
