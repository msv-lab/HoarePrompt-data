Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `hashmap`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `arrC`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
