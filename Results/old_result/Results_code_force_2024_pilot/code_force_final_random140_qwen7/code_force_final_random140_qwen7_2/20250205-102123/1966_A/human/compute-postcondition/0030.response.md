Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of key `i` is now 1 (since `hashmap[i]` was set to 1), and `ans` remains equal to `n`.**

The code `hashmap[i] = 1` sets the value of `hashmap[i]` to 1. Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `i`, the only thing we know for sure is that the value of `hashmap[i]` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
