Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element, and `hashmap` is a dictionary. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, then the value of `i` in `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, then `i` is added to `hashmap` with the value `1`. Additionally, the value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the next `i` in `arrC` will be incremented by 1 if it exists, or added with the value `1` if it does not exist, and the value of `hashmap[i]` will be incremented by 1 for the next `i` in `arrC` if `i` is in `hashmap`, otherwise the value of `hashmap[i]` will be set to `1`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged; otherwise, the value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is `k - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element (now missing the first element), `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the next `i` in `arrC` is incremented by 1 if it exists, or added with the value `1` if it does not exist, and the value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1 for the next `i` in `arrC` if `i` is in `hashmap`, otherwise the value of `hashmap[i]` is set to `1`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `hashmap[i]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
