Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))
    hashmap = {}
    ans = n
    for i in arrC:
        if i in hashmap:
            hashmap[i] += 1
        else:
            hashmap[i] = 1
        if hashmap[i] >= k:
            ans = k - 1
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is reduced by 1, `n` will be an integer from the input split, `k` will be an integer from the input split, `arrC` will be a list of integers that has been fully processed, and `ans` will be `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears at least `k` times, otherwise `ans` will be `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is decreased by 1, `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split, `n` is the original length of `arrC`, `k` retains its original value, `hashmap` contains counts of each integer in `arrC`, and `ans` is `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times; otherwise, `ans` remains `n` (the original value of `ans`).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arrC` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an integer from `arrC` and its frequency count plus one for each occurrence of `i` in `arrC`, and `ans` is `k - 1` as no integer in `arrC` reaches a frequency of `k` during the loop iterations.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
