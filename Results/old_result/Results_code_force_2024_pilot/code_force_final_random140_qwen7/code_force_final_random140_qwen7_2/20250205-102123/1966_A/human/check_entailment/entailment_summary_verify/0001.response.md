### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis step by step to confirm the correctness of the program.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `arrC`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`, which represents the initial number of cards.
   - It uses a dictionary `hashmap` to count the occurrences of each card number.

3. **Processing Each Card:**
   - For each card number `i` in `arrC`, it updates the count in `hashmap`.
   - If the count of any card number `i` reaches or exceeds `k`, it sets `ans` to `k - 1`. This is because once a card number has `k` or more cards, we can exchange them for `k - 1` new cards, effectively reducing the total count of cards by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all cards for a test case, it prints `ans` and decrements `t` to move to the next test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Counting Cards:**
   - The use of `hashmap` to count occurrences of each card number is correct.

3. **Updating Minimum Cards:**
   - The logic to set `ans` to `k - 1` when a card number has `k` or more cards is correct. This ensures that we reduce the count of cards optimally.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The final output for each test case is the correct minimum number of cards that can be left.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 3
  4 1 1 4 4
  ```

- Processing:
  - `hashmap` will be updated as follows:
    - `4`: 3 (3 >= 3, so `ans` becomes 2)
    - `1`: 2
  - Final `ans` is 2.

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  1 10
  7
  ```

- Processing:
  - `hashmap` will be updated as follows:
    - `7`: 1
  - Final `ans` is 1.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the specified operations. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
