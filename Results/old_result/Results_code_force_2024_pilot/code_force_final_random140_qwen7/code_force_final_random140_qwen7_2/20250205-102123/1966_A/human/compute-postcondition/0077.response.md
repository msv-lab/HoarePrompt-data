Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split, `n` is the original length of `arrC`, `k` retains its original value, `hashmap` contains counts of each integer in `arrC`, and `ans` is `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times; otherwise, `ans` remains `n` (the original value of `ans`).**

In this case, the only variable that changes is `t`, which is decremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values as per the initial state.
