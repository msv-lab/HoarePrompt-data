Postcondition: `arrC` is a list of integers from the input split that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arrC`. If `i` is in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1, and if the incremented value is greater than or equal to `k`, the final value of `hashmap[i]` is `k - 1`. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is set to 1, and if the value of `hashmap[i]` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, the final value of `hashmap[i]` is `k - 1`.
