Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `t` times.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle using `[int(i) for i in input().split()]`.

2. **Conditions for Output:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine whether a new rectangle can be formed:
     - **Condition 1:** If both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`), it prints 'yes'. This condition is correct because if both dimensions are even, you can always cut the rectangle into smaller even-sized rectangles, which can be rearranged into a different rectangle.
     - **Condition 2:** If either `a` or `b` is even but not both, it uses additional logic:
       - `a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b`: This condition is checking if `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`. However, this condition is flawed because it does not account for the case where `b` is even and `a` is odd, or vice versa.
       - `b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a`: Similarly, this condition is flawed for the same reason as above.

3. **Flawed Conditions:**
   - The conditions `a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b` and `b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a` are incorrect because they do not cover all scenarios where a new rectangle can be formed.
   - For example, consider the test case `2 6`. Here, `a` is even, and cutting it into two `2x3` rectangles allows forming a `4x3` rectangle, which should return 'yes'. However, the current logic would incorrectly return 'no' because `a / 2 != b`.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if at least one of the dimensions is even, and then ensure that the resulting rectangles after cutting can form a different rectangle. A more accurate approach would be:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program has logical flaws in its conditions and will produce incorrect results for certain test cases. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
