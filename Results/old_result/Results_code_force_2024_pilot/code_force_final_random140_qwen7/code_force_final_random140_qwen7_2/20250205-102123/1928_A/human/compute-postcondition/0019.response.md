Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `b` is the second integer from the input.
- Either both `a` and `b` are even numbers, or `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, or `a` is odd or `b` is odd, and if `a` is odd, `a / 2 == b` or if `b` is odd, `b / 2 == a`.

The `print('no')` statement will simply print the string 'no'.

Output: **no**
