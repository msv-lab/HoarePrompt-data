Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Output: **'yes'**
