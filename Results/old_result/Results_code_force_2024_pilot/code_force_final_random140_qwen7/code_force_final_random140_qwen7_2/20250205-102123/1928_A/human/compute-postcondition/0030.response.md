Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a value based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `t`.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. It does not accept these as direct parameters within the function definition but rather seems to process them as implied inputs. The function then returns a value for each test case based on the given constraints and relationships between `a`, `b`, and `t`.
