### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the given program has issues with the conditions used to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. Let's break down the issues and provide a correct solution:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If true, it prints 'yes'. This part is correct because if both dimensions are even, they can be divided into smaller even-sized rectangles, allowing the formation of a new rectangle.
   
2. **Flawed Conditions**:
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b or (b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a)` is incorrect. This condition does not cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. For example, a 4x3 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 6x2 rectangle, which is not covered by the given condition.

3. **Handling Odd Dimensions**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the case where both dimensions are odd, always printing 'no'. This is incorrect because even if both dimensions are odd, the rectangle can still be cut and rearranged to form a new rectangle. For example, a 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 6x1 rectangle.

### Correct Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles if at least one of the dimensions is even.
- After cutting, the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle if the sum of their areas equals the area of the original rectangle.

### Correct Program Logic:
- Check if at least one of the dimensions is even.
- If both dimensions are odd, check if the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0):
            print('yes')
        elif (a * b) % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Explanation:
- The condition `if (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0)` checks if at least one of the dimensions is even, which is correct.
- The additional condition `elif (a * b) % 2 == 0` ensures that if both dimensions are odd, the total area is even, which means the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions. The correct program should check if at least one dimension is even or if the total area is even when both dimensions are odd.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the given program.
