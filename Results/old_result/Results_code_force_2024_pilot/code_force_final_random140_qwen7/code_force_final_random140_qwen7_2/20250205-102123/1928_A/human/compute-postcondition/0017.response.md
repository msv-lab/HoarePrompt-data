Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `b` is the second integer from the input.
- The conditions for `a` and `b` are:
  - Both `a` and `b` are even numbers.
  - `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`.
  - `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`.
  - `a` is odd or `b` is odd.
  - If `a` is odd, then `a / 2 == b`.
  - If `b` is odd, then `b / 2 == a`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('yes')` will always print the string "yes" regardless of the specific values of `a` and `b` as long as they meet one of the specified conditions.

Output: **yes**
