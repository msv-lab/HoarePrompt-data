Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and either `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, or `a` is odd or `b` is odd and one of the following holds: `a` is even and half of `a` equals `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` equals `a`.
