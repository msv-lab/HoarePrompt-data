You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b or (b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a):
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b or b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 9999 (since the loop runs `t` times), `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, and the loop has executed `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving `a` and `b`. If the conditions are met, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle for each test case.

2. **Conditions for Cutting and Forming New Rectangles**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`). If true, it prints 'yes' because cutting an even-sized rectangle into two smaller even-sized rectangles allows forming a new rectangle.
   - The second condition `elif a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b or (b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a):` is intended to handle cases where one dimension is even but not exactly half of the other. However, this condition is flawed:
     - `a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b`: This condition checks if `a` is even and `a / 2` is not equal to `b`. This doesn't cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
     - `(b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a)`: Similarly, this checks if `b` is even and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`. Again, this doesn't cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The program incorrectly handles the case where either `a` or `b` is odd, always printing 'no'.

### Correct Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles if at least one of the dimensions is even.
- After cutting, the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle if the sum of their areas equals the area of the original rectangle.

### Revised Program Logic:
- Check if at least one of the dimensions is even.
- If both dimensions are odd, no new rectangle can be formed.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0):
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
