Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, and either both `a` and `b` are even numbers, or `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, or `a` is odd or `b` is odd, and if `a` is odd, `a / 2 == b` or if `b` is odd, `b / 2 == a`.**

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the if and else parts do not change the conditions specified in the precondition. The if and else parts simply restate the same conditions without altering the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.
