Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code takes two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The specific values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input provided.
