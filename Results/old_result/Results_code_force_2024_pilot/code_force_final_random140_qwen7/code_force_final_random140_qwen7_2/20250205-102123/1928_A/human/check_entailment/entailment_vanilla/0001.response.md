Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle for each test case.

2. **Conditions for Cutting and Forming New Rectangles**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`). If true, it prints 'yes' because cutting an even-sized rectangle into two smaller even-sized rectangles allows forming a new rectangle.
   - The second condition `elif a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b or (b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a):` is intended to handle cases where one dimension is even but not exactly half of the other. However, this condition is flawed:
     - `a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b`: This condition checks if `a` is even and `a / 2` is not equal to `b`. This doesn't cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
     - `(b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a)`: Similarly, this checks if `b` is even and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`. Again, this doesn't cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The program incorrectly handles the case where either `a` or `b` is odd, always printing 'no'.

### Correct Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles if at least one of the dimensions is even.
- After cutting, the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle if the sum of their areas equals the area of the original rectangle.

### Revised Program Logic:
- Check if at least one of the dimensions is even.
- If both dimensions are odd, no new rectangle can be formed.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0):
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
