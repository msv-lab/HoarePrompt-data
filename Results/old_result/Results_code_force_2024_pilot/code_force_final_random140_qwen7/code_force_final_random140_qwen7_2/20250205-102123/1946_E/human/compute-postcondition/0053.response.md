Output State: **`cur` is 4, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is 3, and `M2` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 4. The other variables (`M1`, `nums_left`, `i`, `M2`, and `N`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the condition that `N` must be greater than 3.
