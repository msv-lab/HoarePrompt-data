Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, M1 is an integer such that 1 ≤ M1 ≤ N, M2 is an integer such that 1 ≤ M2 ≤ N, L is a list of M1 integers in strictly increasing order where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N, and R is a list of M2 integers in strictly increasing order where 1 ≤ R[i] ≤ N, and L is updated to a list of integers inputted by the user.**

The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `L`. The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `L` is a list of `M1` integers in strictly increasing order where each integer is between 1 and `N` still holds, but now `L` is updated to reflect the new list of integers provided by the user.
