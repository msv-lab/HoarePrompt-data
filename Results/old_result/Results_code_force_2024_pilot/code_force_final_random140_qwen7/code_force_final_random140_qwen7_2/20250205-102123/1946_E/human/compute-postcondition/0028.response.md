Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `M1` is greater than 1.
   - `nums_left` is `L[-1]` - 3.
   - `i` is decreased by 1.

3. **Analyze the loop head variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1. Since `i` was decreased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is still greater than 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `i` is greater than 1. Given that `i` was decreased by 1, the new value of `i` must be such that it is still greater than 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1]` - 3, `i` must be greater than 1**
