Output State: **`cur` is `M1` - 3, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1]` - 2, `i` is greater than 1, and the current value of `i` is equal to the value of `L[cur]`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `M1 - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `M1 - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
