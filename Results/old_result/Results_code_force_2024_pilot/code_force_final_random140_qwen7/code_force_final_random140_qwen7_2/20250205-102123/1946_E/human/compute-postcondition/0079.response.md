Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns 0 in all cases except the fourth case, where it returns ans, which is updated to its previous value multiplied by nums_left modulo MOD if i does not equal R[cur] during the last iteration, and cur is set to 3.**

This means the function does not take any input parameters. It has four possible return points, but in the first three cases, it always returns 0. In the fourth case, it returns a value `ans` that has been modified according to specific conditions involving `nums_left`, `MOD`, `i`, and `cur`.
