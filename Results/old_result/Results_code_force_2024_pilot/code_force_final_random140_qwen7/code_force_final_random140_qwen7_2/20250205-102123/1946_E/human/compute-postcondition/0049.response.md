Output State: **`cur` is 1, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is 3, and `M2` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is updated to `R[0] + 1`. Given that `i` was initially 2, it now becomes 3 (assuming `R[0]` is 2). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
