Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly handle the scenario where the last prefix maximum index (`L[-1]`) is equal to the first suffix maximum index (`R[0]`), but they are not the same element. This can happen when the permutation has a specific structure where the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are adjacent and not the same element.

For example, consider the following input:
- `N = 4`, `M1 = 2`, `M2 = 2`
- `L = [1, 3]`
- `R = [3, 4]`

In this case, `L[-1]` (which is 3) is equal to `R[0]` (which is also 3), but they do not represent the same element in the permutation. The current implementation of `func_2` would incorrectly return 0 for this case, as it checks if `L[-1] != R[0]` and returns 0 without considering the actual permutation structure.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `L[-1]` and `R[0]` are equal but not the same element in the permutation. This requires a more detailed analysis of the permutation structure, which the current implementation does not provide.
