### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Input**: `n1` and `n2` where `n1` is the length of the permutation minus one, and `n2` is an index.
- **Output**: The function returns a value calculated using factorials and modular inverses.
- **Logic**:
  - If `n1 == n2`, it returns 1.
  - If `n2 == 0`, it returns 1.
  - It calculates the factorial of `n1 + 1` and stores it in `f1`.
  - It updates `f2` and `f3` to intermediate values of `f1`.
  - It computes the modular inverse of `f2 * f3` and multiplies it with `f1` to get the result.

This function seems to correctly implement the combinatorial calculation needed for the problem.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Input**: `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` where `N` is the length of the permutation, `M1` and `M2` are the counts of prefix and suffix maximums, and `L` and `R` are the indices of these maximums.
- **Output**: The number of suitable permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Logic**:
  - It checks if the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. If not, it returns 0.
  - It checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. If not, it returns 0.
  - It checks if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If so, it returns 0.
  - It calls `func_1` with `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` to get the initial count of suitable permutations.
  - It iterates through the indices in `L` and adjusts the count of suitable permutations based on the positions of the indices.
  - It iterates through the indices in `R` and adjusts the count of suitable permutations based on the positions of the indices.

The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly handle the constraints and adjust the count of suitable permutations based on the given indices.

### Verification

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the factorial and modular inverse as required.
   - The logic is sound and follows the mathematical derivation for the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly checks the constraints and ensures the indices are consistent.
   - It correctly adjusts the count of suitable permutations based on the positions of the indices.
   - The overall logic is correct and follows the problem constraints.

3. **Overall Structure**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The input processing and output formatting are correct.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and the annotated version, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem constraints accurately.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
