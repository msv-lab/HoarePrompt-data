Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Initially, `nums_left` was defined as `L[-1] - 3`. After subtracting 1, `nums_left` becomes `L[-1] - 4`. All other variables (`cur`, `M1`, `i`) remain unchanged.
