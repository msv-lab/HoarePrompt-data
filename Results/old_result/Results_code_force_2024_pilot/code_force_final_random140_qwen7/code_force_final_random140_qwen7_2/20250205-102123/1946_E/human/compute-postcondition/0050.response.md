State right before the while loop: `cur` is 1, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is 3, and `M2` is greater than 1.
```
while i < N:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. Right before the loop, `i` is 3.
3. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `N`.

Given that `i` is currently 3, the only way to ensure that the loop can execute the first time is to make sure that `N` is greater than 3.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `N` must be greater than 3.

State: **`cur` is 1, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is 3, and `M2` is greater than 1, and `N` must be greater than 3**
