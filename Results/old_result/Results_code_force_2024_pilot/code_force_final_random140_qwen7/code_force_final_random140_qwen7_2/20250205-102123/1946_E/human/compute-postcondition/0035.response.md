Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `M1` is greater than 1.
   - `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`.
   - `i` is decreased by 1.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i > 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1 after this adjustment.

Given that `i` was just decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 1 after this decrease. This means `i` must have been 2 before the decrease (since decreasing 2 by 1 gives 1, and we need `i` to be greater than 1).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure it is greater than 1 after being decreased by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` must be greater than 1**
