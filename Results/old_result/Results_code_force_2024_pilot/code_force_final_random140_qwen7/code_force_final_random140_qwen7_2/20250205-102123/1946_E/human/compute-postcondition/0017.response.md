Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while i > 1:`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i > 1`.

3. **Current state of `i`**: According to the provided state right before the loop, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state to satisfy the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 1. Given that `i` is currently `L[-1] - 1`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`.

5. **Simplify the condition**: Simplifying the condition `L[-1] - 1 > 1` gives us `L[-1] > 2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the current value of `i` (which is derived from `L[-1]`) to ensure it is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is M1 - 2, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is L[-1] - 2, `i` must be greater than 1**
