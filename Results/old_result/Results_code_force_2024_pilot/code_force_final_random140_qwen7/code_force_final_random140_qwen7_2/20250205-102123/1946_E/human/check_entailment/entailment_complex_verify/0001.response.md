### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Calculates a specific value using factorials and modular inverses.
- **Parameters**: `n1` and `n2`.
- **Logic**:
  - If `n1 == n2`, it returns 1.
  - If `n2 == 0`, it returns 1.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of `n1 + 1` modulo `MOD` and uses modular inverses to compute a specific value.

Here's the detailed breakdown:
1. **Initialization**: `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` are initialized to 1.
2. **Factorial Calculation**: For each `i` from 1 to `n1`, `f1` is updated to `f1 * i % MOD`.
3. **Intermediate Values**: Depending on the value of `i`, `f2` and `f3` are set to intermediate values of `f1`.
4. **Modular Inverse**: The modular inverse of `f2 * f3` is computed and used to calculate the final result.

The logic in `func_1` seems correct for calculating the required value using factorials and modular inverses.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Processes the input for a single test case and calculates the number of suitable permutations.
- **Parameters**: `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R`.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads the input values and lists `L` and `R`.
  - Performs several checks to ensure the indices are consistent with the problem constraints.
  - Calls `func_1` with appropriate arguments to compute the number of suitable permutations.
  - Iterates through the indices in `L` and `R` to adjust the count of suitable permutations based on the positions of the indices.

Here's the detailed breakdown:
1. **Input Reading**: Reads `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R`.
2. **Consistency Checks**:
   - Checks if the last index in `L` is equal to the first index in `R`.
   - Checks if the first index in `L` is 1 and the last index in `R` is `N`.
   - Checks additional conditions for consistency between `L` and `R`.
3. **Permutation Count Calculation**: Uses `func_1` to calculate the initial count and adjusts it based on the positions of the indices in `L` and `R`.

The logic in `func_2` seems correct for processing the input and applying the necessary checks.

#### Overall Structure:
- **Main Function**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_2`.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: Handles multiple test cases as expected.

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the required value using factorials and modular inverses.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly processes the input and applies the necessary checks.
- The overall structure of the program handles multiple test cases as expected.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, the program appears to follow the correct logic for solving the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to handle the calculations and checks appropriately. Therefore, the given program should be correct based on the problem description.

### Final Answer
