Output State: **`cur` is 3 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `cur` is 2, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 4`, `i` is 6, `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 5, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 6. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
