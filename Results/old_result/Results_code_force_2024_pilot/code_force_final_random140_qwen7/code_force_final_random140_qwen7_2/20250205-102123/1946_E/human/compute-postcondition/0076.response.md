Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - N + 1`, and `i` is `N`. If `i` equals `R[cur]` at the last iteration, `cur` remains unchanged and `M2` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is incremented accordingly.
