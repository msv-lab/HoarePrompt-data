Output State: **`cur` is M1 - 2, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is L[-1] - 2, `i` is not equal to L[cur], `i` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans` * (`nums_left`) % `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
