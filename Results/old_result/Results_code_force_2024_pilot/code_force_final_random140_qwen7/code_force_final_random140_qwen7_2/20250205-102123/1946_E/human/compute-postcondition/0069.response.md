Output State: **`ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 2, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is 5, `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `N` must be greater than 5.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. The values of `cur`, `M1`, `nums_left`, `i`, `M2`, and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
