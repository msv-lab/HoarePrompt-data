Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`, `i` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Initially, `nums_left` was `L[-1] - 4`. After decrementing, it becomes `L[-1] - 5`. The other variables (`cur`, `M1`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.
