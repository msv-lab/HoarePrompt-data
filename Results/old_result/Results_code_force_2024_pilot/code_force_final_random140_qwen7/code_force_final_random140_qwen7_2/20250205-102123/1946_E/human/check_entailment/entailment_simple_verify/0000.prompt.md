You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

        #To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the changes in the variables within the loop:
        #
        #1. The variable `i` starts from `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it becomes 1. Therefore, after `N` iterations, `i` will be `1`.
        #
        #2. The variable `nums_left` starts from `L[-1] - 2` and decreases by 1 with each iteration. After `N` iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - N`.
        #
        #3. The variable `cur` is decremented by 1 whenever `i` equals `L[cur]`. However, without knowing the exact value of `L[cur]` or the specific sequence of comparisons, we can only say that `cur` remains an integer but its exact value depends on the conditions inside the loop. Since no further information about `cur` is given, we keep it as "an integer".
        #
        #4. The variable `M1` is not affected by the loop and remains greater than 1.
        #
        #Thus, after all iterations, the output state will be as described above.
    #State: `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N`, and `i` is 1.

        i = R[0] + 1

                cur += 1

                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            
            nums_left -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `cur` is 3, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - N + 1`, `i` is `N`, and `M2` is greater than 1 if `i` equals `R[cur]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.
        #
        #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `N` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `N`. The variable `cur` will be 3 if `i` does not equal `R[cur]` during any iteration, or it will be incremented based on the condition inside the loop. Since `nums_left` decreases by 1 each time through the loop and the loop runs `N - R[0] - 1` times, `nums_left` will be `N - R[0] - N + 1` after all iterations. The conditions for `M1` and `M2` remain as described, with `M2` being greater than 1 unless `i` equals `R[cur]` at the last iteration.
    #State: Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - N + 1`, and `i` is `N`. If `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, `cur` is 3 and `M2` remains greater than 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is 3.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is updated to its previous value multiplied by nums_left modulo MOD if i does not equal R[cur] during the last iteration, and cur is set to 3.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly handle the scenario where the last prefix maximum index (`L[-1]`) is equal to the first suffix maximum index (`R[0]`), but they are not the same element. This can happen when the permutation has a specific structure where the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are adjacent and not the same element.

For example, consider the following input:
- `N = 4`, `M1 = 2`, `M2 = 2`
- `L = [1, 3]`
- `R = [3, 4]`

In this case, `L[-1]` (which is 3) is equal to `R[0]` (which is also 3), but they do not represent the same element in the permutation. The current implementation of `func_2` would incorrectly return 0 for this case, as it checks if `L[-1] != R[0]` and returns 0 without considering the actual permutation structure.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `L[-1]` and `R[0]` are equal but not the same element in the permutation. This requires a more detailed analysis of the permutation structure, which the current implementation does not provide.
