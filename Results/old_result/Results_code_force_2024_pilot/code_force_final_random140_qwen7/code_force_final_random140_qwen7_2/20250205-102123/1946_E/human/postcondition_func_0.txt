The function accepts two parameters, n1 and n2, where n1 is an integer and n2 is an integer such that 0 <= n2 <= n1. It returns 1 if n1 equals n2 or if n2 equals 0. Otherwise, it calculates f1 as the factorial of n1 + 1 modulo MOD, sets f2 and f3 to the value of f1, computes the modular inverse of f2 * f3 modulo MOD, and returns the product of f1 and the modular inverse, all modulo MOD.
