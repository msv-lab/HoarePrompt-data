Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is a list of characters from a new input string.
   - `start` is the index of 'B' in `x`.
   - `end` is the length of `x` minus one minus the index of 'B' in the reversed list `x`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(end - start)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - We need to determine the value of `end - start`.
   - `start` is the index of 'B' in `x`.
   - `end` is calculated as the length of `x` minus one minus the index of 'B' in the reversed list `x`.

Let's denote the length of the list `x` as `n`.

- If 'B' is found at index `k` in `x`, then `start = k`.
- The reversed list `x[::-1]` will have 'B' at index `n - 1 - k` (since reversing the list changes the indexing).
- Therefore, `end = n - 1 - (n - 1 - k) = k`.

So, `end - start` becomes `k - k = 0`.

Output: **0**
