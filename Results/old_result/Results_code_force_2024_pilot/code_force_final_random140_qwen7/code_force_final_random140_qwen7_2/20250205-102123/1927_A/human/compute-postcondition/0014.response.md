Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of characters from the input string, `start` and `end` are unchanged if 'B' was found, otherwise no additional variables are set.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `start`, and `end`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
