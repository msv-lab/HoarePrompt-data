Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in s is 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the string s contains at least one 'B' and returns True if true, otherwise False.**
