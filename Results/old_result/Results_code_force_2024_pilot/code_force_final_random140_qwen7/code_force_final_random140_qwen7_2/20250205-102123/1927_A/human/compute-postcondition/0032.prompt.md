You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in s is 'B'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        t = int(input())
        
        x = list(input())
        
        if 'B' in x:
            start = x.index('B')
            end = len(x) - x[::-1].index('B') - 1
            print(end - start)
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is a list of characters from the final input string. If 'B' is found in the list `x`, `start` is the index of the first 'B' and `end` is the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list `x`. If 'B' is not found in the list `x`, no additional variables are modified.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in s is 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the string s contains at least one 'B' and returns True if true, otherwise False.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
