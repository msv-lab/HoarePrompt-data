Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of characters from the new input string. If 'B' is found in `x`, `start` is the index of 'B' in `x`, and `end` is the length of `x` minus one minus the index of 'B' in the reversed list `x`. If 'B' is not found, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**
