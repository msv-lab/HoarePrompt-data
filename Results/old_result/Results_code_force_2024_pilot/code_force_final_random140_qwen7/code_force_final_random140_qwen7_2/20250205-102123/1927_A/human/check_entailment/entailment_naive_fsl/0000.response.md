Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the black cell ('B') appears more than once in the strip. For example, consider the input:

```
6
BWBWWB
```

The expected output is `4`, but the program will incorrectly output `2` because it only considers the first occurrence of 'B' and the last occurrence of 'B' without checking the entire strip. This leads to an incorrect result for this and similar cases.
