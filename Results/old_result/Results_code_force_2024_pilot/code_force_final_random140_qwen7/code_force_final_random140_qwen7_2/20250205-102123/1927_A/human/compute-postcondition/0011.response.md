Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of characters from the input string. If 'B' is in the list `x`, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B', and `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the reversed list `x`. If 'B' is not in the list `x`, no additional variables are defined.
