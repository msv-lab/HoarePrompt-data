Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values and conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` is not explicitly given, but it is derived from the condition `i < n` in the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged (it was not specified how `n` is determined, but it should stay the same for the next iteration).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of characters from the new input string, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**
