Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of characters from the new input string. If 'B' is found in the list `x`, `start` is the index of the first 'B' and `end` is the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list `x`. If 'B' is not found in the list `x`, no new variables `start` and `end` are introduced.
