Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. The initial condition that `n` must be between 1 and 10 inclusive is no longer relevant since `n` is a different variable (`t`).
