To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `start` is the index of 'B' in the list `x`.
   - `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the reversed list `x`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(end - start)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the reversed list `x`.
   - `start` is the index of 'B' in the original list `x`.
   - The expression `end - start` calculates the distance between these two indices.

4. **Determine the Values**:
   - Since the exact input string is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `start` and `end`. However, we know that `end` refers to the last 'B' in the reversed list, and `start` refers to the first 'B' in the original list.
   - The difference `end - start` will give us the number of characters between the first and last 'B' in the original list, counting from the end of the list.

5. **Output**:
   - The output will be the difference between the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list and the index of the first 'B' in the original list.

Output: **the difference between the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list and the index of the first 'B' in the original list**
