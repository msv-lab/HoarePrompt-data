Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - If 'B' is found in the list `x`, `start` is the index of the first 'B', and `end` is the index of the last 'B' in the reversed list `x`.
   - If 'B' is not found in the list `x`, no additional variables are set.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n)`. This means the loop will run `n` times.

3. **Current Iteration**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop condition `i < n` is true if `n > 0`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to update the value of `i` to 1.

6. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The variables `n`, `x`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of characters from the input string, `start` and `end` are unchanged if 'B' was found, otherwise no additional variables are set.**
