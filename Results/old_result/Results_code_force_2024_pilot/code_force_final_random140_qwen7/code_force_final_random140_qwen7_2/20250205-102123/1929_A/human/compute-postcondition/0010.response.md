Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and assigns it to `ar`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. `ar` is updated to be a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
