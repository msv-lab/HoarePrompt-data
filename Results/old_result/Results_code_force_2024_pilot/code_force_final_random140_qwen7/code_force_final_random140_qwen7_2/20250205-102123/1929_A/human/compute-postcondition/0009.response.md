Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the new input integer that must be at least 1, `ar` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `ar` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` becomes the new input integer that must be at least 1 (as per the input), and `ar` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
