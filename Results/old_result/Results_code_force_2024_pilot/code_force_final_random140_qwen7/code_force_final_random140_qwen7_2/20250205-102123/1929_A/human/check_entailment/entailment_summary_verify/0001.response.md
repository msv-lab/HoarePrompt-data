### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic used in the program. Let's break down the steps and verify them:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `ar` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))`.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are placed at the beginning, which maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Specifically, the expression `sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)])` computes the sum of differences `(ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + ... + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are placed at the beginning, maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This is because the difference between two consecutive numbers in a sorted array is maximized when the smaller number comes first.

2. **Summing Differences:**
   - The sum of differences `(ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + ... + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])` is indeed the maximum possible beauty of the array after rearranging its elements.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - It correctly processes arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
