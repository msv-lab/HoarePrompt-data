### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the program's logic to understand why the assessment is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, we need to strategically arrange the elements of the array.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program sorts the array before calculating the beauty. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty because sorting does not ensure that the smallest and largest elements are optimally placed to maximize the sum of differences.

#### Example:
Consider the input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
```
- **Original Array**: \([2, 1, 3]\)
- **Sorted Array**: \([1, 2, 3]\)
- **Beauty Calculation**: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\)

This is correct for this specific case. However, let's consider another example:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
- **Original Array**: \([100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\)
- **Sorted Array**: \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\)
- **Beauty Calculation**: \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)

However, the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty is:
- **Optimal Arrangement**: \([100, 54, 90, 43, 80]\)
- **Beauty Calculation**: \((54 - 100) + (90 - 54) + (43 - 90) + (80 - 43) = -46 + 36 - 47 + 37 = -10 + 73 = 57 + 37 = 177 - 124 = 53\)

Clearly, the sorted array does not always yield the maximum beauty. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the maximum beauty of the array. The correct approach involves strategically placing the smallest and largest elements to maximize the sum of differences.
