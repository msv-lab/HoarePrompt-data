You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)]))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 500) representing the number of cases, followed by an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \) (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)). It then sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list, printing this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies the state by processing the input data according to the specified constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `ar` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))`.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Specifically, the expression `sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)])` computes the sum of differences `(ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + ... + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are placed at the beginning, maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This is because the difference between two consecutive numbers in a sorted array is maximized when the smaller number comes first.

2. **Summing Differences:**
   - The sum of differences `(ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + ... + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])` is indeed the maximum possible beauty of the array after rearranging its elements.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - It correctly processes arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
