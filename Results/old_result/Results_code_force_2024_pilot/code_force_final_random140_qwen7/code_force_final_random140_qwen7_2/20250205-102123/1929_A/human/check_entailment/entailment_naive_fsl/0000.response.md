Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the sorting of the array. Sorting the array does not guarantee that the maximum beauty will be achieved. Instead, to maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, and then alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
```
The program sorts the array to `[1, 2, 3]` and calculates the beauty as `2`, which is correct for this specific case. However, consider another case:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program sorts the array to `[54, 80, 90, 100]` and calculates the beauty as `57`. However, the correct approach would be to rearrange the array to `[100, 54, 90, 43, 80]`, which gives a beauty of `57 + 36 + 47 + 37 = 177`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
