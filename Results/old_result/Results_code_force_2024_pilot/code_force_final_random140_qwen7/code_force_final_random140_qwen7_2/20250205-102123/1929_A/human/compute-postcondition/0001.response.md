Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still must be an integer within the specified range.
