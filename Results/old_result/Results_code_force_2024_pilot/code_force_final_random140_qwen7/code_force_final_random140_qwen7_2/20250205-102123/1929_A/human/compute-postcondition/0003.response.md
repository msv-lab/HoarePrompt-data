Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The expression inside the `sum` function calculates the difference between consecutive elements in the list `ar` starting from the second element (`ar[1]`) up to the `n-1`th element.
   - Specifically, it computes the differences `ar[1] - ar[0]`, `ar[2] - ar[1]`, ..., `ar[n-1] - ar[n-2]`.
   - The `sum` function then adds these differences together.

Given the above, the output of the code snippet will be the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` from the first element to the `n-1`th element.

Output: **sum of differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar` from the first element to the `n-1`th element**
