Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression inside the `sum` function calculates the difference between consecutive elements in the list `ar` starting from index 1 up to index `n-1`.
   - For each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, the term `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` computes the difference between the current element and the previous element in the list.
   - The `sum` function then adds up all these differences.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `ar` is a sorted list of integers, the differences between consecutive elements represent the increments between the elements.
   - The sum of these differences gives the total increment from the first element to the last element in the list `ar` up to the `n-1`th element.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar` from the first element to the `n-1`th element.

Output: **sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar` from the first element to the `n-1`th element**
