Reasoning:
1. The function correctly processes multiple test cases as specified.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the list of integers \( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \).
3. The function sorts the list of integers before calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
4. Sorting the list ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which maximizes the overall sum of these differences.
5. The calculation of the sum of differences is done correctly using the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (ar[i] - ar[i-1])\), where \( ar \) is the sorted list of integers.
6. The function prints the result for each test case and does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above points, the function appears to implement the logic correctly for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
