### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program sorts the array and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array. However, let's systematically verify this through the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `ar` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))`.
   - Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are placed at the beginning, maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Specifically, the expression `sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)])` computes the sum of differences `(ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + ... + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])`.

### Detailed Verification:

- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array in non-decreasing order ensures that the smallest elements are placed at the beginning. This maximizes the positive differences between consecutive elements.
  - For example, if the array is `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting it gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The differences are `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`.

- **Summing Differences:**
  - The sum of differences `(ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + ... + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])` is indeed the maximum possible beauty of the array after rearranging its elements.
  - This is because the sorted array ensures that the smallest elements are subtracted from larger elements, maximizing the positive differences.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
  - It correctly processes arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed verification, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
