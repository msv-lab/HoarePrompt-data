Reasoning:
- The program iterates over each test case using a loop controlled by the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array elements.
- It sorts the array `ar` and then calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
- The sum of these differences is printed, which represents the beauty of the array after rearranging its elements.

Given the problem statement, the goal is to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, leading to the maximum possible sum of these differences.

The annotated program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array elements.
- It sorts the array `ar` and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
- Finally, it prints the result.

Since the program correctly follows the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
