The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 500) representing the number of cases, followed by an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \) (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)). It then sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list, printing this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies the state by processing the input data according to the specified constraints.
