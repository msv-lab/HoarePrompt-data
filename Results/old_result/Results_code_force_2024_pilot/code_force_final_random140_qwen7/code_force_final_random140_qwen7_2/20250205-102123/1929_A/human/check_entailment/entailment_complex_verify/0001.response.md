### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the behavior and correctness of the provided program. Let's break down the key points and verify them:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `ar` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))`.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are placed at the beginning, which maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Specifically, the expression `sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)])` computes the sum of differences `(ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + ... + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2])`.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - By sorting the array, we ensure that the smallest elements are at the beginning, and the largest elements are at the end.
   - This maximizes the differences between consecutive elements, leading to the highest possible beauty.

2. **Summing Differences:**
   - The expression `sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)])` correctly computes the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - This is the optimal way to maximize the beauty of the array since the differences are maximized when the smallest elements are paired with the next smallest, and so on.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - It correctly processes arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements. The original assessment accurately describes the behavior and correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
