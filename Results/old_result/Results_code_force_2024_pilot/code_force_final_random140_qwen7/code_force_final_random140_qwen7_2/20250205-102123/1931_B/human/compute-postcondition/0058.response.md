Output State: **`i` is 6; `current_balance` is increased by `a[6] - target`; `possible` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is set to `False`, which does not affect the values of `i` or `current_balance`. The value of `i` remains 6, and `current_balance` is updated by the value of `a[6] - target`.
