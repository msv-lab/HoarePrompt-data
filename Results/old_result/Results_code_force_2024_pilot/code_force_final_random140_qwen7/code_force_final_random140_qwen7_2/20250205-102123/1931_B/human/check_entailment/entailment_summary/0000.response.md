Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes variables to store the number of containers (`n`), the amounts of water in each container (`a`), the total amount of water (`total_water`), and the target amount of water per container (`target`).
3. **Target Calculation**: The target amount of water per container is calculated as `total_water // n`, which is the average amount of water each container should have if distributed evenly.
4. **Balance Check**: The program iterates through each container and keeps track of the balance (`current_balance`). This balance is the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to meet the target, and the program sets `possible` to `False`.
5. **Result Output**: After checking all containers, if `possible` is still `True`, it means the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program correctly follows the logic to determine if the redistribution is possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
