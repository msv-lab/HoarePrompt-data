Postcondition: `i` is 3, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, then no changes are made to `possible` and the loop or if statement continues as normal.
