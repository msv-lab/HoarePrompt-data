Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's why:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container.
3. It calculates the target amount of water per container, which is the total amount of water divided by `n`.
4. It then iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative balance of water (deviation from the target) remains non-negative. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means it's impossible to equalize the water amounts, and the program sets `possible` to `False`.
5. If the balance never goes negative, the program prints "YES", indicating it is possible to equalize the water amounts. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This approach works because:
- The sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring that the target amount of water per container is an integer.
- By maintaining a running balance, the program effectively checks if it's possible to redistribute the water such that the difference between any two containers' water amounts can be balanced out.

Since the program handles the given constraints and logic correctly without any apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail, it is considered correct.
