Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`
   - `n` is the same as before
   - `possible` remains unchanged

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it starts from `i = 0` and goes up to `i < n`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, the loop will continue to the next iteration where `i` will be incremented to 2.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `i`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be 2.
   - `n`, `current_balance`, and `possible` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is now 2
   - `current_balance` remains `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`
   - `n` remains the same as before
   - `possible` remains unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`, `n` is the same as before, `possible` remains unchanged**
