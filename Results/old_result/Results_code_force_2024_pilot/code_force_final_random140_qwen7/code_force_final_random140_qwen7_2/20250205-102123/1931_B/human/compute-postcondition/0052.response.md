Output State: **`i` is 5; `current_balance` is `current_balance + a[5] - target`; `possible` is False**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is set to `False`, which means no changes were made to its value. The values of `i` and `current_balance` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 5, and `current_balance` is still `current_balance + a[5] - target`.
