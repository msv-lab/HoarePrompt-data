Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, meaning `i` equals the length of the list `a`.
- `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Since `i` is `n`, the loop would have completed, and `current_balance` would be the sum of `a[i] - target` for all valid `i` values.
- `possible` is `True` because the condition inside the if statement is `possible`.
- `t` is `t-1`, but the value of `t` itself is not relevant to the print statement.
- `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
- `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.
- `target` is `total_water // n`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
