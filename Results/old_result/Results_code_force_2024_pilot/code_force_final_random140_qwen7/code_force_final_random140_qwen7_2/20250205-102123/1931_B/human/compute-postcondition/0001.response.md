State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), the minimum value `t` can take is 1.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted since there are no other variables or conditions in the loop head that affect the loop's execution.
