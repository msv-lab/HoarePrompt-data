Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. **Target Calculation**: It calculates the target amount of water per container, which is the total amount of water divided by `n`.
4. **Balance Check**: It iterates through each container and checks the balance. If at any point the cumulative balance becomes negative, it means it's impossible to distribute the water evenly, and the program sets `possible` to `False`.
5. **Output**: Based on the value of `possible`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, it correctly determines whether it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
