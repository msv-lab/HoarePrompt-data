Output State: **`i` is 6; `current_balance` is increased by `a[6] - target`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `current_balance` by adding the difference between the value at index `i` in the list `a` and the variable `target`. Since `i` is 6, `current_balance` is increased by `a[6] - target`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not mentioned or used in the code snippet.
