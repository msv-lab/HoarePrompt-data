Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`, `n` is the same as before, `possible` is False**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is set to `False`. The values of `i`, `current_balance`, `n`, and `possible` are updated accordingly. The initial values of `current_balance` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` and `possible` are updated as specified.
