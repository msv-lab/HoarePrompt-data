Output State: **`i` is 4, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` remains unchanged, `t` is t-1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is total_water // n.**

Explanation: The line `current_balance = 0` sets the value of `current_balance` to 0. All other variables (`i`, `possible`, `t`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
