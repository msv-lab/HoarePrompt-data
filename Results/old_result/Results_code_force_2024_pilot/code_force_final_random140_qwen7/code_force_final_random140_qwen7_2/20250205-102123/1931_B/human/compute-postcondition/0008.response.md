Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value of `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is given as an input integer.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 initially and `n` is greater than 0.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - The values of `current_balance`, `t`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `possible` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
