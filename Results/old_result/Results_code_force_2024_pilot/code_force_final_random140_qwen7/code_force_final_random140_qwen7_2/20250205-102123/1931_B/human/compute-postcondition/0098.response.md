Output State: **i is n, current_balance is the sum of (a[i] - target) for all i from 0 to n-1, and possible is False.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `current_balance` will hold the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Since the loop breaks when `current_balance` becomes less than 0, and given that the output state after the third iteration already shows `possible` as `False`, it means that `current_balance` became negative at some point during the loop's execution, leading to `possible` being set to `False` and the loop terminating early. Therefore, `possible` remains `False` after all iterations.
