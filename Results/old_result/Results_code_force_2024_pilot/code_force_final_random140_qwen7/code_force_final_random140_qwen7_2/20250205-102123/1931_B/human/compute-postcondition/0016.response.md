Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`.
   - `possible` is False.
   - The loop breaks if `current_balance` is less than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - `current_balance` and `possible` are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the loop body, which is omitted here. However, since no specific changes to these variables are mentioned, they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless explicitly changed within the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `current_balance` and `possible` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is False, `n` must be the same as before**.
