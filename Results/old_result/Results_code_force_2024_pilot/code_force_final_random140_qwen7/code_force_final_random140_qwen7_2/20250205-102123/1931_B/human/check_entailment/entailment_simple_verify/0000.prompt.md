You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `possible` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the condition `current_balance < 0` was ever met during any iteration, `t` is `0` since it starts from the value of the input integer `t` and decreases by `1` with each iteration until it reaches `0`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, and `target` is `total_water // n`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `current_balance` will hold the final balance calculated after processing all elements in list `a`, `possible` will indicate whether it was possible to distribute the water such that no one has a negative balance, `t` will be `0` as all inputs have been processed, and the other variables (`a`, `total_water`, and `target`) will retain their last computed values.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's why:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container.
3. It calculates the target amount of water per container, which is the total amount of water divided by `n`.
4. It then iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative balance of water (deviation from the target) remains non-negative. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means it's impossible to equalize the water amounts, and the program sets `possible` to `False`.
5. If the balance never goes negative, the program prints "YES", indicating it is possible to equalize the water amounts. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This approach works because:
- The sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring that the target amount of water per container is an integer.
- By maintaining a running balance, the program effectively checks if it's possible to redistribute the water such that the difference between any two containers' water amounts can be balanced out.

Since the program handles the given constraints and logic correctly without any apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail, it is considered correct.
