Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 5
   - `current_balance` is adjusted based on the value of `a[5]` and `target`
   - If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
   - If `current_balance` is not less than 0, no changes are made to `possible` and `current_balance`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 6`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 6.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be the same as before**
