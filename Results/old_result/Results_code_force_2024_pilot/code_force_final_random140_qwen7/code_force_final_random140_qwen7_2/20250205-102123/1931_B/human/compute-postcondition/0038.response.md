Output State: **`i` is 4, `current_balance` is a[0] - (total_water // n) + a[1] - (total_water // n) + a[2] - (total_water // n) + a[3] - (total_water // n), `possible` remains unchanged, `t` is t-1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is total_water // n.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `total_water` divided by `n` to `target`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, and `current_balance` is updated by subtracting `target` from each element in the list `a`.
