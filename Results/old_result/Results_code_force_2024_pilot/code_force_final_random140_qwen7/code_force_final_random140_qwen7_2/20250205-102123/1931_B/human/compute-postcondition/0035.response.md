Output State: **`i` is 4, `current_balance` is a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target + a[3] - target, `possible` remains unchanged, `t` is t-1, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `current_balance`, `possible`, and `t`) remain unchanged. The value of `current_balance` is calculated as `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target + a[3] - target`, and `t` is decremented by 1.
