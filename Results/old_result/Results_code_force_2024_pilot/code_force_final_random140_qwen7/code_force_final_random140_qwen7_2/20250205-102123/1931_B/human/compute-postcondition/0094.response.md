Output State: **`i` is 3, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target`, `possible` is `False`**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `i` and `current_balance` remain unchanged.
