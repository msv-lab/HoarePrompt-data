Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `possible` is `True`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no other variables or objects are being printed and their values are not required for this specific print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
