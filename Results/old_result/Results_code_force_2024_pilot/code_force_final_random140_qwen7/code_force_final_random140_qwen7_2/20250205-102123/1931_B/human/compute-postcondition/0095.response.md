Output State: **`i` is 3, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target`, `possible` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `current_balance`, and `possible`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
