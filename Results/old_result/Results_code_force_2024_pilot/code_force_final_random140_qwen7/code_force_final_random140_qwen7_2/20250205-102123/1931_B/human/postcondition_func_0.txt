The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of sub-cases), an integer `n` (number of non-negative integers), and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a`. It calculates whether it is possible to distribute the total amount of water represented by the sum of `a` equally among `n` people without any person having a negative balance. If such a distribution is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
