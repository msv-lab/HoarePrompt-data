Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, then no change occurs to `possible` and the loop or if statement continues as normal.
