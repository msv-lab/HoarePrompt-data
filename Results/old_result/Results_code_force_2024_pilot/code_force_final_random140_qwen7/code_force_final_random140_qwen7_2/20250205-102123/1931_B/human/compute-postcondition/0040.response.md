Output State: **`i` is 4, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` is True, `t` is t-1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `target` is total_water // n**.

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
