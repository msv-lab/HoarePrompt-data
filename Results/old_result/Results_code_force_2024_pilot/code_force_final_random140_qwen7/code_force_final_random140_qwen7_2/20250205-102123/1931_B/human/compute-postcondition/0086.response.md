Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`.
   - `possible` is either `True` or `False` based on the condition `if current_balance < 0: possible = False; break`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `current_balance` and `possible` will depend on the loop body, but since we don't know the exact operations inside the loop, we cannot determine their values precisely without the loop body. However, we know that if `current_balance` was less than 0 in the previous iteration, it would have been set to `False` and the loop would have been broken.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `current_balance` and `possible` will remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body changes them.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `n` is the same as before, `possible` remains unchanged**. 

Since we don't have the exact value of `n` or the updated value of `possible`, we can only specify what we know for sure:

State: **`i` is 1, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `n` is the same as before, `possible` remains unchanged**.
