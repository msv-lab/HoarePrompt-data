Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Calculating Target Water Amount**: For each test case, it calculates the target amount of water per container (`target`) by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers `n`.
3. **Checking Balance**: It iterates through each container and maintains a running balance of the difference between the cumulative water amount and the expected target. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means it's not possible to equalize the water amounts, and the program sets `possible` to `False`.
4. **Outputting Result**: After processing all containers, it prints 'YES' if it's possible to equalize the water amounts or 'NO' otherwise.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies whether it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water based on the given constraints and operations.
