### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another.
   - Given that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by \(n\), the target amount of water in each container would be the total amount of water divided by \(n\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The key insight is that if the total amount of water is divisible by \(n\), it is always possible to distribute the water evenly among the \(n\) containers by pouring water from one container to another. This is because the total amount of water can be exactly divided into \(n\) equal parts.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers \(n\) and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container, which is the total amount of water divided by \(n\).
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a balance variable `current_balance` to check if it's possible to reach the target without any negative balance.
   - If at any point `current_balance` becomes negative, it means it's not possible to achieve the target distribution, and the program sets `possible` to `False`.
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise 'NO'.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs, calculates the target amount of water per container, and checks if it is possible to distribute the water evenly without any negative balance.
   - The function correctly prints 'YES' if the distribution is possible and 'NO' otherwise.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - The program correctly handles the problem statement and the constraints.
   - The logic implemented in the program is sound and aligns with the key insight that the total amount of water being divisible by \(n\) ensures that an even distribution is always possible.
   - The use of `current_balance` to check for negative balances is unnecessary and could be simplified since the problem guarantees that the sum of water is divisible by \(n\), making the distribution always possible.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution to the problem, and the logic is sound.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
