Output State: **`i` is 3, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target`.**

Explanation: The variable `current_balance` is updated by adding the value of `a[i] - target` to its current value. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing the line `current_balance += a[i] - target`, `i` is incremented by 1 (making it 3), and `current_balance` is updated to `a[0] - target + a[1] - target + a[2] - target`. The other variables remain unchanged.
