Output State: **`i` is 0; `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`**

Explanation: The code updates `current_balance` by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `target`. Given that `i` is initially 0 and does not change, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. The value of `target` remains unchanged. Therefore, `current_balance` is updated to `a[0] - target`. The value of `i` remains 0 as no changes are made to it.
