Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` is 3, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes user input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `clues`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `answers`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
