Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` minus `a`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, the absolute difference between `y1` and 1 is less than the absolute difference between `y1` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code `y2 -= a` subtracts `a` from `y2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `y2` is now `y2 - a`. The conditions and relationships involving the other variables and their constraints remain the same.
