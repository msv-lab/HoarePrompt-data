Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by 1 plus `a`, `y1` is incremented by 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.
