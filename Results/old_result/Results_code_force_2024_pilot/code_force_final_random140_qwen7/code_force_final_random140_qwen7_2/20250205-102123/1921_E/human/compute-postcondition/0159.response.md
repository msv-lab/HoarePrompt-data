Based on the initial state provided:

- `answers` is a list containing at least two of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.
- `j` is the second element of the `answers` list.

Given this information, we know that `j` is assigned the second element of the `answers` list. Since the list contains at least two elements and these elements are either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', `j` must be one of these three strings.

Therefore, the `print(j)` statement will print the second element of the `answers` list.

Output: **'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' (depending on the content of the answers list)**
