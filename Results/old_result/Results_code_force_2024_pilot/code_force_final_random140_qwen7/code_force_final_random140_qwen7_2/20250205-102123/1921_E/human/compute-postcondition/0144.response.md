Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice', `i` is 4, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code appends 'Alice' to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains 'Bob' and 'Draw'. After appending 'Alice', `answers` becomes ['Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice']. Additionally, the value of `i` is incremented by 1 since the code does not affect `test_cases` or `clues`.
