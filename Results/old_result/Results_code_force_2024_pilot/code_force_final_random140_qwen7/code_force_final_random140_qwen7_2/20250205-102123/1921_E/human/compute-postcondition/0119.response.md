Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' based on specific conditions, `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, `answers` will contain 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3] == clues[5]` and the condition inside the else block is met, 'Alice' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the condition inside the if block is checked and either 'Bob' or 'Draw' is added to `answers` based on specific conditions. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`.**
