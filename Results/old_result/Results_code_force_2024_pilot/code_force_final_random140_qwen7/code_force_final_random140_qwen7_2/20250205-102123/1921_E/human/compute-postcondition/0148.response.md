Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, then `i` is set to 4 and `answers` remains as ['Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice']. Otherwise, if `clues[3] > clues[5]` and `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then an additional 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, `i` is set to 3 and `answers` remains as ['Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice'].
