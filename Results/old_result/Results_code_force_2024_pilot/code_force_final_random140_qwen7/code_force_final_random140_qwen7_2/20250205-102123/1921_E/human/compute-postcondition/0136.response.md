Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', `i` is either 3 or 4, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers. If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `i` is 3 and `answers` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `i` is 3 and `answers` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is 4 and `answers` is rearranged to contain 'Alice', 'Draw', and 'Bob' in that order.**
