Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is now equal to `m`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `y2` is increased by `a`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and `(abs(y1 - 1) ≥ abs(y1 - m))`.**

Explanation: The code `y2 += a` increases the value of `y2` by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `y2` is updated to its original value plus `a`.
