Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` is either 3 or 4 depending on the condition, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers. If `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `i` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 4.
