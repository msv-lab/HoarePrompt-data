You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b, and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    answers = []
    for i in range(test_cases):
        clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
            answers.append('Draw')
        elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4
            ] % 2 != 0:
            if clues[3] == clues[5]:
                answers.append('Bob')
            elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
                if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Bob')
            elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
                if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Alice')
        elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
            answers.append('Alice')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Alice')
        elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
            if clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Alice')
        
    #State: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' for each test case, and `i` is 9 (or any value up to `test_cases - 1`).
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
        
    #State: Output State: `answers` is a list containing all the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' specified in the original input, `j` is the last element of the `answers` list.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will have iterated through every element in the `answers` list, starting from the first element and ending with the last element. The `answers` list remains unchanged in terms of its content but has been fully traversed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b, where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. The function also accepts a positive integer t such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function determines whether (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) are distinct points and returns a boolean value indicating whether the coordinates are different.
