Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice', `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, or `'Alice'` based on specific conditions. After appending `'Alice'`, `answers` now contains `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Alice'`. Additionally, the value of `i` is incremented by 1 since the code snippet does not affect `test_cases` or `clues`.
