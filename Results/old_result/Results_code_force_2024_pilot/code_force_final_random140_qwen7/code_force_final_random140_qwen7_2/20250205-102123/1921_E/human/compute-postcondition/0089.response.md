Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is either 1 or `m`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` (or the sixth element of `r` plus `a` if `y1` is `m`), `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on the value of `y1`.
