Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' based on specific conditions, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `answers` ends with 'Bob'. If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, then 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to `answers`.
