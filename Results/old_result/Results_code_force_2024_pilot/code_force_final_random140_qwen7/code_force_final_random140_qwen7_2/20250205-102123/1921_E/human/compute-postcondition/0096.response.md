Based on the initial state provided, we need to determine the values of the variables involved in the print statement. Let's break down the information:

1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces.
3. `n` is the first element of `r`.
4. `m` is the second element of `r`.
5. `x1` is increased by `a`.
6. `y1` is either 1 or `m`.
7. `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`.
8. `y2` is the sixth element of `r` (or the sixth element of `r` plus `a` if `y1` is `m`).
9. `b` is `x2 - x1`.
10. `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
11. `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`.
12. `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
13. `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
14. `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
15. `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on the value of `y1`.
16. The condition `b // 2 â‰¤ a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `(y1 < 1 or y1 > m)` or `(x1 < 1 or x1 > n)` holds true.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('draw')` will simply print the string "draw" regardless of the specific values of the other variables because the string is hardcoded.

Output: **draw**
