Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, or `'Alice'` based on specific conditions. After appending `'Alice'`, `answers` now contains `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Alice'`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`) remain unchanged.
