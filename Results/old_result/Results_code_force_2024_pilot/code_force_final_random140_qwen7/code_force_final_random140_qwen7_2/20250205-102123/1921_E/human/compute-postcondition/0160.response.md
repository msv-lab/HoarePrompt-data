Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in answers`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `answers`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `answers` is a list containing at least two of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.
   - `j` is the second element of the `answers` list.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be the next element in the `answers` list. Since `j` was the second element in the previous iteration, it means `j` has already been set to the second element of `answers`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will now be the third element of `answers` (since it iterates through the list).
   - `answers` remains the same as it is the iterable object being looped over.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is now the third element of `answers`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`answers` is a list containing at least two of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', `j` is the third element of the `answers` list**
