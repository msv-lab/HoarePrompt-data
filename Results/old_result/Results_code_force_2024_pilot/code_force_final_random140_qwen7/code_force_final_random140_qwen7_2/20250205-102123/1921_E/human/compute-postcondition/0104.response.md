Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw' as the last element, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `answers` now contains `'Draw'` as its last element.
