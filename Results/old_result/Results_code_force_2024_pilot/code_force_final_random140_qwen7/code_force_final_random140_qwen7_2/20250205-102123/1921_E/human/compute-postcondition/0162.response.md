Output State: `answers` is a list containing all the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' corresponding to each test case, `j` is the last element of the `answers` list.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will have iterated through every element in the `answers` list, and `answers` will contain all the original elements it started with, as the loop only prints each element without modifying the list.
