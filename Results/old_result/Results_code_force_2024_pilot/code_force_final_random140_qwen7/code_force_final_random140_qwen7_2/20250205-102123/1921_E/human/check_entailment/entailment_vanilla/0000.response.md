Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case into variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.

2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints "draw" which is correct because Bob cannot move above Alice's initial position, and Alice cannot move below Bob's initial position, leading to a draw.

3. **Odd Difference Check**: If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, it means the vertical distance between the two players is odd. In this scenario:
   - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can always move diagonally to capture Bob, so Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, the program attempts to move both players closer to each other, but the logic here seems overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.

4. **Even Difference Check**: If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, it means the vertical distance between the two players is even. In this scenario:
   - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can always move vertically to capture Alice, so Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, similar to the odd case, the program attempts to move both players closer to each other, but again, the logic is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases properly, especially when the players are very close to the boundaries of the board. The logic for moving players and checking distances is convoluted and may lead to incorrect outcomes.

6. **Output**: The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "draw" based on the conditions checked, but the logic is flawed in handling the movement and capturing scenarios.

Given the complexity and potential edge cases not handled correctly, the program is likely to produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
