Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' based on specific conditions, `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, and `clues[3] < clues[5]`, then 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, and `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' is added to `answers`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, and none of the above conditions are met, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` do not satisfy the condition of being both even or both odd, and `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` do not satisfy the condition of being both even or both odd, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the condition inside the if block is checked and either 'Bob' or 'Draw' is appended to `answers` based on specific conditions. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` do not satisfy the condition of being both even or both odd, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not 1, then 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
