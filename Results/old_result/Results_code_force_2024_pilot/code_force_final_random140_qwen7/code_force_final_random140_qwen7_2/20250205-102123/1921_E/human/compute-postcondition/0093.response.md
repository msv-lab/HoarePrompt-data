Output State: **The program returns the absolute difference between y2 and y1, which is t.**

Given the conditions:
- `t` is calculated as `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- The condition `(b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c and (1 <= y1 <= m) and (1 <= x1 <= n))` is true, but it does not affect the direct calculation of `t`.

Therefore, the program returns `t`, which is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
