Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[3] < clues[5]` does not hold, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
