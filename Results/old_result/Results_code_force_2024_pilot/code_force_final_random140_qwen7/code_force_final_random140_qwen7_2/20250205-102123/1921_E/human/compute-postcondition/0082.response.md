Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using spaces, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` minus `a`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `c` is `y2 - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y2 - 1` to `c`. Since `y2` is the sixth element of `r` minus `a`, `c` is calculated as `(r[5] - a) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
