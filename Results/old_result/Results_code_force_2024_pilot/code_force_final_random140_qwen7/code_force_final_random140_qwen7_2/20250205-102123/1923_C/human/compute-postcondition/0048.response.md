Output State: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is unchanged, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the integer entered first, `r` is the integer entered second, and we continue the loop if `l != r`.**

Explanation: The code updates `onesInRange` to the value of `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for continuing the loop is that `l` should not be equal to `r`, which remains unchanged from the initial state.
