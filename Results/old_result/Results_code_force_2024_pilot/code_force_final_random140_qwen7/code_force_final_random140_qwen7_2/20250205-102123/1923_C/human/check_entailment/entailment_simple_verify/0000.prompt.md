You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case contains two integers n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.

    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`; `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` where the value is 1; `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of the number 1s up to each index, and the `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')

            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` where the value is 1, `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `q` is `0`, and `l` and `r` are the last values entered by the user during the loop's final iteration. The `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` variables are calculated based on these final `l` and `r` values but do not affect the overall state since the loop has completed.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of the number 1s up to each index, and the `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index. The variable `q` will be `0` because it starts with a positive value and is decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values from the last input pair processed by the loop. The `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` calculations are performed using these final `l` and `r` values but do not change the overall state since the loop has ended.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that satisfies the conditions, but it does not properly account for the requirement that `b_i > 0` for every index `i`. 

For example, consider the subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` from the provided test case. The program incorrectly prints "YES" for the subarray from index 1 to 3 (`[1, 2, 1]`), which is not a good subarray because we cannot transform it into another array `b` where all elements are positive and distinct from the original elements. A correct transformation would require that the sum of the subarray remains the same, and all elements in `b` are positive and different from the corresponding elements in the subarray. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the transformed array `b` will satisfy these conditions.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where all elements are positive and distinct from the original elements, and the sum of the subarray remains unchanged. This requires a more complex logic to verify the conditions for a good subarray.
