Output State: **`i` is 3, `ones[3]` is `ones[2]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0) + (1 if `nums[1]` == 1 else 0), `sum[3]` is `sum[2]` + `nums[1]`, `sum[3]` is updated to `sum[3] + nums[2]`**

Explanation: The code updates `sum[i]` to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, this translates to updating `sum[3]` to `sum[2] + nums[2]`. The values of `i`, `ones[3]`, and `sum[3]` remain as per their initial definitions, just with `sum[3]` now explicitly defined as `sum[3] + nums[2]`.
