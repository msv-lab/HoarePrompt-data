Output State: `i` is `n`; `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` where the value is 1; `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of the number 1s up to each index, and the `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index.
