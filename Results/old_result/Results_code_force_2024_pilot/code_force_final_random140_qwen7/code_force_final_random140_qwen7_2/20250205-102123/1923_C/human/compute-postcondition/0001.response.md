Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
