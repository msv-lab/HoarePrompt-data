### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and the provided function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes variables for each test case.
   - It reads the length `n` of the array `c` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `nums` which represents the subarray `c`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Two arrays `ones` and `sum` are initialized to store cumulative counts and sums respectively.
   - `ones[i]` stores the count of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums`.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r` representing the subarray.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, so it prints "NO" because a single element cannot satisfy the condition of having different elements in `a` and `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum (`sumInRange`) in the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - It checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds.
     - Simplifying the left side: \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} = \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1)\).
     - This condition checks if the number of 1s plus the remaining elements (which must be greater than 1) can sum up to the total sum of the subarray.

#### Correctness Check

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition \( \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange} \) ensures that the subarray can be split into two parts where one part contains all 1s and the other part contains numbers greater than 1.
   - If the condition holds, it means we can construct a valid array `b` where all elements are greater than 0 and different from the corresponding elements in `a`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element by printing "NO".
   - The preprocessing step ensures that the cumulative counts and sums are calculated efficiently.

3. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on a given array. It first constructs cumulative counts and sums for the array elements. Then, for each query, it checks if a specific condition is met based on the subarray defined by the query indices. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries.

#### Conclusion

Upon re-evaluating the program and the function summary, the logic and implementation appear to be correct. The program correctly preprocesses the array to calculate cumulative counts and sums and then uses these values to check the condition for each query.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
