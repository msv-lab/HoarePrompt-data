Postcondition: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input. If the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange)` is satisfied, then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.**
