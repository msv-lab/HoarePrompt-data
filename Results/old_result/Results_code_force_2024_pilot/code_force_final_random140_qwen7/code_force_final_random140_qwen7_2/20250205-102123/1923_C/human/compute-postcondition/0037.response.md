Output State: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are updated to the values entered by the user, separated by a space, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `onesInRange` to the value of `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. This does not affect `sumInRange`, `q`, `l`, or `r`. The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the values entered by the user, and the condition that `q` is greater than 0 and the loop continues remains unchanged.
