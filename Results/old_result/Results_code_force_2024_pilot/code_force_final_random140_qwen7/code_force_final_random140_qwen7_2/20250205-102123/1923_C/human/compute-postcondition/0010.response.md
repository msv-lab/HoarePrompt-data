Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ones[2]` is calculated based on the previous values.
   - `sum[2]` is updated based on the previous values.

4. **Calculate the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `i` is now 3, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

6. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `ones[3]` is `ones[2]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0) + (1 if `nums[1]` == 1 else 0), `sum[3]` is `sum[2]` + `nums[1]`**
