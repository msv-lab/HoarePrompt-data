You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case contains two integers n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`; `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` where the value is 1; `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of the number 1s up to each index, and the `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` where the value is 1, `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `q` is `0`, and `l` and `r` are the last values entered by the user during the loop's final iteration. The `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` variables are calculated based on these final `l` and `r` values but do not affect the overall state since the loop has completed.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of the number 1s up to each index, and the `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index. The variable `q` will be `0` because it starts with a positive value and is decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values from the last input pair processed by the loop. The `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` calculations are performed using these final `l` and `r` values but do not change the overall state since the loop has ended.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. For each query, it calculates and returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index l_i to r_i inclusive.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
