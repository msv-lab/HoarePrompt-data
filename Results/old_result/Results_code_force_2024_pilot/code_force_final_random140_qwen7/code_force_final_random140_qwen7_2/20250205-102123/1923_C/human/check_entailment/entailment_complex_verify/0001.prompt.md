You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case contains two integers n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]

    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`; `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` where the value is 1; `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of the number 1s up to each index, and the `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]

            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `ones[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` where the value is 1, `sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `q` is `0`, and `l` and `r` are the last values entered by the user during the loop's final iteration. The `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` variables are calculated based on these final `l` and `r` values but do not affect the overall state since the loop has completed.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of the number 1s up to each index, and the `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index. The variable `q` will be `0` because it starts with a positive value and is decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values from the last input pair processed by the loop. The `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` calculations are performed using these final `l` and `r` values but do not change the overall state since the loop has ended.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of queries on a given array. It first constructs cumulative counts and sums for the array elements. Then, for each query, it checks if a specific condition is met based on the subarray defined by the query indices. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `c` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` which represents the subarray `c`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Two arrays `ones` and `sum` are initialized to store cumulative counts and sums respectively.
   - `ones[i]` stores the count of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums`.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r` representing the subarray.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, so it prints "NO" because a single element cannot satisfy the condition of having different elements in `a` and `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum (`sumInRange`) in the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - It checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds.
     - Simplifying the left side: \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} = \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1)\).
     - This condition checks if the number of 1s plus the remaining elements (which must be greater than 1) can sum up to the total sum of the subarray.

### Correctness Check

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition \( \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange} \) ensures that the subarray can be split into two parts where one part contains all 1s and the other part contains numbers greater than 1.
   - If the condition holds, it means we can construct a valid array `b` where all elements are greater than 0 and different from the corresponding elements in `a`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element by printing "NO".
   - The preprocessing step ensures that the cumulative counts and sums are calculated efficiently.

### Conclusion

The program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately. It preprocesses the array to calculate cumulative counts and sums, and then uses these values to check the condition for each query.

Correctness: **True**
