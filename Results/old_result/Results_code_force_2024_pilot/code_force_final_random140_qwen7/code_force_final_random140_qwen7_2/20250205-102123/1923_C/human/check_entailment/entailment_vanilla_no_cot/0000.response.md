Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`:**
   - The code calculates `onesInRange` as the count of 1s in the subarray from `l` to `r`. However, it should calculate the count of 1s in the entire subarray directly without using the `ones` array.
   - Similarly, `sumInRange` is calculated as the sum of elements in the subarray from `l` to `r`, which is correct but unnecessary for determining if the subarray is good.

2. **Condition for Subarray to be Good:**
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is incorrect. According to the problem, for a subarray to be good, the sum of the subarray must be equal to the sum of another array where each element is different and positive. This means the sum of the subarray must be even, and the number of distinct elements must be at least as many as the number of elements in the subarray minus the number of 1s.

3. **Simpler Approach:**
   - A simpler approach would be to check if the sum of the subarray is even and if the number of distinct elements in the subarray is at least as many as the number of elements in the subarray minus the number of 1s.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        subarray_sum = sum(nums[l-1:r])
        distinct_elements = len(set(nums[l-1:r]))
        if subarray_sum % 2 == 0 and distinct_elements >= (r - l + 1) - nums[l-1:r].count(1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version checks if the sum of the subarray is even and if the number of distinct elements is sufficient to make the subarray good.
