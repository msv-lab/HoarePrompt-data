Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list named `sum` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `nums`, and `ones`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
