Output State: **`i` is 1; `ones[1]` is `ones[0]` + (1 if `nums[0]` == 1 else 0)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ones[i]` based on the value of `ones[i-1]` and the condition involving `nums[i-1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ones[i]` which is `ones[1]` is set to `ones[0] + (1 if nums[0] == 1 else 0)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `ones[0]` and `nums[0]`, the output state reflects this dependency. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains valid but is not directly impacted by the given code snippet.
