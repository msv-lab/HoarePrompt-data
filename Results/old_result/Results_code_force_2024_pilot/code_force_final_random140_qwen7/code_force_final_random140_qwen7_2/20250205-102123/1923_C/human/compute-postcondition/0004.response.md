Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The objects involved here are `i`, `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other objects in the program state**:
   - `t` is a positive integer, but it is not part of the loop head.
   - `q` is an input integer, but it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nums` is a list of integers, but it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ones` is a list of `n+1` zeros, but it is not part of the loop head.
   - `sum` is a list of `n+1` zeros, but it is not part of the loop head.

Since none of these other objects affect the loop's execution, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are related to `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
