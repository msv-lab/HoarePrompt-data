Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]` appended to it.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(a))`, the loop will continue if `i` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1`, meaning `i` was at the upper bound of its previous range (i.e., `i` was `len(a) - 1`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again, so `i` will be `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `ad` will have another element appended, which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. Since `i` will be `len(a)`, the next element to be appended will be `a[len(a)] - a[len(a) - 1]`.
   - `i` will be `len(a)`.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[len(a)] - a[len(a) - 1]` appended to it, `i` is `len(a)`, and `len(a)` remains unchanged**.
