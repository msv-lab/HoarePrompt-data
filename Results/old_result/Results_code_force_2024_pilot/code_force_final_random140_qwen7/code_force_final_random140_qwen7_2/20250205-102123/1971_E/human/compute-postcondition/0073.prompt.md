Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `v` will contain the values of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each iteration of the loop from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(b) + 1` after all iterations of the loop have completed. This means `v` will have `len(a) - 1` elements, as the loop runs `len(a) - 1` times, appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to `v` in each iteration. The condition that `len(b) + 1` must be within the range 1 to `len(a) - 1` must hold true for the loop to execute.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the list `v` will have `len(a) - 1` elements, each being the result of dividing the corresponding element in `ad` by the corresponding element in `bd`. The variable `i` will be set to `len(b) + 1` after the loop finishes.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` is `m + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]))`, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer converted to an integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is `m + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the position where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
