Output State: **`bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. The value of `b` remains unchanged, and `i` is updated to `i + 2`. Therefore, the new element added to `bd` is specifically `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, while `b` and `i` retain their previous values.
