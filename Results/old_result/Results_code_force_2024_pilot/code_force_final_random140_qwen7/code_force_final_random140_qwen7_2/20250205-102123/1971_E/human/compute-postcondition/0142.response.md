Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `m` is incremented by the value of `b[s - 1]`. Since the initial value of `m` was 0, after executing `m += b[s - 1]`, the value of `m` becomes `b[s - 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, and `ql`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
