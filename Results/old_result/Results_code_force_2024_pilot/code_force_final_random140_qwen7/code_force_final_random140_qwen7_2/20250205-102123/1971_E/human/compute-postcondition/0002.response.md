Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and now `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values provided by the user.
