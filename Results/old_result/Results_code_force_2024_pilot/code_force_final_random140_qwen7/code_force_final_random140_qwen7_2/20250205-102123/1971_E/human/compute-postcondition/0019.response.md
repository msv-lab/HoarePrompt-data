Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(b))`. The key variables here are `i` and `b`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `bd` is a list with two elements where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]` and the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i < len(b)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `bd` will be updated based on the new value of `i`. Specifically, the list `bd` will now contain `b[2] - b[1]` as its first element and `b[4] - b[3]` as its second element (if `len(b)` is at least 5).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 4
- `bd` is a list with two elements where the first element is `b[2] - b[1]` and the second element is `b[4] - b[3]`

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `i` is 4, `bd` is a list with two elements where the first element is `b[2] - b[1]` and the second element is `b[4] - b[3]`**
