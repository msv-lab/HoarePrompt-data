Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from user input; `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers input by the user; `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `b` which starts with 0 and is followed by integers obtained from user input using `input().split()`. The `map(int, ...)` function converts each element in the split input to an integer. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged.
