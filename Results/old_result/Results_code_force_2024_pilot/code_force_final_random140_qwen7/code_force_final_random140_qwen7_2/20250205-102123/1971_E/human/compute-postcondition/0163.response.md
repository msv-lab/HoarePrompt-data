Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b` and `i` retain their previous values.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for i in range(1, len(b)):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `len(b) - 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.
   - `b` and `i` retain their previous values.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`.
   - Since `i` was previously `i`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop can continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `len(b)`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `bd` will get another element, which will be `b[i + 1] - b[i]`.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

### Final State:
- `bd` will have a new element `b[i + 1] - b[i]`.
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `b` retains its previous value.

### Updated State:
State: **`bd` has a new element which is `b[i + 1] - b[i]`, `b` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 1`**
