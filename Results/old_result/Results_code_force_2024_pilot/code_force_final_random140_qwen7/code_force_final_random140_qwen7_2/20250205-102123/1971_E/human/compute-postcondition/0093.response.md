Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(b)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `len(b)` must be greater than 1
   - `ad` is an empty list
   - `bd` is a list containing the values `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]`

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Given `i` is currently 2, `len(b)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `len(b)` remains unchanged, but it must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`i` is 3, `len(b)` must be greater than 2, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the values `[b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1]]`**
