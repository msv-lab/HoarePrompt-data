Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for l in range(q)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `l` is 1
   - `m` is `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]) + b[s - 1]`
   - `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `q`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `l` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `l` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `q` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `m` is calculated based on the updated `ql` but since `ql` is not directly modified by the loop, it remains the same.
   - `ql` is updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from its previous value, but since no further information about `a[s - 1]` or `ql` is given, we assume `ql` remains as it is unless otherwise specified.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]) + b[s - 1]`, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`**
