Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` by adding `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` to the current value of `m`. Here, `m` was initially `b[s - 1]`, `ql` was reduced by the value of `a[s - 1]`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.
