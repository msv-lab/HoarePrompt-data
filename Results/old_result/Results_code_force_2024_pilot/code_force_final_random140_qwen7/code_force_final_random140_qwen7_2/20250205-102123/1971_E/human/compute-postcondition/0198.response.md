Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `i`, `l`, and `m` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
