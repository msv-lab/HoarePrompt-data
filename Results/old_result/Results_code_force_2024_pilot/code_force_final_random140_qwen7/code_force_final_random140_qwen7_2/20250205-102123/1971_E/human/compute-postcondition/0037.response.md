Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` assigns the value of the leftmost insertion point of `ql` in the list `a` (which maintains the sorted order) to the variable `s`. The other variables (`m`, `q`, `i`, `len(b)`, and `ql`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
