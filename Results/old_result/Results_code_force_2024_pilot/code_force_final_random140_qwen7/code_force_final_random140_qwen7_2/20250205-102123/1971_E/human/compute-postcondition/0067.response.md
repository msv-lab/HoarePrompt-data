Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the position where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 3 and we continue the loop or iteration we were inside.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
