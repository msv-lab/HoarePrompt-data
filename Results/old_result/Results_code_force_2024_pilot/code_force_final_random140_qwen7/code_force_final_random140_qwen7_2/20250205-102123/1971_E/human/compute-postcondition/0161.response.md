Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used as the index in the `range` function.
   - `len(b)`: This is the upper limit of the range function.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will start with `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - The value of `len(b)` should be such that there are at least two elements in the list `b` (since the loop starts from index 1).

3. **Consider the Final State of `ad`**:
   - After the loop completes, `ad` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of the list `a` from index 1 to the length of `a` minus 1.
   - This implies that `ad` will have a length of `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and that `len(b)` is large enough to allow the loop to run through all necessary iterations.
   - Since `a` is not directly involved in the loop head, its initial state does not need to be adjusted here. However, we know that `a` must have at least two elements for the loop to produce the correct output for `ad`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `len(b)` should be set to a value that ensures the loop runs through all necessary iterations (i.e., `len(b) >= 2`).

Since the problem does not specify the exact initial values of `b`, we can assume that `b` has at least two elements, ensuring the loop can execute correctly.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `len(b)` must be at least 2**
