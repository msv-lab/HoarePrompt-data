Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `l` and `q`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `l < q`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `l` is 0
   - `m` is `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]) + b[s - 1]`
   - `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `l` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `l < q`, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `l` becomes 1.
   - `q` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `l` becomes 1.
   - `m` and `ql` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]) + b[s - 1]`, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`**
