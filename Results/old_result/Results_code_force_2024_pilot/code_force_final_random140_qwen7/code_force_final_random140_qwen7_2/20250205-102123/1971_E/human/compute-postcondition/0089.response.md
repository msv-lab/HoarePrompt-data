Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (as specified by `range(1, len(b))`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(b)` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and that the condition `i < len(b)` holds true for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the Final State of `i`**: After the loop completes, `i` should be equal to `len(b)`. However, since the loop increments `i` within its body, the initial value of `i` must be such that it reaches `len(b)` after the loop ends. Given the loop starts at 1 and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the loop will run `len(b) - 1` times, making the final value of `i` equal to `len(b) + 1 - 1 = len(b)`.

6. **List `ad`**: The list `ad` is constructed during the loop, but its initial state is not directly relevant to the loop's execution. We only need to ensure that the loop can run as expected.

7. **Length of `a`**: The length of `a` remains unchanged and must be greater than `len(b) + 1`.

Based on these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` must be 1.
- `len(b)` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `i < len(b)`).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `len(b)` must be greater than 1, `ad` is an empty list, and `len(a)` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(b) + 1`**.
