Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `ql -= a[s - 1]` subtracts the value of `a[s - 1]` from `ql`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `a[s - 1]`, we represent the new value of `ql` as `ql - a[s - 1]`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `m` remain unchanged.
