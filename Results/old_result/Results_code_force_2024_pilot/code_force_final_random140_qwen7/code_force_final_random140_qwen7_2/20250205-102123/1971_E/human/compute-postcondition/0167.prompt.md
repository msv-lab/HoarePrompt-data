Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ad` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of the list `a` from index 1 to the length of `a` minus 1.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ad` will be a list containing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a`, starting from the second element of `a` (index 1) up to the last element. The length of `ad` will be one less than the length of `a`. All other variables (`i`, `l`, `bd`, `m`, `ql`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `s`) will retain their values as they were after the third iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b` and `i` retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
