Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, len(b)):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `bd` is a list with two elements where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]` and the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < len(b)`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`, so `i` will be `4`.

5. **Determine the new state of `bd`**:
   - The list `bd` is constructed based on the values in `b`.
   - After the previous iteration, `bd` contains `[b[1] - b[0], b[3] - b[2]]`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `4`, so the next element to consider in `bd` would be `b[4] - b[3]`.
   - Therefore, `bd` will now contain `[b[1] - b[0], b[3] - b[2], b[4] - b[3]]`.

6. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(b)`.
   - If `len(b)` is at least `5`, the loop can continue.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 4.
- `bd` is a list with three elements: `[b[1] - b[0], b[3] - b[2], b[4] - b[3]]`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 4, `bd` is a list with three elements: `[b[1] - b[0], b[3] - b[2], b[4] - b[3]]`**
