Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `len(b) + 1`
   - `ad` is `[a[i] - a[i - 1]]`
   - `len(a)` must be greater than `len(b) + 1`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, len(a)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(b) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` was `len(b) + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `len(b) + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The length of `a` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - The list `ad` is updated based on the new value of `i`.

5. **New State:**
   - `i` is now `len(b) + 2`
   - `ad` is updated to `[a[i] - a[i - 1]]`, where `i` is now `len(b) + 2`.
   - `len(a)` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(b) + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `len(b) + 2`, `ad` is `[a[len(b) + 2] - a[len(b) + 1]]`, `len(a)` must be greater than `len(b) + 1`**
