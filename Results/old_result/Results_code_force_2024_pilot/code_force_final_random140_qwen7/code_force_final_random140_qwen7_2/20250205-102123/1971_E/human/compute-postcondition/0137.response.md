To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is 2.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`. 

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(b[s], end=' ')`

From the initial state, we know the values of `i`, `l`, and `m`, but we need more information about `a` and `ql` to determine the value of `s`. Since these details are not provided, we cannot explicitly determine the value of `s`.

However, we can still describe the output in a general form based on the information given:

- `b[s]` refers to the element in the list `b` at the index specified by `s`.

Given that `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, it means `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in the sorted list `a`. This means `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]` if `s` is within the bounds of `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `ql` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `s` and hence `b[s]`.

Therefore, the output will be the element in the list `b` at the index `s`, where `s` is determined by the `bisect_left` function.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the result of bisect_left(a, ql))**
