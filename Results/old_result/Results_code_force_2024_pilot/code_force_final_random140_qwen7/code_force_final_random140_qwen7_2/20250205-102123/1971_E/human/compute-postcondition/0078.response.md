Output State: **`v` contains `len(a) - 1` elements, each being the result of dividing the corresponding element in `ad` by the corresponding element in `bd`, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is updated to include 0 followed by integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is `[0]` followed by integers inputted separated by spaces.**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- It then prepends a `0` to this list, resulting in `b` being `[0]` followed by the integers inputted.
- All other variables (`v`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
