Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. The current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
