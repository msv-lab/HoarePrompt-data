Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is 2.
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(m, end=' ')` will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

To determine the value of `m`, we need to know the values of `b`, `bd`, `a`, `ql`, and `ad`. Since these values are not provided in the initial state, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can describe it based on the formula given.

The value of `m` is calculated as:
\[ m = b[s - 1] + \left( \frac{bd[s] \times (ql - a[s - 1])}{ad[s]} \right) \]

Given this, the output will be the value of `m` described by the formula above.

Output: **b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]**
