Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `m` is updated by adding the result of `bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` to its current value `b[s - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `m` now holds the value of `b[s - 1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s] * ql` by `ad[s]`.
