Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `len(b)` must be greater than 1.
   - `ad` is an empty list.
   - `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.
   - `len(a)` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(b) + 1`.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - `len(b)` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **State After the Adjustment:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `len(b)` must still be greater than 1.
   - `ad` remains an empty list.
   - `bd` remains a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.
   - `len(a)` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(b) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `len(b)` must be greater than 1, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`, and `len(a)` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(b) + 1`**.
