Let's break down the initial state and the expression for `m` step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is 1.
   - `ql` is some value (its exact value is not provided, but it will be used in the calculation).
   - `b[s-1]` is some value (its exact value is not provided, but it will be used in the calculation).
   - `bd[s]` is some value (its exact value is not provided, but it will be used in the calculation).
   - `a[s-1]` is some value (its exact value is not provided, but it will be used in the calculation).
   - `b[s]` is some value (its exact value is not provided, but it will be used in the calculation).

2. **Expression for `m`:**
   \[
   m = bd[s] \times (ql // ad[s]) + b[s-1]
   \]
   Here, `ad[s]` is not explicitly defined, so we'll assume it's a variable that exists and is used in the division operation.

3. **Calculation of `m`:**
   - First, calculate `ql // ad[s]`. This is integer division, so it will give the quotient of `ql` divided by `ad[s]`.
   - Then, multiply the result by `bd[s]`.
   - Finally, add `b[s-1]` to the result of the multiplication.

Given the above, let's express the output:

Output: **bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]) + b[s-1]**
