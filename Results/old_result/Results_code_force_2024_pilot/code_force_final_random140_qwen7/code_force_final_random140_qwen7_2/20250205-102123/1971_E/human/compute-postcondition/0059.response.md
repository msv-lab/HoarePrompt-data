Output State: **`m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer converted to an integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
