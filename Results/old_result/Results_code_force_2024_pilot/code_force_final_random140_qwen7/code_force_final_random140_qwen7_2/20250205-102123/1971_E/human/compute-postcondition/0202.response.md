Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `ql` is reduced by the value of `a[s - 1]`**.

The value of `m` is incremented by `b[s - 1]`. Since the initial value of `m` was 0, the new value of `m` is `b[s - 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, and `ql`) remain unchanged, with `ql` being reduced by the value of `a[s - 1]` as mentioned in the initial state.
