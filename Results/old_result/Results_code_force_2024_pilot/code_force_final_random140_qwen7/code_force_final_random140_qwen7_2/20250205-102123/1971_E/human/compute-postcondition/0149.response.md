Output State: **`i` is 4, `l` is 3, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]`, `ql` is 0, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `q` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with a leading zero followed by integers entered by the user using `map(int, input().split())`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, `n`, `k`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
