Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `s` is bisect_left(a, ql)**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and no changes to the variables were made within the statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the same values as the initial state.
