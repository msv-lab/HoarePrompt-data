Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i < len(a)`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to add an element to `ad`.
   - The next value of `i` should be `i + 1` to satisfy the condition `i < len(a)`.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged because it is a property of the list `a` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Construct the New State:**
   - `ad` will have another element added in the next iteration, which will be `a[i+1] - a[i]`.
   - `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - `len(a)` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `len(a)` remains unchanged**.
