Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0**

Explanation: The line `i = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. However, since `i` was already 1 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The values of `l`, `m`, and `ql` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state remains as described.
