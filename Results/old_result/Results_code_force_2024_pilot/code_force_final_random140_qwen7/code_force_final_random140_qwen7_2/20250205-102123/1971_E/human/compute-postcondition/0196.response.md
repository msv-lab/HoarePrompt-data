Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` assigns the value of `bisect_left(a, ql)` to the variable `s`. Here, `a` is not defined in the initial state, and `ql` is an input integer. Since `a` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. However, we know that `s` will be the leftmost index where `ql` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `m` remain unchanged.
