Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `bd` is a list with one element which is `b[1] - b[0]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3 (since the loop starts from 1).
   - The value of `bd` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop variable `i`.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect the updated value of `i` and maintain the current state of `bd`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 3, `bd` is a list with one element which is `b[1] - b[0]`**
