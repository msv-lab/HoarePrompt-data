Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and it ranges from `1` to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
   - This means that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `current_i - 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, if `i` was `current_i - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `current_i`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `current_i` must be less than `len(a)`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ad` will have a new element which is `a[current_i] - a[current_i - 1]`.
   - `i` will be `current_i`.

Given that `i` was `current_i - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `current_i`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[current_i] - a[current_i - 1]`, `i` is `current_i`**.
