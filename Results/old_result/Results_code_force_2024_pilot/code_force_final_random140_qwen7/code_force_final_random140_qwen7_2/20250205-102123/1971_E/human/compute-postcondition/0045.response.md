Output State: **`m` is 0 + `b[s - 1]`, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be such that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep `a` sorted, `ql` is an input integer, and `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1].**

In natural language: The value of `m` is updated to be its original value (0) plus the value of `b[s - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
