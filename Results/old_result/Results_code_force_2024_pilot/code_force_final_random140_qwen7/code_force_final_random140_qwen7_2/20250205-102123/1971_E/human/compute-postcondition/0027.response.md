Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved here are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` contains the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.
   - `len(b) + 1` must be within the range 1 to `len(a)` - 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Analyze the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the valid range.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, if the previous `i` was `k`, the new `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The condition `len(b) + 1` must still be within the range 1 to `len(a)` - 1.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- The previous `i` was within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `i + 1`.
- The condition `len(b) + 1` must still hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`v` contains the value of `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`, `len(b) + 1` must be within the range 1 to `len(a)` - 1**.
