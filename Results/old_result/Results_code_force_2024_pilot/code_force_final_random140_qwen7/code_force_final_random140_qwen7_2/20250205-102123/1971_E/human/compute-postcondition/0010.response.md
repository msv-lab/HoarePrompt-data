Output State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, and `len(a)` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The length of the list `a` remains unchanged. All other variables and their states remain the same as the initial state.
