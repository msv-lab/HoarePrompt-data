Output State: **`i` is 3, `bd` is a list with two elements where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]` and the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3 and `bd` is a list containing one element, which is `b[1] - b[0]`. The code snippet appends `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Since `i` is 3, `b[i]` refers to `b[3]` and `b[i - 1]` refers to `b[2]`. Therefore, the new element appended to `bd` is `b[3] - b[2]`. The updated list `bd` now contains two elements: `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[3] - b[2]`.
