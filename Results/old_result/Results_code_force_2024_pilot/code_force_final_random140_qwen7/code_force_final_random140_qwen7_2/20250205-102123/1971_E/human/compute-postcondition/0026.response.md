Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `v` contains the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.
   - `len(b) + 1` must be within the range 1 to `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `2` (assuming `i` was `1` in the previous iteration).

5. **Adjust the State of `v`**: The value of `v` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`, which is now `2`. So, `v` will contain the value of `ad[2] / bd[2]`.

6. **Adjust the Range Constraint**: The condition `len(b) + 1` must still be within the range 1 to `len(a) - 1`. Since this condition does not depend on `i`, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `v` contains the value of `ad[2] / bd[2]`, `len(b) + 1` must be within the range 1 to `len(a) - 1`**
