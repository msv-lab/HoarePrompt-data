Output State: **`i` is 4, `l` is 3, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) // ad[s]`, `ql` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `l`, `m`, and `ql`) remain unchanged. Since the input values for `n`, `k`, and `q` are not specified, they are left as "integers entered by the user."
