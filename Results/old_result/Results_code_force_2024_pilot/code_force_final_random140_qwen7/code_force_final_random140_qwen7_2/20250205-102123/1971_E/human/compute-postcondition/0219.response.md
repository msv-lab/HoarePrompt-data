Output State: `i` is 1, `l` is `q-1`, `m` is the final accumulated value of `m` after all iterations of the loop.

Explanation: The loop runs `q` times as defined by the variable `q`. After all iterations, the value of `l` will be `q-1` because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `i` remains 1 throughout the loop as it is only initialized and not modified within the loop body. The variable `m` accumulates its value based on the operations performed inside the loop for each iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `m` will hold the final computed value after processing all inputs up to `q-1`.
