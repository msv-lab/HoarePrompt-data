Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `m` is reassigned the value `0`. The values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. The expression for `m` originally was `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, but since `m` is now explicitly set to `0`, this expression no longer applies.
