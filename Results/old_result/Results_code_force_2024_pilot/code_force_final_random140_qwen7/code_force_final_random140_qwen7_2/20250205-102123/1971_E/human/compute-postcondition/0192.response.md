Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `l`, which ranges from `0` to `q-1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `l` is 0 (since it's the end of the previous iteration, `l` would have been incremented from 0)
   - `m` is `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < q`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `l` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `l` will be 1.
   - There is no change needed for `i` since it is not part of the loop head.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged because it is computed outside the loop and does not depend on the loop variable `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + b[s - 1]`**
