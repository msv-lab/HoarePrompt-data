Output State: **`bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `b` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. The values of `b` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The new element added to `bd` is specifically the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i - 1]`.
