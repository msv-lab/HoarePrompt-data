Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` to become `ql - a[s - 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `m` is incremented by the value of `b[s - 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, and `ql`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `m` now holds the value of `b[s - 1]`, while `i`, `l`, and `ql` retain their original values.
