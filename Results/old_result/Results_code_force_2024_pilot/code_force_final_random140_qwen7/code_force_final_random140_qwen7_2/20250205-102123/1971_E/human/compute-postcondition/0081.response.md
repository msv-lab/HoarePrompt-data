Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is given as `len(b) + 1`.
   - `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, len(a)):` will start from `1` and go up to `len(a) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `len(b) + 1`, we need to ensure that `len(b) + 1` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`.
   - This means `len(b) + 1` should be less than `len(a)`, because `len(a) - 1` is the upper limit of the range.

5. **Consider the other given states**:
   - The states of `v`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` are not directly relevant to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(b) + 1` should be less than `len(a)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `len(b) + 1`, `len(a)` must be greater than `len(b) + 1`**
