Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the condition used to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Specifically, the condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:` is incorrect.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Condition `n <= k`:**
   - If `n` (the number of parts) is less than or equal to `k` (the number of parts Bob can repaint), then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Therefore, this should result in "NO" because Alice cannot prevent Bob from achieving his goal.
   
2. **Condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`:**
   - This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be repainted to ensure all parts have different colors is within the limit `k`. However, this is not the correct approach. Instead, we need to check if the number of unique colors used by Alice is more than what Bob can repaint.

To correctly solve the problem, the logic should be:
- If `m > k`, then Alice can use more than `k` different colors, making it impossible for Bob to repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Hence, the answer should be "YES".
- Otherwise, the answer should be "NO".

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if m > k:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This version correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
