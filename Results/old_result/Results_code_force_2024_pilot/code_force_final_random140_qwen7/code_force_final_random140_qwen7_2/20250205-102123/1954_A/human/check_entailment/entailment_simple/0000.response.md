Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
3. The logic checks whether it's possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
4. The condition `n <= k` checks if Bob can already achieve his goal with his allowed repainting operations.
5. The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` checks if even after Alice paints the ribbon with the maximum diversity (i.e., using `math.ceil(n / m)` different colors), Bob still cannot make all parts the same color with his allowed repainting operations.
6. If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
7. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
8. The program handles all given examples correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
