Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `k` is the third integer input.
- The condition either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k` holds true.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Given the condition, it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement because the condition is used to determine the logic leading up to this point but does not influence the output of the `print` statement itself. Therefore, regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, the `print` statement will always output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
