Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `k` is the third integer input.
- `itest` is assigned the value of `t`.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the code does not depend on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `itest`, and only prints a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **'NO'**
