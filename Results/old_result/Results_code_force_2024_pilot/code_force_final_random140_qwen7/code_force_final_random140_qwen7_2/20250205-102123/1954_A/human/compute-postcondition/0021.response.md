Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of three positive integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (t being the number of test cases). It returns different values based on the relationships between n, m, and k for each test case.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters when called, instead, it seems to handle multiple sets of inputs (test cases) internally, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k, and returns outputs based on the conditions specified.
