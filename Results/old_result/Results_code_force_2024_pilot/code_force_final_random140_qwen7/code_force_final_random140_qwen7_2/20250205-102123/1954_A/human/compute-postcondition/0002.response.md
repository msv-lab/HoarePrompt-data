Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, and `k` is the third integer input.**

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
