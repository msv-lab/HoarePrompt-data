Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `itest` is equal to `t`. For each iteration of the loop, if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After all iterations, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `itest` equals `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations without any modifications to these variables.
