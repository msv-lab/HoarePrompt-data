Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `itest` is equal to `t`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, the condition holds true, resulting in 'NO' being printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged after the loop completes.
