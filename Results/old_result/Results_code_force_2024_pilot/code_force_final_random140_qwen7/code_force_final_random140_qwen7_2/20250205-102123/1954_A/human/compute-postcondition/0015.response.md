Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `itest` is `t`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. It does not affect the values of `t` and `itest`. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `itest` is still equal to `t`.
