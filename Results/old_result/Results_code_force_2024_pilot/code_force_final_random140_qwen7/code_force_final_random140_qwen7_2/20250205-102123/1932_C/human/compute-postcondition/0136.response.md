Postcondition: `i` is `n - 5`, `k` is updated according to the condition in the if statement. If `t[i] == 'R'`, then `k` is updated as `k * a[q2] % m * a[q2] % m` with `q2` increased by 1, and `y` is a string containing a space followed by the value of the updated `k` converted to a string, and `q2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m`, `y` is a string containing a space followed by the value of the updated `k` converted to a string, and `q1` is decreased by 1.
