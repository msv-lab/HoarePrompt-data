Output State: **`k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the element `t[i]` is not 'R'; `q1` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `q1` is decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions or relationships. Therefore, `k` remains as `k * a[q1] % m`, `i` becomes `n - 3` (since `i` was originally `n - 2`), and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and that `t[i]` is not 'R' still holds true.
