Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, `q1` and `q2` are defined based on the last character of `t` and adjusted during the loop, and `y` is a string containing the space-separated representations of all `k` values updated in each iteration, `a` is updated to be the list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The other variables (`ii`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
