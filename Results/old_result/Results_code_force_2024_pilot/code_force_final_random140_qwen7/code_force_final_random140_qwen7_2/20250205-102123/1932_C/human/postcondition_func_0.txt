The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), a list of \(n\) integers \(a\), and a string \(t\) consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It calculates a value \(k\) based on the last character of \(t\) and the elements of \(a\). Then, it iterates through \(t\) from the second last character to the first, updating \(k\) according to the direction indicated by 'L' or 'R'. Finally, it prints a space-separated string of the intermediate values of \(k\) for each character in \(t\), in reverse order.
