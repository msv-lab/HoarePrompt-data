Postcondition: `i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `k` is updated as either `k * a[q2] % m * a[q2] % m` (if `t[i]` equals 'R') or `k * a[q1] % m` (otherwise), `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` does not equal 'R', `q2` is increased by 1 if `t[i]` equals 'R', and `y` is a string containing a space followed by the value of the updated `k` converted to a string.
