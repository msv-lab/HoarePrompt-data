Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations.
   - `q1` is `l - 1`.
   - `q2` is `l`.
   - `y` is a string containing spaces followed by the value of `k` converted to a string for each iteration.
   - `ii` is `0`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(y[::-1])
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the content of `y`. Since `y` is described as a string containing spaces followed by the value of `k` converted to a string for each iteration, let's assume the iterations and the values of `k` for those iterations.

Given no specific iterations or values for `k` are provided, we can infer that `y` would be constructed during some loop where `k` takes on different values. For simplicity, let's assume the following iterations (though the actual values depend on the loop logic):

- Suppose `k` takes the values `1, 2, 3` in three iterations.

Then `y` would be constructed as follows:
- In the first iteration, `y` would be `" 1 "`.
- In the second iteration, `y` would be `" 1 2 "`.
- In the third iteration, `y` would be `" 1 2 3 "`.

So, `y` would be `" 1 2 3 "` after all iterations.

When we reverse this string using `y[::-1]`, it becomes `"3 2 1 "`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **"3 2 1 "**
