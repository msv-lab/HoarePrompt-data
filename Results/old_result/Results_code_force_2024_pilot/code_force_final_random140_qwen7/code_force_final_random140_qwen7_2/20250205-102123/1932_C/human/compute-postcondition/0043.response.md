Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `k` is updated based on the last character of `t`, `q1` and `q2` are defined based on the last character of `t`, `y` is `y` plus a space followed by the string representation of `k * a[q2] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'R', or `k * a[q1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', and `i` is greater than or equal to `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'R', or less than `-1` if the last character of `t` is 'L'.**
