Output State: **`i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1, `q2` is increased by 1 if `t[i]` is 'R', `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2-1] % m` or `k` converted to a string, and `y` is updated by adding a space followed by the current value of `k` converted to a string.**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decreases the value of `q1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `q1` being decreased by 1, while `i`, `k`, `q2`, and `y` retain their initial conditions described in the initial state.
