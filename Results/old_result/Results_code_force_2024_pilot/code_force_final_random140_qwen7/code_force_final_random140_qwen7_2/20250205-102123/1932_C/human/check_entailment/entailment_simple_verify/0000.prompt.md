You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the array `a` based on the commands in the string `t`. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the initial value of `k` and the indices `q1` and `q2` for the first operation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Initial Value of `k`:**
   - The program calculates the initial value of `k` using the count of 'L' characters (`l`). This approach is flawed because it does not consider the actual sequence of commands.
   - For example, in the test case `LRRL`, the program would incorrectly set `k` to `a[l-1] % m` or `a[l] % m` based on the last character of the string `t`. However, the correct initial value of `k` should be calculated based on the first command in the string `t`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `q1` and `q2`:**
   - The indices `q1` and `q2` are set based on the last character of the string `t`, which is incorrect. These indices should be determined based on the first command in the string `t`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
```
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```
- The correct sequence of operations should be:
  1. Calculate the product of all elements modulo `m`: `3 * 1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 0`.
  2. Since the first command is 'L', remove the leftmost element: `[1, 4, 2]`.
  3. Calculate the product of the remaining elements modulo `m`: `1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 2`.
  4. Since the second command is 'R', remove the rightmost element: `[1, 4]`.
  5. Calculate the product of the remaining elements modulo `m`: `1 * 4 % 6 = 4`.
  6. Since the third command is 'R', remove the rightmost element: `[1]`.
  7. Calculate the product of the remaining elements modulo `m`: `1 % 6 = 1`.
  8. Since the fourth command is 'L', remove the leftmost element: `[]`.

However, the program incorrectly handles this sequence, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
