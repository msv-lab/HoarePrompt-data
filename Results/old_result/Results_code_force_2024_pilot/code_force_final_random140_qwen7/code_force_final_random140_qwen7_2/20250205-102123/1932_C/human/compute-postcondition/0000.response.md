Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `ii` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ii`**: The loop will start with `ii` being set to the value of `int(input())`. This means that `ii` will take the value of an integer input from the user.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `ii` is greater than 0. Since `t` (which is the value of `int(input())`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `ii` is initialized to a valid value that will allow the loop to execute. Given that `t` is the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` (or equivalently `ii`), ensuring it is a positive integer within the given range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
