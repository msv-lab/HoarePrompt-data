Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `q1`, `q2`, `t`, and `y`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n - 2` to `i = -1` in reverse order (decrementing by 1 each time).

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n - 3` or `n - 4`.
   - **Variable `k`**: The value of `k` is updated based on the character `t[i]`. Depending on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not, `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m`. This update does not depend on the loop counter `i`, so `k` remains the same.
   - **Variable `y`**: The value of `y` is a string containing a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string. Since `k` remains unchanged, `y` also remains the same.

4. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop.
   - **Variables `a`, `q1`, `q2`, and `t`**: These variables are not modified within the loop and remain the same.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment are `i`, `k`, and `y`.

**Final State**:
- `i` will be `n - 3` or `n - 4` (depending on the previous value).
- `k` remains the same.
- `y` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m` depending on whether `t[i]` equals 'R' or not, `y` is a string containing a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string**.
