Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is either `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `y` is a string representation of `k`, and `i` must be less than `-1`
