Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 2, -1, -1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value and Range of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n - 2`.
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches -1.
   - Therefore, `i` will take values from `n - 2` down to 0 (inclusive).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to `n - 2`.
   - The value of `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute (since `i` starts at `n - 2` and goes down to -1).

4. **Consider Other Relevant Variables:**
   - The other variables (`k`, `q1`, `q2`, `y`, `m`, `a`, `l`, `t`, `ii`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `n - 2`.
- `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be at least 2**
