Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an integer, `ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`, `q1` is either `l - 2` or `l - 1`, `q2` is either `l` or `l + 1`, `y` is a string representation of `k`, `t` is the input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y += ' ' + str(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 2`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m`, depending on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is either `n-4` or `n-3`, `k` is updated to either `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m` depending on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `q2` is increased by 1 if `t[i]` is 'R', `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2-1] % m` or `k` converted to a string, `y` is updated by adding a space followed by the current value of `k` converted to a string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `k` is updated to either `k * a[q1] % m` or `k * a[q2] % m` depending on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `q2` is increased by 1 if `t[i]` is 'R', `y` is a string that now includes a space followed by the value of `k` converted to a string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
