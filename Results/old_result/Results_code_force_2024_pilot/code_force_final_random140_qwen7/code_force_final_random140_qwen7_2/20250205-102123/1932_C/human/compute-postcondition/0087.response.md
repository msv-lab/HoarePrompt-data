Output State: **`i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `q2` is increased by 1, `y` is a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2-1] % m` or `k` converted to a string, and `y` is updated by adding a space followed by the current value of `k` converted to a string.**

Explanation: The line `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains either `n-5` or `n-4`, `k` remains updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1 if `t[i]` is not 'R', `q2` is now increased by 1, `y` remains a string that includes a space followed by the value of `k * a[q2-1] % m` or `k` converted to a string, and `y` is updated by adding a space followed by the current value of `k` converted to a string.
