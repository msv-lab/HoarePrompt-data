Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `n - 2` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n - 2`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Therefore, `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states:**
   - We need to ensure that `n - 2 >= -1`, which simplifies to `n >= 1`.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to `n - 2`.

5. **List all relevant variables and their adjusted states:**
   - `i` should be `n - 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given the initial states:
- `k` is an integer.
- `ii` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `l` is the count of 'L' in string `t`.
- `q1` is either `l - 2` or `l - 1`.
- `q2` is either `l` or `l + 1`.
- `y` is a string representation of `k`.
- `t` is the input string.

The relevant variables for the loop are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
