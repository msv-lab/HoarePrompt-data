Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `n` must be at least 2, and `t[i]` is not 'R'**

Explanation: The value of `q1` is decremented by 1. Initially, `i` was `n - 2`. After decrementing `q1` by 1, `i` becomes `n - 3`. The other variables (`k`, `n`, and `t[i]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
