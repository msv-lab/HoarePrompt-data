Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 2, -1, -1)`. This means `i` will take values from `n - 2` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts when `i` is set to `n - 2`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `n - 2` for the loop to start.

3. **Determine the Range Conditions**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`. So, `n - 2` should be greater than or equal to `-1` for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`k`, `ii`, `m`, `a`, `l`, `q1`, `q2`, `y`, and `t`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on these observations, the necessary adjustments are:

- `i` should be `n - 2`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `1` (since `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to `-1`).

Therefore, the state after adjustment is:

**State: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
