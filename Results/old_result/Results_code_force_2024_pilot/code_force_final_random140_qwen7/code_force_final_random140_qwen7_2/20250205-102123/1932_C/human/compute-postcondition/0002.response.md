Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
