Postcondition: `i` is either 5 or 6, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is updated as follows: if `i + 1` equals the length of `a` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `ans` is updated by adding `b[i]` to its current value; otherwise, `ans` is the string `a[0] + b[i-1]` if `i` equals the length of `a` and `b[i-1] < a[i]`, or `a[0]` if `i < len(a)` and `b[i-1] >= a[i]`, or `b[0]` if `i` is 1, `work` is False if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i+1]` or if `i` is 1, otherwise `work` is True.
