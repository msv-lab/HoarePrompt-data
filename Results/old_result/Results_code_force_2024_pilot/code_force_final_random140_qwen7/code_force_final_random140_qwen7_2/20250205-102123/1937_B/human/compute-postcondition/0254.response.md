Postcondition: **`counter` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is constructed based on the comparison between characters in `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`, `j` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is true or false, the values of `counter`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, and `j` remain as specified in the if part, since there is no else part provided.
