Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1, `a` must have more than 1 element, and if `a[2]` is '0' and `b[1]` is '1', then `counter` is 2; otherwise, `counter` remains 1, and `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`.

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, `counter` will be either 1 or 2 based on the specified conditions, `j` will remain 1, `a` will still have more than 1 element, and if `a[2]` is '0' and `b[1]` is '1', `counter` will be set to 2; otherwise, `counter` will remain 1 and `a[j + 1]` (which is `a[2]`) will equal `b[j]` (which is `b[1]`).
