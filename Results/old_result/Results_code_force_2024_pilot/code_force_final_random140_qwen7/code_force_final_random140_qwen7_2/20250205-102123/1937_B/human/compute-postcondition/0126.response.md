Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is `ans` + `b[2]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `b[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 2, it is now incremented by 1 to become 3. The value of `ans` is updated to be its original value plus `b[2]`. The precondition that `len(a)` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
