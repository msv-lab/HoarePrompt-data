Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is the string `a[0]`, `work` is True, the current value of `b[i-1]` is less than the current value of `a[i]` where `i` is now 1.**
