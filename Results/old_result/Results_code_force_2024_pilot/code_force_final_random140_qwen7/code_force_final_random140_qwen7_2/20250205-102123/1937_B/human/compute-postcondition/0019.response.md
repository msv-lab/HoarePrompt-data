Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is the string `a[0]`, `work` is True**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work`) remain unchanged.
