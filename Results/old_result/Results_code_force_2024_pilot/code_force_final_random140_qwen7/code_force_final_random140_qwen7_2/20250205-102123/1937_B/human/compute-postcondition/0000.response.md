Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1; the variable `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readline`**.

This output state indicates that the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the assignment of the `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`.
