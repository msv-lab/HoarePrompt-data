Output State: **`counter` is 2, `ans` is constructed based on the comparison between characters in `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Initially, `counter` was 1, so after executing this line, `counter` becomes 2. The values of `ans`, `i`, `work`, and `j` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
