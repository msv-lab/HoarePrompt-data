Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is equal to `a[2] + a[i]` if `i` is 3, otherwise `ans` is equal to `a[2] + a[2]`; `work` is `False`.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i` or `ans`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `i` and `ans` while updating `work` to `False`.
