Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is `True`
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + b[i]` where `i` is 2, `i` is either `len(a)` or `2`, `work` is `True`, and if `i` is `len(a)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `ans` is the string `b[0]`, `i` is 2, `work` is `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0] + a[2]` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is `a[0] + a[2] + b[3]` if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, and `i` is either 4 or the loop/break condition is met, or `ans` is `a[0] + b[2]` and `i` is 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `ans` is updated to its current value plus either `a[i]` (if `i + 1` does not equal the length of `a` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`) or `b[i]` (if `i + 1` equals the length of `a` or `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`), or `b[i]` (if `i + 1` equals the length of `a` or `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`), and `i` remains unchanged in the first case or is increased by 1 in the second case or the third case.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
