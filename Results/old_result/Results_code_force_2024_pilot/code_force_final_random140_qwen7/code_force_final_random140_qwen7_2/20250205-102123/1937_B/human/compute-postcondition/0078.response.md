Output State: **`counter` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets `counter` to 1. Since no other operations are performed on `counter`, `j`, `a`, or `b`, their previous states remain unchanged. The condition mentioned in the postcondition is not directly applied because the code does not include any comparison or increment based on that condition.
