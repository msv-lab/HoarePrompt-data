Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus `a[i]`, and `i` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `ans += a[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `a[i]`. The variable `i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `ans` is updated to its current value plus `a[i]`, while `i` remains unchanged.
