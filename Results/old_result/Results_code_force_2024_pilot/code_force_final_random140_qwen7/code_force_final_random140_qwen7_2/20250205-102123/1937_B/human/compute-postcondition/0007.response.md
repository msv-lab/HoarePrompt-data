Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
