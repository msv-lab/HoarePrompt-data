Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `counter` is either 1 or 2.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `a` must have more than 1 element.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 2; otherwise, `counter` remains 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0, the loop will continue as long as `j < len(a) - 1`.
   - After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.

5. **Update the conditions based on the new value of `j`**:
   - `j` will be 1, so we need to check the condition `a[j + 1]` (which is `a[2]`) and `b[j]` (which is `b[1]`).
   - The postcondition for `counter` will depend on whether `a[2]` is '0' and `b[1]` is '1'.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `counter` remains either 1 or 2.
- `j` becomes 1.
- `a` must still have more than 1 element.
- The condition for `counter` will now depend on `a[2]` and `b[1]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1, `a` must have more than 1 element, and if `a[2]` is '0' and `b[1]` is '1', then `counter` is 2; otherwise, `counter` remains 1**.
