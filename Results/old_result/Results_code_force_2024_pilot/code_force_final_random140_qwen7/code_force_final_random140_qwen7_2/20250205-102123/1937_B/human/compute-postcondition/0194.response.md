Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `work` is `True`, and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 1. After executing the code, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
