Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[4]` if `i` is 3, otherwise `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[3]`; `ans` is increased by `b[i]`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is either 3 or 4.
- `ans` is calculated based on the value of `i`: if `i` is 3, then `ans = a[2] + b[3]`; otherwise, `ans = a[2] + b[2]`.
- The code `ans += b[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `b[i]`.
- If `i` is 3, then `ans` becomes `a[2] + b[3] + b[3] = a[2] + 2 * b[3]`.
- If `i` is 4, then `ans` becomes `a[2] + b[2] + b[4] = a[2] + b[2] + b[4]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is increased by `b[i]` based on the initial value of `i`.
