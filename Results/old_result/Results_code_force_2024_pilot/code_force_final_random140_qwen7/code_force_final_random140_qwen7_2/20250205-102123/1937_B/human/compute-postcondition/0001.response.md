Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and the values of `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` remain unchanged; the variable `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readline`.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, the binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}`, and the variable `input` being assigned `sys.stdin.readline` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, along with the binary strings and the assignment to `input`, are still valid.
