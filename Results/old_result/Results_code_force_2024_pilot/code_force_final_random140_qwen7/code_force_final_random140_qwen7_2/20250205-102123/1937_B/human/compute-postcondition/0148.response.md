State: **`counter` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` must have more than 1 element** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `j` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(a)` must be greater than 1 (i.e., `a` must have more than 1 element).
4. The initial value of `counter` (which is 1) does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j`, `a`, and the condition that `a` must have more than 1 element.
