Output State: **`work` is True, `a` is updated to the stripped input string, counter is the total number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` was met throughout the entire string `a`, `i` is 0, `t` is still a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `b` remains unchanged, `ans` is an empty string, `j` is one less than the length of `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
