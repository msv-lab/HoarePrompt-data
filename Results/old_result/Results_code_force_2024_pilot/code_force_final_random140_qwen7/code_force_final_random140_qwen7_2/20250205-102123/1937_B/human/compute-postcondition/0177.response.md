Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `a` is the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variables `counter` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
