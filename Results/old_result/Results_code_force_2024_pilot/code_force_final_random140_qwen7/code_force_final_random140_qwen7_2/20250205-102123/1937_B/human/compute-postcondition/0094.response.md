Postcondition: `work` is True, `a` is updated to the stripped input string, `counter` is the total number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` was met throughout the entire string `a`, `i` is 2, `t` is still a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `b` remains unchanged, `ans` is equal to `a[0]`, `j` is one less than the length of `a`, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`.
