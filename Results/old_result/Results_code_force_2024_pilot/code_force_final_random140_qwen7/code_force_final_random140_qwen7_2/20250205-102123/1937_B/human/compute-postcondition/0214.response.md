Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0] + b[2]`, `i` is `2`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` adds the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the current value of `ans`. Given that `i` is `2`, `ans` is updated to `a[0] + b[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
