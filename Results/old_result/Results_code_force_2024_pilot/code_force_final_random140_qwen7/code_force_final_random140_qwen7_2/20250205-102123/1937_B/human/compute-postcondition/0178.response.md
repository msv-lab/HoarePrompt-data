Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `b`. The values of `counter` and `j` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The initial value of `a` (which is the stripped input string) is now stored in `b`.
