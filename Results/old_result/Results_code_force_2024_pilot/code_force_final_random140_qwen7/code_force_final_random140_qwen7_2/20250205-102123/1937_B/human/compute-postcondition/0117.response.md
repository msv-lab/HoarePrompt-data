Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is equal to `a[2]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[3]` but since `len(a)` must be greater than 2, it's `a[2]`) to its current value. The precondition that `len(a)` must be greater than 2 remains valid.
