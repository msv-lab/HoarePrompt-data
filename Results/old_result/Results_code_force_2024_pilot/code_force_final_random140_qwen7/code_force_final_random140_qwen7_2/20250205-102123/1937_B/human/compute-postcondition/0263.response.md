Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of binary strings), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \). It then constructs a new string \( ans \) by comparing corresponding characters of \( a \) and \( b \) according to specific rules. After constructing \( ans \), it prints the string. Additionally, it counts the maximum number of consecutive times a specific condition (\( a[j + 1] == '0' \) and \( b[j] == '1' \)) is met in the string \( a \) and prints this count. Finally, it ensures all test cases are processed and outputs the results accordingly.**
