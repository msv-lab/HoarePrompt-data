Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user, `b` is the stripped input from the user, `ans` is `b[0]`, `work` is False, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` is updated to include the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
