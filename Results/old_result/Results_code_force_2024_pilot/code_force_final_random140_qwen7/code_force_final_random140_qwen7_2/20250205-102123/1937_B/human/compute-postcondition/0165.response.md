Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `counter` is either 1 or 2.
- `j` is 1.
- `a` must have more than 1 element.
- If `a[2]` is '0' and `b[1]` is '1', then `counter` is 2; otherwise, `counter` remains 1.
- `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = len(a) - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` would be 2 (since `j` increments by 1 in each iteration).

2. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `j < len(a) - 1`.
   - For `j` to be 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 3 (because `2 < len(a) - 1` implies `len(a) > 3`).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `counter` remains unchanged unless the condition `a[2] == '0' and b[1] == '1'` is met.
   - `a[j + 1]` (which is `a[3]`) should equal `b[j]` (which is `b[2]`).

### Final State
Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are:

- `j` becomes 2.
- `a` must still have more than 3 elements.
- `counter` remains either 1 or 2 based on the condition `a[2] == '0' and b[1] == '1'`.
- `a[3]` must equal `b[2]`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, `a` must have more than 3 elements, and if `a[2]` is '0' and `b[1]` is '1', then `counter` is 2; otherwise, `counter` remains 1, and `a[3]` equals `b[2]`.**
