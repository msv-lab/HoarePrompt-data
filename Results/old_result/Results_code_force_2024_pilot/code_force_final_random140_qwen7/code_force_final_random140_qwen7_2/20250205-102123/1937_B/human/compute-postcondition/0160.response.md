Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1, `a` must have more than 1 element, and if `a[2]` is '0' and `b[1]` is '1', then `counter` is 2; otherwise, `counter` remains 1. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `counter` becomes either 2 or 3 depending on its original value. If `a[j + 1]` does not equal `b[j]`, `counter` remains unchanged.
