Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans` is equal to `a[2] + b[3]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it simply exits the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged.
