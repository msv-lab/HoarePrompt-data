Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial states of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
