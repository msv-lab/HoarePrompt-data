Output State: **`counter` is `new_counter`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is `a[0] + a[2] + b[3]`, `i` is `3`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += b[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the character at index `i` of the string `b`. Given that `i` is `3`, `ans` is updated to include the character at index `3` of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
