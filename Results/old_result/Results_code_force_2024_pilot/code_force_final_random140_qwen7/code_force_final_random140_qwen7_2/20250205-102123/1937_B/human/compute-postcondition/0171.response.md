Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, `a` must have more than 3 elements, and if `a[2]` is '0' and `b[1]` is '1', then `counter` is 2; otherwise, `counter` is 3 and `a[3]` equals `b[2]`.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts. If the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is true, then `counter` becomes 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains as per the original condition where it is 3 if `a[2]` is not '0' or `b[1]` is not '1', or it is 2 if `a[2]` is '0' and `b[1]` is '1'.
