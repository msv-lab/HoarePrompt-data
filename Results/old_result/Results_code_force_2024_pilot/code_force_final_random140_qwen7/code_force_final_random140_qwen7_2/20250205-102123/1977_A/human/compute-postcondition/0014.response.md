Output: **YES**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). The variables `n` and `m` are defined as the first and second integer inputs by the user, respectively. However, these variables (`n` and `m`) are not used in the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES'. Therefore, regardless of the values of `n` and `m`, the output will always be 'YES'.
