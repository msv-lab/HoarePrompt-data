Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly determine whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the current implementation is flawed:

1. **Condition `if n < m:`**: This condition checks if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`. If this condition is true, it prints 'NO', which is incorrect because it's possible to have more moves than cubes (e.g., you can remove cubes).

2. **Conditions involving parity (`n & 1` and `m & 1`):** These conditions check if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even. While these conditions are necessary, they are not sufficient to determine the possibility of achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each pair of moves (one put and one remove) results in no net change in the number of cubes. Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
- If `(n - m)` is even, then it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Otherwise, it is not possible.
