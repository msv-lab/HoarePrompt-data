Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even after taking input from the user. If the condition `n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0)` is true, no changes are made to `n` and `m`. If the condition is false, no changes are made to `n` and `m` as well.**
