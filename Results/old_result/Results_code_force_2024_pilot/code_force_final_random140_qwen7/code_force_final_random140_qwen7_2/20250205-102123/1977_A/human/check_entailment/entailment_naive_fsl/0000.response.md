Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is less than `m`, which is not a valid condition according to the problem description. Instead, the program should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing), and thus the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes will alternate with each move.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 4` and `m = 2`. According to the problem, it should be possible to achieve this by putting 2 cubes and then removing 2 cubes, which would result in a difference of 2 (an even number). However, the current implementation would incorrectly print "NO" because `n` is not less than `m`.

To fix this, the program should check if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` instead of comparing `n` and `m` directly.
