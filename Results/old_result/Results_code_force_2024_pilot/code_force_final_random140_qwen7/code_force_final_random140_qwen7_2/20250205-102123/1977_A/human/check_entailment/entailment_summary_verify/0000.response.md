### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move either adds or removes exactly one cube.
   - Therefore, the difference between the initial number of cubes (which is 0) and the final number of cubes (`m`) must be equal to the number of moves that add cubes minus the number of moves that remove cubes.
   - This means the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move changes the count by 1.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes pairs of integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is less than `m`. If true, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it checks if both `n` and `m` are either odd or even. If true, it prints "YES".

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
   - The condition `n < m` is incorrect and should be replaced with checking if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct condition to check is if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
   - If this condition holds, it means it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - If this condition does not hold, it means it is not possible.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment was accurate in pointing out the mistake, but the solution to fix it is straightforward. The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
