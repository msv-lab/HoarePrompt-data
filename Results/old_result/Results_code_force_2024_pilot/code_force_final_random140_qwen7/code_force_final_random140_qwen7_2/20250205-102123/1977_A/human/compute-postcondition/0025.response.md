Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each iteration, `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. The values of `n` and `m` do not change regardless of the condition `n < m`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 100. For each pair of inputs `(n, m)` provided during the iterations, the values of `n` and `m` will remain unchanged as long as they are either both odd or both even. If the condition `n < m` is met, the program prints 'NO' and moves on to the next iteration without changing the values of `n` and `m`. If the condition `n & 1 and m & 1` (both `n` and `m` are odd) or `n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0` (both `n` and `m` are even) is satisfied, the program prints 'YES' and also does not change the values of `n` and `m`.
