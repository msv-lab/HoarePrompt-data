Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user. If both `n` and `m` are odd, or both are even, then the program continues with these values of `n` and `m`. Otherwise, the program does not change the values of `n` and `m`.
