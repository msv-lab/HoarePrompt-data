Output State: **`balance` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `char` is the second character of the string `s`, and the list `positions` now contains two tuples `(2, 2, char)`**.

Explanation: The value of `balance` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 1 or -1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `positions` is updated to contain the new tuple `(2, 2, char)`.
