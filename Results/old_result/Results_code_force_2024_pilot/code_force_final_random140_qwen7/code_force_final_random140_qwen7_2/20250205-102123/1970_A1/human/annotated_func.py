#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will have the following characteristics:
    #
    #- `balance` will be either the maximum value it reached during the loop (if the string `s` has more `(` than `)` characters) or 0 (if the string `s` has an equal number of `(` and `)` characters), or the minimum value it reached during the loop (if the string `s` has more `)` than `(` characters).
    #- `n` will be the length of the string `s`.
    #- `i` will be `n` (since the loop iterates over each character in the string, the last index will be `n-1`).
    #- `char` will be the last character of the string `s`.
    #- The list `positions` will contain a total of `n` tuples. Each tuple will have the form `(balance, i, char)`, where `balance` represents the balance of parentheses up to that point in the string, `i` is the index of the current character, and `char` is the character at that index.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` composed of the last character (`char`) from each tuple in the list `positions`, sorted by the `balance` in ascending order and by `-i` in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses. It processes this string to create a list of tuples containing the balance of parentheses up to each point, the index of the character, and the character itself. After sorting this list by the balance in ascending order and by the negative index in descending order, it constructs and returns a new string from the last character of each tuple in the sorted list.
