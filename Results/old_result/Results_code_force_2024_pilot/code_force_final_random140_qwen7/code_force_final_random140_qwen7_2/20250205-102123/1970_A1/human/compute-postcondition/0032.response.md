Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses. It processes this string to create a list of tuples containing the balance of parentheses up to each point, the index of the character, and the character itself. After sorting this list by the balance in ascending order and by the negative index in descending order, it constructs and returns a new string from the last character of each tuple in the sorted list.**
