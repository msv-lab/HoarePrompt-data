Output State: **`balance` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of the string `s`, and `char` is not '('**

The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Given that the initial value of `balance` is 0, after executing this line, `balance` becomes -1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
