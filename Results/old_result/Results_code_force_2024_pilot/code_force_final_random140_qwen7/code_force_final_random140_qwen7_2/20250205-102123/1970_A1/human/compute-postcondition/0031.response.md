The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and forms a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `result` composed of the last character from each tuple in the list `positions`, sorted by the `balance` in ascending order and by `-i` in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence. It returns a string `result` made up of the last character from each tuple in the list `positions`, sorted first by `balance` in ascending order and then by `-i` in descending order.**
