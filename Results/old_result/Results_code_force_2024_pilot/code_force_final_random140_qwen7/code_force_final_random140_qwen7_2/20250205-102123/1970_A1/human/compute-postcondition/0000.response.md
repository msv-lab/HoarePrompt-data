Output State: **s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; n is the length of the string s.**

The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The string `s` remains unchanged, and its properties (being a balanced parentheses sequence and having a length not exceeding 500,000) are still valid.
