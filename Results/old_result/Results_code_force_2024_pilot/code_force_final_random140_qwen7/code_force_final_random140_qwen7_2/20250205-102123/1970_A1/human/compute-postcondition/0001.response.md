Output State: **`balance` is 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The variable `balance` is initialized to 0. The length of the string `s`, denoted by `n`, remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it within the given code snippet. The initial state of `s` being a balanced parentheses sequence and `n` being its length is preserved.
