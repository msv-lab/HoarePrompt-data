Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is simply `_` (a dummy variable) and does not involve any specific variables. However, the loop condition is determined by the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1. Since it is given that `t` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it remains greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
