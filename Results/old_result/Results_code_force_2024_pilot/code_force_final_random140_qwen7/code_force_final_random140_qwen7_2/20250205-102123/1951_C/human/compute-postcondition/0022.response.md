Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, it will increment to 2 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` will be 2).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2.

5. **Postconditions from the Loop Body**:
   - The postconditions given are related to the loop body, but they do not affect the loop itself. They are conditions that hold true after the loop body executes, but they do not change the loop's control variables directly.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
