Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices), prices` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` and assigns its return value to the variable `result`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` are updated according to the initial state and the operations performed within the function call. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned to new input integers, and `prices` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from user input.
