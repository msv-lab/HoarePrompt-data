Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**.

The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, the value of `result` is the return value of this function call. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
