You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, m is a positive integer representing the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, k is a positive integer representing the total number of tickets to buy, and prices is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    """Calculates the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

    Args:
        n: The number of sale days.
        m: The maximum number of tickets purchasable each day.
        k: The total number of tickets to buy.
        prices: A list of prices per ticket for each day.

    Returns:
        The minimum amount of money needed to purchase k tickets.
    """
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    prices.sort()
    for i in range(n):
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        cost = tickets_to_buy * prices[i]
        
        total_cost += cost
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        if tickets_bought == k:
            break
        
    #State: All tickets have been bought, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs calculated over all iterations, and `i` equals `n-1`.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, which is the sum of the costs calculated over all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of sale days), `m` (a positive integer representing the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (a positive integer representing the total number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of `n` positive integers where each element represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days). It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, which is the sum of the costs calculated over all iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, which is the sum of the costs calculated over all iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
