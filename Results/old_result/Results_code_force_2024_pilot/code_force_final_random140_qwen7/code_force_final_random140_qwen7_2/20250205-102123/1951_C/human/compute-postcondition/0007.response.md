Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is simply `_` (which is a placeholder indicating that the loop variable is not used), and there are no other variables directly involved in the loop condition.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of each iteration.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input()`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is a placeholder and not used, it does not affect the loop condition.
   - The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `t`).

5. **Calculate the new state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 (since `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input()`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
