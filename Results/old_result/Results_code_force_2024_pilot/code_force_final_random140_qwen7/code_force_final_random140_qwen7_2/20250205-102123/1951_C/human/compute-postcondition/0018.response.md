Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of test cases submitted, `n` is an input integer for each test case, `m` is an input integer for each test case, `k` is an input integer for each test case, `prices` is a list of integers for each test case obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for each test case.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will hold the final number of test cases submitted, and for each test case, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` will contain the respective inputs for that test case. The variable `result` will contain the output of the function `func_1` for each test case.
