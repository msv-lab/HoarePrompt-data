You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). prices is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
def func_2():
    """Handles input and output for multiple test cases."""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of test cases submitted, `n` is an input integer for each test case, `m` is an input integer for each test case, `k` is an input integer for each test case, `prices` is a list of integers for each test case obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for each test case.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will hold the final number of test cases submitted, and for each test case, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` will contain the respective inputs for that test case. The variable `result` will contain the output of the function `func_1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9), and a list `prices` of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days. The function does not return anything explicitly based on the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
