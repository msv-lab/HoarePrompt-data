Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9), and a list `prices` of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days. The function does not return anything explicitly based on the given information.**
