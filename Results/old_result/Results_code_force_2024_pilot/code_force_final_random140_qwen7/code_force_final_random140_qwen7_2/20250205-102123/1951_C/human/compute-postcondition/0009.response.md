Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `prices = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `prices`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
