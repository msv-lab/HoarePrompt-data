### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the sorting step in `func_1` is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to confirm this:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to minimize the cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days, with a maximum of `m` tickets per day.
   - The logic iterates through each day, deciding how many tickets to buy based on the remaining tickets needed (`tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`).
   - It calculates the cost for those tickets and updates the total cost and the count of tickets bought.
   - The loop breaks once the required `k` tickets are bought.

2. **Sorting the Prices List**:
   - Sorting the `prices` list is unnecessary because the logic works correctly without it. The algorithm still ensures that tickets are bought in a way that minimizes the total cost, regardless of the order of prices.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

Given the above analysis, the program is indeed correct. The sorting step is unnecessary but does not impact the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct in terms of functionality, even though it includes an unnecessary sorting step.
