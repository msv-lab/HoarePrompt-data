Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `tickets_to_buy` multiplied by `prices[i]` to the variable `cost`. Given that `i` is 2, `cost` is calculated as `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `tickets_to_buy` remain unchanged from their initial states.
