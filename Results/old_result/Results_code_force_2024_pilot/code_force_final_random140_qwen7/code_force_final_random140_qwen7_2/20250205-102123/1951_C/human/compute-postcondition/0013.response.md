Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned to new input integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation: The code reassigns the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` to new input integers obtained from user input using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial values of `t`, `prices`, and `result` remain unchanged. The `result` remains the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`, which was calculated before the reassignment of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
