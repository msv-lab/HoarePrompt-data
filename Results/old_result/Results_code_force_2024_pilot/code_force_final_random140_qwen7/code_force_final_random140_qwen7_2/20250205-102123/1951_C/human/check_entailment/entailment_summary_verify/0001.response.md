### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the sorting step in `func_1` is unnecessary but still concludes that the core logic of the program is correct. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure the logic is sound and the program meets the requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Objective**: Calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.
   - **Logic**:
     - Iterate through each day.
     - Determine the number of tickets that can be bought on the current day (`tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`).
     - Calculate the cost for those tickets and add it to the total cost.
     - Update the count of tickets bought.
     - Break out of the loop once `k` tickets are bought.
   - **Unnecessary Sorting**: The sorting step is indeed unnecessary because the algorithm works based on the current day's price and the remaining tickets to be bought. Sorting the prices list does not change the outcome of the algorithm.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Objective**: Handle input and output for multiple test cases.
   - **Logic**:
     - Read the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, read `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of prices.
     - Call `func_1` with these parameters.
     - Print the result for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation

- **Sorting the Prices List**: While sorting the prices list is unnecessary, it does not affect the correctness of the program. The algorithm still works correctly without sorting.
- **Buying Tickets**: The logic for buying tickets is correct. It ensures that tickets are bought in such a way that the total cost is minimized, considering the constraints.
- **Handling Test Cases**: The handling of test cases in `func_2` is correct. It processes each test case independently and prints the result for each.

### Conclusion

The program is correct in terms of functionality, even though it includes an unnecessary sorting step. The sorting step does not impact the final result and can be removed for efficiency.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
