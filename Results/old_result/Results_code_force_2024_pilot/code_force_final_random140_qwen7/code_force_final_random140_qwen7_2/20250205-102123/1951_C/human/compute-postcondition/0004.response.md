Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers obtained from input().**

Explanation: The code `prices = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new variable `prices` is created and assigned a list of integers based on the input.
