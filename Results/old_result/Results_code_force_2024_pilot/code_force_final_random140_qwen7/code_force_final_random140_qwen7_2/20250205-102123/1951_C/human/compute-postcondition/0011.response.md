Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` itself is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `prices` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of `func_1` with the given parameters.

Output: **result (the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
