Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned a list containing the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`. Therefore, the output state includes these conditions along with the new list `l` containing `ans`.
