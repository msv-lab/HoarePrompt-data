Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. This is because the range function in Python generates values from the start (inclusive) to the stop (exclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `x` and `n` remain as input integers.
   - `k` is still `x // n`.
   - `ans` is the maximum value among 1, `i`, and `x // i`.
   - `x % i` equals 0.
   - The list `l` is `[1, i, x // i]`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

5. **Check if the next value of `i` satisfies the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to continue, the next value of `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - We need to check if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - If `i + 1` is within the range, then the loop can continue.

Given the current state:
- `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `k` is `x // n`.

Since `k` is `x // n`, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. We need to ensure that `i + 1` is still within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

If `i + 1` is still within this range, the loop can continue. Otherwise, the loop will terminate.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- Check if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

If `i + 1` is within the range, the loop can continue. If not, the loop terminates.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among 1, `i`, and `x // i`, `x % (i + 1)` equals 0, and the list `l` is `[1, i + 1, x // (i + 1)]` if `i + 1` is within the range; otherwise, the loop terminates.**
