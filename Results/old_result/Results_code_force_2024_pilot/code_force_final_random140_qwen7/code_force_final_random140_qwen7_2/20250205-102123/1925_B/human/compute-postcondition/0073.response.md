Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`, `x % (i + 3)` equals `0`, and the list `l` is `[ans, i]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `l` was initially `[ans]`, after appending `i`, `l` becomes `[ans, i]`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and the condition `x % (i + 3) == 0`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
