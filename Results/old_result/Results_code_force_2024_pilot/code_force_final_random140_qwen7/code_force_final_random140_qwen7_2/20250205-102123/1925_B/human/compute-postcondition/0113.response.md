Postcondition: `i` is 6, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `l` is a list containing at least one element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value among [6, 6, x // 6]. If `x % 6 == 0`, then `x` is divided by 6 and added to the list `l` as the new maximum value. Otherwise, the list `l` remains unchanged with `ans` being the maximum value among [6, 6, x // 6].
