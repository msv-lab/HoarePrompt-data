Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer from the input, `n` is an integer from the input, and `k` is the integer result of `x // n`.**

This means that `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, while the values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
