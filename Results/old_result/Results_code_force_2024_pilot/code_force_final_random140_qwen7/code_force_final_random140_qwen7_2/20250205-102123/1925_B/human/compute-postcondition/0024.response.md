Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains an integer and is still divisible by `i + 1`, and `i + 1` is still less than or equal to `int(x)`. The list `l` now contains the original value of `ans` and the new value of `x // i`.
