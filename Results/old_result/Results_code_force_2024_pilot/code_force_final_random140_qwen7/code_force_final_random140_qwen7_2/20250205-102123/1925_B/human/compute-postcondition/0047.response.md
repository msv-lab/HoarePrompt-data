Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the expressions used to determine the range of the loop, which are `1` and `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2)`. This means `i` will take values from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is `1` and that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is a valid upper limit for the loop.

4. **Consider the Initial Values of Other Variables**: The other variables (`x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `1`.
- The upper limit of the loop, which is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, must be a valid number.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1, and `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is a valid number**.
