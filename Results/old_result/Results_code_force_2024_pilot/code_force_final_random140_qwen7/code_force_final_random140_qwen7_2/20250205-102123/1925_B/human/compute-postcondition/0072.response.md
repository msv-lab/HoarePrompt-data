Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`, `x % (i + 3)` equals `0`, and the list `l` is `[ans]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = [ans]` simply assigns the value of `ans` to the first element of the list `l`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and the condition `x % (i + 3)` remain unchanged. The list `l` is updated to contain only the value of `ans`.
