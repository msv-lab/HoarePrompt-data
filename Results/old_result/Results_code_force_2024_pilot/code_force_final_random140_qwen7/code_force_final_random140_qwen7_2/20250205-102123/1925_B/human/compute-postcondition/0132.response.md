Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum value among the following: 1, any divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{n} \), and any quotient when \( x \) is divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to \( \sqrt{x} \).**
