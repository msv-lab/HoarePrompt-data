Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer (though `n` is not used in the loop).
   - `l` is a list containing at least one element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given the above points, let's determine the new state:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged.

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is k + 1, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `l` is a list containing at least one element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 6.

State: **`i` is 6, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `l` is a list containing at least one element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**
