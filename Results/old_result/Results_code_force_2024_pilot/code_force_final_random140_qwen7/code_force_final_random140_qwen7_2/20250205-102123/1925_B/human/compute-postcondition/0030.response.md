Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` (since the range is inclusive of the upper bound).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`.

3. **Update the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
   - We need to check if `i + 2` is still within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Check the Range Condition:**
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i + 2 <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - If this condition holds, the loop can continue.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `x` must still be divisible by `i + 2`.
   - `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`**
