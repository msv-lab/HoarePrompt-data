Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The initial state's condition about the final value of `ans` being determined as the maximum value among all possible values of `i` and `x // i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `int(x)` is still valid but the actual value of `ans` is not yet determined as the input values for `x` and `n` are not specified. Therefore, the only updated information is that `x` and `n` are now input integers.
