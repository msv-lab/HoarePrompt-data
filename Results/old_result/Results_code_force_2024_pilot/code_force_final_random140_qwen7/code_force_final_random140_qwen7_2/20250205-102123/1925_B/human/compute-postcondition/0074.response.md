Postcondition: `i` is `i + 2`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`, `x % (i + 3)` equals `0`, and the list `l` is `[ans, i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is greater than `k`, the list `l` remains as `[ans]`.
