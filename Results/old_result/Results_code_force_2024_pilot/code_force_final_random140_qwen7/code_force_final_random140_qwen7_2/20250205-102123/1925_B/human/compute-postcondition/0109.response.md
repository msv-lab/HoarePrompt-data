Output State: **`i` is 6, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list containing the elements `[6, 6, x // 6]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `x // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 6, `x // i` is equivalent to `x // 6`. Since `i` is 6, the if condition `i <= k` is not relevant here because `k` is not defined. Thus, the list `l` is updated to include `x // 6` along with the existing elements `[6, 6]`.
