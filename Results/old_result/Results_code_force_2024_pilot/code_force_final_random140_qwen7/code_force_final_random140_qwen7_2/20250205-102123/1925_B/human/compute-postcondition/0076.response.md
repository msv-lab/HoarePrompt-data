Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`, `x % (i + 3)` equals `0`, and the list `l` is `[ans, i + 2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`, and `x % (i + 3)` equals `0`. After appending `x // i` to `l`, the list `l` becomes `[ans, i + 2]` because `ans` was already calculated as the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`.
