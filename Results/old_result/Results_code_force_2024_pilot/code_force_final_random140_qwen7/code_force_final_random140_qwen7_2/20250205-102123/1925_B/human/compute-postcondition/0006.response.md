Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`; `l` is a list containing one element which is 'ans'.**

The code initializes a list `l` with a single element `'ans'`. No other changes are made to the variables `i`, `x`, or `n`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
