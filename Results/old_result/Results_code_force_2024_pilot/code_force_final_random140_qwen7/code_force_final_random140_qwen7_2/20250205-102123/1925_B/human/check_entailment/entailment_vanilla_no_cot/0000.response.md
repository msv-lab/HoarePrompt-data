Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `n`.

2. **Finding the Base Difficulty**: It calculates the base difficulty `k` which is `x // n`. This gives an initial idea of how the total difficulty `x` can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems.

3. **Finding Possible Divisors**: For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if splitting the problem into sub-problems of size `i` or `x // i` (whichever is smaller than or equal to `k`) could yield a higher balance.

4. **Max Balance Calculation**: It keeps track of the maximum balance found during these checks.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum balance for each test case.

The logic is sound and correctly follows the problem statement. It efficiently finds the maximum balance by considering all possible ways to split the total difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems and choosing the one with the highest GCD.
