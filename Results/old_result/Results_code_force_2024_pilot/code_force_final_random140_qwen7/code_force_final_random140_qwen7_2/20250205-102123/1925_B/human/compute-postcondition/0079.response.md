Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`, `x % (i + 3)` equals `0`, and the list `l` is `[ans, i + 2]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(l)` calculates the maximum value among the elements in the list `l` which is `[ans, i + 2]`. Since `ans` is already defined as the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`, and the list `l` contains `ans` and `i + 2`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `x % (i + 3)`) remain as they were in the initial state, and the list `l` still contains the values `[ans, i + 2]`.
