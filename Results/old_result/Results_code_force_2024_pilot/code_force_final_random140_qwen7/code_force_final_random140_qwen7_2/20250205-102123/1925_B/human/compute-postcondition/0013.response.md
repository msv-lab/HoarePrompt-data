Output State: **`i` is an integer, `x` is an integer and divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing 'ans', `i`, and `x // i`, `n` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `x` is divisible by `i`, `x // i` will be an integer. The list `l` initially contains 'ans', `i`, and an additional element `i` because `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. After appending `x // i` to `l`, the updated list `l` now contains 'ans', `i`, `i`, and `x // i`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
