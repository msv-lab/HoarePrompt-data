Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop continues until `i` exceeds `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- During each iteration, `ans` is updated to be the maximum value among 1, the current value of `i`, and `x // i`.
- After the loop completes, `ans` holds the largest factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` (where `k` is `x // n`), unless no such factor exists, in which case `ans` remains 1.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the largest factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (the largest factor of x that is less than or equal to k, where k is x // n)**
