Postcondition: `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing either two elements where the first element is the original value of `i` and the second element is `i`, or `l` remains unchanged as it is a list with one element which is `ans`.
