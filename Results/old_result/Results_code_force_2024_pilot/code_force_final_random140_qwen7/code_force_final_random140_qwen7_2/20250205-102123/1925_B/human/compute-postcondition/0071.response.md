Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `x` and `n` remain as input integers
   - `k` is still `x // n`
   - `ans` is the maximum value among `1`, `i + 1`, and `x // (i + 1)`
   - `x % (i + 2)` equals `0`
   - The list `l` is `[ans]` if `i + 2` is within the range; otherwise, the loop terminates.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` in the next iteration, so `i` will become `i + 2`.
   - `x` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i + 2`.
   - `x % (i + 3)` must equal `0` for the loop to continue.
   - The list `l` will be updated to include the new `ans` if `i + 3` is within the range.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `i` will be `i + 2`.
- `x` and `n` remain as input integers.
- `k` remains as `x // n`.
- `ans` will be the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`.
- `x % (i + 3)` must equal `0`.
- The list `l` will be `[ans]` if `i + 3` is within the range; otherwise, the loop terminates.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value among `1`, `i + 2`, and `x // (i + 2)`, `x % (i + 3)` equals `0`, and the list `l` is `[ans]` if `i + 3` is within the range; otherwise, the loop terminates.**
