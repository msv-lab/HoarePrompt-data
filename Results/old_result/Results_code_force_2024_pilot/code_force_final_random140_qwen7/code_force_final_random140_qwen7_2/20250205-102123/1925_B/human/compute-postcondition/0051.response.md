Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1, `x % i` equals 0, `l` is `[1, i]`**.

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` was previously less than or equal to `k`, and now it has been added to the list, the updated state includes `l` with `i` appended to it, making `l` equal to `[1, i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
