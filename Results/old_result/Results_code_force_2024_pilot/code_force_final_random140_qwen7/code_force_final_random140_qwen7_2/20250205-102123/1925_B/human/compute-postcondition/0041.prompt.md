Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer from the input, `n` is an integer from the input, and `k` is the integer result of `x // n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing 'ans', `i`, and `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum value in list `l`. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, then `l` is a list containing 'ans' and `i`, and `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` and either `x // i` or `ans` (depending on whether the condition `x // i <= k` is true or false), `ans` is the maximum value between the elements of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing either the original value of `i` followed by `x // i` if `x // i <= k`, otherwise `l` remains a list with one element which is `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value in list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
