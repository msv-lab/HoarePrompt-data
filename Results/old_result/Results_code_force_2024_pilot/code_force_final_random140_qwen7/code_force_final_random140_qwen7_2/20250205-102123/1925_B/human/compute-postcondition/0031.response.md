Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is an integer, and `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`; `l` is a list containing one element which is `ans`.**

Explanation: The line `l = [ans]` creates a list `l` with one element, which is `ans`. However, since `ans` is not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot specify its exact value. The other variables (`i`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
