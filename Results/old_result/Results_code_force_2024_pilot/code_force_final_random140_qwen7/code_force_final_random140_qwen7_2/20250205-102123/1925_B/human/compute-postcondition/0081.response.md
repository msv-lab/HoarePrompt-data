Output State: The loop will continue to iterate until `i` exceeds `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `x` and `n` remain as input integers, `k` is still `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value found among 1, all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and their corresponding quotients, and the list `l` will not be relevant since the loop's final state focuses on the scalar value of `ans`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the largest possible value up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `x` and `n` will stay as they were initially, `k` remains unchanged as `x // n`, `ans` will hold the highest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` along with its corresponding quotient, and the list `l` will no longer be used as it was just a temporary storage during each iteration.
