Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1, `x % i` equals 0, and `l` is `[1, i, x // i]`**.

The code snippet appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `x // i` is already defined and its value is known to be less than or equal to `k`, the updated list `l` includes the new element. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
