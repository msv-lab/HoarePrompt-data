Output State: **`j` is 4; `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`; `res` now contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 4) * 3`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `j` is 4.
- `L1[i]` is a value such that `2 <= L1[i] + 1`, which simplifies to `1 <= L1[i]`.
- `res` contains a value equal to `(L1[i] // 2) * 1`. If `L1[i]` is divisible by 3, `res` also contains an additional value of `(L1[i] // 3) * 2`.
- The code `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))` appends the value of `(L1[i] // 4) * 3` to `res`.
- Since `j` is 4, `j - 1` is 3, and thus the appended value is `(L1[i] // 4) * 3`.

Therefore, the updated state is as described above.
