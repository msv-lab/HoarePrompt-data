Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads an input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` is still an integer between 2 and 1000. The variable `num` now holds the value entered by the user.
