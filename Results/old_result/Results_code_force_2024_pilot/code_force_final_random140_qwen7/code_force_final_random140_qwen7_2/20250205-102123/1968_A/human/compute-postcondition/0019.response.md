Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `num`.
   - `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.
   - `L1[num]` must be at least 1.
   - If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is a list with one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` ranges from 2 to `L1[i]`. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `L1[i] + 1` for the next iteration.

4. **Update the State:**
   - The variable `j` needs to be updated to `L1[i] + 1`.
   - All other variables (`num`, `i`, `L1`, and `res`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `j` is `L1[i] + 1`**.
