Output State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `res` is a list with one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block defined in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `num`, `i`, `L1`, and `res` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
