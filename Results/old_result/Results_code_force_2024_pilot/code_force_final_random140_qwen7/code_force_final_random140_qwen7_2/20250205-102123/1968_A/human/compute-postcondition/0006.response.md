Output State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `L1` is a list with two elements, the first element is the integer entered by the user and the second element is the integer entered by the user.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is that `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1 more than its previous value (which means `i` was 1 before the code), and `L1` is a list with one element which is an integer entered by the user.
- The code appends a new integer entered by the user to `L1`. The input prompt indicates that the entry number is `i + 1`, which is 2 (since `i` is now 2).
- After appending, `L1` will have two elements: the first element remains the integer entered by the user, and the second element is the new integer entered by the user.
- The value of `num` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
