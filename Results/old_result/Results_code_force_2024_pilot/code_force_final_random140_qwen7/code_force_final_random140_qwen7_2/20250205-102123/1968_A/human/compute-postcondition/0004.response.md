Output State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0; L1 is a list with one element which is an integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code appends an integer input by the user to the list `L1`. Since `num` is a positive integer greater than 0 in the initial state, it remains unchanged. The list `L1` is updated to include the newly appended integer.
