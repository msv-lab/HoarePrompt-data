Output State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `j` is `L1[i] + 1`, `res` is a list with one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement it is inside. Since there is no explicit loop or if statement mentioned in the code snippet, we assume it is inside the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `num`, `i`, `L1`, `j`, and `res` remain unchanged.
