You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    1000
    
    6

Output

    18
    98

- Program:
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers entered by the user. For each integer in the list, it calculates and prints the result of dividing the integer by its smallest divisor (other than 1) and then multiplying by one less than that divisor. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program attempts to find a divisor of `x` and then calculates a value `y` based on that divisor. However, this approach does not guarantee that the calculated `y` will maximize the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input `x = 10`. The program might calculate \(y\) as \(5\) (since \(10 / 2 = 5\) and \(2 - 1 = 1\), so \(5 \times 1 = 5\)), but the correct \(y\) should be \(5\) because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the maximum possible value. However, for other values of \(x\), the program might not find the optimal \(y\).

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible values of \(y\) from \(1\) to \(x-1\) and calculating \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) to find the maximum value. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    res = []
    for _ in range(num):
        x = int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(_ + 1) + '- '))
        max_value = 0
        best_y = 0
        for y in range(1, x):
            gcd_value = gcd(x, y)
            current_value = gcd_value + y
            if current_value > max_value:
                max_value = current_value
                best_y = y
        res.append(best_y)
    print(*res, sep='\n')

from math import gcd
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible values of \(y\) and finds the one that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
