Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`. The objects involved here are `j` and the expression `L1[i] + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: According to the loop, `j` starts from 2 and goes up to `L1[i] + 1`. Therefore, `j` should be set to 2 at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the value of `L1[i]`**: Since `j` is defined as `L1[i] + 3` outside the loop, we need to ensure that `L1[i]` is correctly set before the loop starts. Given that `L1[i]` is part of the condition for the loop, it must be set to a value such that `2 <= L1[i] + 1`.

4. **Ensure the condition `L1[num]` must be at least 1**: This condition is already given and doesn't need adjustment since it pertains to the list `L1` and its length, which is not directly used in the loop head.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `j` is set to 2 and `L1[i]` is correctly set such that the loop condition `2 <= L1[i] + 1` holds true.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be set to 2.
- `L1[i]` should be set to a value that satisfies the condition `2 <= L1[i] + 1`.

Since `L1[i]` is derived from the user input and must be an integer, we can assume it is correctly set based on the initial state provided.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `L1[i]` is a value that satisfies `2 <= L1[i] + 1`**
