Output State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1, `j` is `L1[i] + 2`, `res` is a list with two elements, the first is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and the second is the same as the first.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` contains one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. After appending, `res` now contains two elements, both of which are `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
