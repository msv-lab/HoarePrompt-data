Postcondition: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; if `L1[i] % j == 0`, then `res` is a list with one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the values of `num`, `i`, `L1`, and `res` remain unchanged.
