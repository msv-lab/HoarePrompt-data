Output State: **`num` is the final value it was set to during the last iteration, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `j` is `L1[num] + 2`. `res` is a list containing all the values calculated based on the divisors of each element in `L1` from 2 to the respective element + 1.**

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num` will be the final value it was set to during the last iteration. The variable `i` remains equal to `num` because it is decremented within the loop but never reaches a value less than 0. The list `L1` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the loop. The variable `j` starts from `L1[i] + 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration, so after all iterations, `j` will be `L1[num] + 2`. The list `res` accumulates results from the loop, with each element being calculated as `(L1[i] // j) * (j - 1)` for each divisor `j` of `L1[i]` from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`, for each `i` in the range of `num`.
