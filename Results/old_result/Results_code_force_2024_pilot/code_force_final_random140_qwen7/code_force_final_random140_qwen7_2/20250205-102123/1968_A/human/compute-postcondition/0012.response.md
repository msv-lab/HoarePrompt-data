Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is initially set to `num`.
   - `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < num`.
   - During each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `num` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `num-1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at `num` and the loop increments `i` from 0 to `num-1`, the loop will execute `num` times.
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `num`.
   - The list `L1` will contain exactly `num` elements, each being an integer input by the user.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `num` must be a positive integer greater than 0.
- `i` must be initialized to `num`.
- `L1` must be a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user**.
