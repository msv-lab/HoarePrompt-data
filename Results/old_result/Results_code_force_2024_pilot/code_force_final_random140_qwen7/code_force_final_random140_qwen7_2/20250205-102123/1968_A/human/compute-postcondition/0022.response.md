Postcondition: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `j` is `L1[i] + 1`. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, then `res` is a list with one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. If the condition `L1[i] % j == 0` is not met, the value of `res` remains unchanged.
