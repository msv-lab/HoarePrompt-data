Postcondition: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `j` is `L1[i] + 1`, `res` is a list with one element, which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
