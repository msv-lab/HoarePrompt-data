Output State: **`j` is 2, `res` is `L1[i] // 2 * 1`, `L1[i + 1]` satisfies \(2 \leq L1[i + 1] + 1\), `res` is appended with the value of `L1[i] // 2 * 1`**

Explanation: The value of `j` is updated to 2. The value of `res` remains as `L1[i] // 2 * 1`. The condition for `L1[i + 1]` remains unchanged. Additionally, the code appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Given that `j` is now 2, the value appended to `res` is `L1[i] // 2 * 1`.
