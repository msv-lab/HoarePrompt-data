Output State: **`j` is 2, `res` is `L1[i] // 2 * 1`, `L1[i + 1]` satisfies 2 <= `L1[i + 1]` + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned, the `break` statement implies that we are exiting the current context where `j`, `res`, and the conditions involving `L1` were being evaluated. The values of `j`, `res`, and the conditions on `L1` remain unchanged.
