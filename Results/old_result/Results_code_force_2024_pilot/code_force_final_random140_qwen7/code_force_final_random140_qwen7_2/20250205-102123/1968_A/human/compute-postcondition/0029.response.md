Output State: `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user, and `L1[num]` must be at least 1; `j` is `L1[i] + 3`, `res` is a list with three elements, each of which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will still be equal to `num`, and `L1` will remain as it was initially. The variable `j` will be set to `L1[i] + 3`, because the loop increments `j` starting from 2 up to `L1[i] + 1` and continues incrementing until the condition fails. The list `res` will contain three elements, each calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for `j = L1[i] + 1`, `L1[i] + 2`, and `L1[i] + 3`, respectively.
