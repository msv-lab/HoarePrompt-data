Based on the initial state provided:

- `num` is the final value it was set to during the last iteration.
- `i` is equal to `num`.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each of which is an integer entered by the user.
- `j` is `L1[num] + 2`.
- `res` is a list containing all the values calculated based on the divisors of each element in `L1` from 2 to the respective element + 1.

The `print(*res, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the `res` list on a new line. Each element in `res` is calculated based on the divisors of the corresponding element in `L1`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `L1` are not specified, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **the divisors of each element in L1 from 2 to the respective element + 1, each on a new line**
