Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the second integer entered, `d` is the third integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `n` is \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\), `x` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), `a` and `b` are updated to the integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits the input string into two parts, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
