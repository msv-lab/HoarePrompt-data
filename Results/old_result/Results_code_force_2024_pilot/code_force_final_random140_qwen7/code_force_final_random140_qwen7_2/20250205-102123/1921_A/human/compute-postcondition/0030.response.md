Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `steps` is 3 (though `steps` is not used in the code snippet).
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are input integers.
- `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from the input split and converted to integers, respectively.
- `g` and `h` are the first and second integers from the input split and converted to integers, respectively.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)\).

The code snippet only prints `n`.

Given the formula for `n`, it will be the Euclidean distance squared between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\).

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n`, which is the squared Euclidean distance between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\).

Output: **(a - c)² + (b - d)²**
