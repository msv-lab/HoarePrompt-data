Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `n` is (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)**.

The code calculates `n` as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `c`, and `b` and `d`. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
