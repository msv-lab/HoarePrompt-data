Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the second integer entered, `d` is the third integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `n` is \((a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)\)**

Explanation: The code `c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them, assigning the first to `c` and the second to `d`. The values of `a`, `b`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
