Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is updated with the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `f` is updated with the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer.**

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to `g` and `h`. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
