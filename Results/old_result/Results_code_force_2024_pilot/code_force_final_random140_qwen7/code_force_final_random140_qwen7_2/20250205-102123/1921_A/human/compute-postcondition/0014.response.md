Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `n` is \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\)**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them, converting each to an integer. These values are assigned to `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `steps` is updated to 2 because the input operation has been performed.
