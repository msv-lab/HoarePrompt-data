Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is equal to `t` (the total number of test cases), `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers corresponding to the inputs provided for each test case, `n` is the value of \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\) for the last test case, and `x` is the value of \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\) for the last test case. If \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\) is greater than \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\) for the last test case, then `x` remains as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\). Otherwise, `x` remains as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `n` will hold the minimum distance squared calculated for the last test case, and `x` will either be the same as `n` or the maximum distance squared calculated for the last test case, depending on which is larger.
