Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `n` is (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d), `x` is (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)**.

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, which is the Euclidean distance squared between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
