Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is equal to `t`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `f` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `g` is the first integer from the input split and converted to integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split and converted to integer, `n` is (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d), `x` is (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f). After all iterations, if any `x > n` during the loop, the maximum value among all `n` and `x` will be printed; otherwise, the minimum value among all `n` and `x` will be printed for each iteration.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the final output will be the maximum value of `n` or `x` encountered during the loop if there was at least one instance where `x > n`, otherwise, it will be the minimum value of `n` or `x` encountered.
