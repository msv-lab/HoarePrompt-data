Reasoning:
The given program attempts to calculate the area of a square by finding the squared distance between the first and third corner, and the first and fourth corner. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the correct pairs of points that form the sides of the square. Instead, it should identify the correct pairs of points that are opposite corners of the square and calculate the squared distance between them, which would be the side length squared.

Given the constraints and the fact that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the correct approach would be to identify the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among the four points. This difference will represent the side length of the square.

The current implementation does not correctly identify the pairs of points that form the diagonals of the square. It simply takes the squared distance between the first and third point, and the first and fourth point, which may not be the correct diagonals.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
