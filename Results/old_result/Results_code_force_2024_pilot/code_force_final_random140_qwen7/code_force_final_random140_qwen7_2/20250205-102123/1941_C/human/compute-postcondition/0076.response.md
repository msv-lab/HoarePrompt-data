Output State: **`a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is 0; `i` is 1; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring `a[0:3]` of `a`; `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `s` is now updated to `a[i:i + 3]` which is `a[1:4]`, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

Explanation: The variable `i` was originally set to 0 and was incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The substring `s` is updated to `a[1:4]` because `i` is now 1, and the condition that `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie' remains true.
