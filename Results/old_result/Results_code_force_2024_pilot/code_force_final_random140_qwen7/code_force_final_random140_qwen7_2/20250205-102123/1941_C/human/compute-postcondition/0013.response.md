To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

1. The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must satisfy this condition after the adjustment.

Given the current state:
- `a` is the input string provided by the user.
- `ans` is 1 if the first 3 characters of `a` are either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 3 if the first 3 characters are 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1.

We need to ensure that `i < len(a) - 2` after the adjustment. Let's consider both cases for `i`:

### Case 1: `i` is 3
- If `i` is 3, then for the loop to execute one more time, `3 < len(a) - 2` must hold true.
- Simplifying the inequality: `3 < len(a) - 2` becomes `5 < len(a)`, meaning `len(a)` must be greater than 5.

### Case 2: `i` is 1
- If `i` is 1, then for the loop to execute one more time, `1 < len(a) - 2` must hold true.
- Simplifying the inequality: `1 < len(a) - 2` becomes `3 < len(a)`, meaning `len(a)` must be greater than 3.

Since the loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`, and `i` can be either 1 or 3 based on the conditions given, the most general requirement is that `len(a)` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can execute one more time regardless of the value of `i`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)`.

State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user and `len(a)` must be greater than 3**
