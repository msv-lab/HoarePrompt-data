Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` slices the string `a` starting from index `i` (which is initially 0) and takes the next 3 characters. This slice is stored in the variable `s`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `num_iterations`) remain unchanged.
