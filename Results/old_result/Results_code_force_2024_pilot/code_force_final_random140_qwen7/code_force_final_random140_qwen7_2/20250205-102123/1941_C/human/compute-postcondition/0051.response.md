Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is either 1 or 0; `i` is 4 or 2; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring from index `i` to `i+3` of `a`; `len(a)` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially either 3 or 1, after executing `i += 1`, `i` will now be either 4 (if it was originally 3) or 2 (if it was originally 1). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
