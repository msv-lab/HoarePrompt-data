Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 3, `i` is now `i + 3`, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i + 3` and ending at index `i + 5`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, so its value becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
