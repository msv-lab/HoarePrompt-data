Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) for each t, and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function iterates over a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer t, another integer n, and a string s. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
