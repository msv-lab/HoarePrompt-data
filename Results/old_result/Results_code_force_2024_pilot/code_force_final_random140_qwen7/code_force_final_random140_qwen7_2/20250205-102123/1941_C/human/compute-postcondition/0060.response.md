Postcondition: `a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is either 3, 2, or 1; `i` is either 7 or 5; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring 'a'[i:i+3] of `a`; `len(a)` must be greater than 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is either 2, 1, or 0; `i` is either 5 or 3.
