Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Substring Check**: The program checks substrings of length 3 (`a[i:i+3]`) but the problem requires checking for the exact substrings "pie" and "map". Therefore, the logic inside the `if` statement should directly check for these exact substrings, not a general substring of length 3.

2. **Printing Statements**: The program includes unnecessary `print(s)` statements which are not required for the solution and might cause confusion. These should be removed.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, if the string ends with "pie" or "map", the current logic might miss those cases because it stops at `len(a) - 2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input().strip()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i <= len(a) - 3:
            if a[i:i+3] == 'pie' or a[i:i+3] == 'map':
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
