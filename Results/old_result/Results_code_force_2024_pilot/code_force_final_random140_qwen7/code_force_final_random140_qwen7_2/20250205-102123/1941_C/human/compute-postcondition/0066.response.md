Output State: **`a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is 0; `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i` is at most `len(a) - 3` and `i` will be incremented by 1; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring `a[i:i+3]` of `a` and will be updated to `a[i+1:i+4]` for the next iteration.**

The code initializes `ans` to 0, which is a specific value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
