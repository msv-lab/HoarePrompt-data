Output State: **`a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring `a[0:3]` of `a`; `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `s` is now updated to `a[i:i + 3]` which is `a[0:3]`**.

This means that the variable `s` has been updated to the substring of `a` from index 0 to 2 (inclusive), while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
