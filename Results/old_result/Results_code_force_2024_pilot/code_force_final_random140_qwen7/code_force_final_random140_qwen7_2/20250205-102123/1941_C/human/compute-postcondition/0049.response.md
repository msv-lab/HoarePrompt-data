Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user; `ans` is either 1 or 0; `i` is 4 or 4; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring from index `i` to `i+3` of `a`; `len(a)` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Given that `i` was originally either 3 or 1, after adding 3, `i` becomes 4 in both cases. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
