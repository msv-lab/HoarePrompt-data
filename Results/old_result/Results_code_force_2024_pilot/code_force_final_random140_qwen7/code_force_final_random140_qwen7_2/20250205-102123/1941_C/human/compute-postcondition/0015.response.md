Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input string provided by the user, and it is guaranteed that `len(a)` is greater than 3.
- `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`.

The substring `s` is defined as a part of the string `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact characters in `s`. However, we know that `s` consists of three consecutive characters from `a`.

Therefore, the output will be a substring of `a` consisting of three consecutive characters starting from index `i`.

Output: **a[i:i+3]**
