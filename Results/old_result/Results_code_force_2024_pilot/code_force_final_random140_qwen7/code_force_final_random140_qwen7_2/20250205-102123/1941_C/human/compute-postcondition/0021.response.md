Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 3, `i` is such that after incrementing by 3 or 1, it is still less than `len(a) - 2`; `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the string `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. The conditions on `a` and `i` remain unchanged, and `s` is now defined as the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`.
