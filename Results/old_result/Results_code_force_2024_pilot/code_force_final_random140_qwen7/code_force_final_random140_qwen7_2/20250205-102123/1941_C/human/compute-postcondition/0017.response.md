Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user and `len(a)` must be greater than 3; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i + 3` and ending at index `i + 5`; `i` is increased by 3; `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, making its value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The substring `s` is still defined as a substring of `a` starting from index `i + 3` and ending at index `i + 5`. The precondition that `len(a)` must be greater than 3 and `i` is increased by 3 are also preserved.
