Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Substrings 'map' and 'pie' are not properly handled**: The program attempts to check every possible substring of length 3 (`a[i:i+3]`) starting from index `i`. However, this approach only checks for 'map' and 'pie' when they appear exactly at the start of these 3-character segments. It fails to consider cases where 'map' or 'pie' might be split across multiple segments.

2. **Counting deletions**: The program increments `ans` whenever it finds 'map' or 'pie' in the current segment. This means it will increment `ans` even if 'map' or 'pie' overlaps with previous segments, leading to an incorrect count of deletions needed.

3. **Logic for deletion**: The program simply moves the index `i` forward by 3 positions when it finds 'map' or 'pie', which is not optimal. Instead, it should skip over the entire segment containing 'map' or 'pie' to ensure the minimum number of deletions.

4. **Output format**: The program prints the intermediate results of `s` (which are the 3-character segments being checked), but it does not return or print the final result for each test case as required.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
