Output State: **`a` is the input string provided by the user, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 0, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `a`, `i`, `num_iterations`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
