Postcondition: **`a` is the new input string provided by the user; `ans` is 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0; `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1; `num_iterations` is the original input value minus 1; `s` is the substring `a[0:3]` of `a`; `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` and `s` is now updated to `a[i:i + 3]` which is `a[0:3]` if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a[1:4]`.**
