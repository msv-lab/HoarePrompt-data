Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0 if `i` is not in `b`, otherwise `bOnes` is 1, `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in both sets `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` remains 1, `aOnes` remains 0, and `bOnes` becomes 1. If `i` is not in either set or only in one of them, `leftOnes` remains 1, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are updated based on the presence of `i` in `a` and `b`.**
