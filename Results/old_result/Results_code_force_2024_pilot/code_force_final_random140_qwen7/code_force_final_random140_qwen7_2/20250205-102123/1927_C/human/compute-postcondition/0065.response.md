Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < leftOnes`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `leftOnes` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that:
   - If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is set to `bOnes + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `leftOnes` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Currently, `i` is 1, so `leftOnes` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable that affects the loop condition is `leftOnes`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `leftOnes` is greater than 1.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `leftOnes` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1, otherwise `bOnes` is incremented by 1**
