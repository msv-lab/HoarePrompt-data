Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`. `i` is in `a` and either `i` is not in `b` or `i` is in `b` but not both.**

Explanation: The line `aOnes += 1` increments the value of `aOnes` by 1. Since `aOnes` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
