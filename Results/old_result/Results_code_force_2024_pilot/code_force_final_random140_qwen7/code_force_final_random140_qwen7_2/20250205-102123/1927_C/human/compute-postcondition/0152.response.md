Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`, otherwise `aOnes` is incremented by 1.**

This means that `i` is incremented by 1, and the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged unless `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, in which case `aOnes` is incremented by 1.
