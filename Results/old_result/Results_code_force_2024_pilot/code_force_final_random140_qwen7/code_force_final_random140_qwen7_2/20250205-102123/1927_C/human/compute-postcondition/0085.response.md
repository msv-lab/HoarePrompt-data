Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `aOnes` is either incremented by 1 from its previous value (if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` at the start of the iteration) or remains unchanged, `bOnes` is either incremented by 1 from its previous value (if `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes` at the start of the iteration) or remains unchanged, and `leftOnes` is 0; `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

This output state reflects that the variables `t`, `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, and `leftOnes` retain their initial values or conditions. The new variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the input split into integers.
