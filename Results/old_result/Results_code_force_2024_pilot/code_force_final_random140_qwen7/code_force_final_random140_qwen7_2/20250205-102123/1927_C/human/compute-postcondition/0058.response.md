Output State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1**

Explanation: The code `aOnes += 1` increments the value of `aOnes` by 1. Given the initial condition that `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, after incrementing `aOnes`, it becomes `bOnes + 1`. The other variables (`leftOnes` and `i`) remain unchanged.
