#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is the last integer input for the test case, `m` is the last integer input for the test case, `k` is the last integer input divided by 2, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the last input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the next input split by spaces, `leftOnes` is the count of elements present in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the count of elements present in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the count of elements present in `b` but not in `a`. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, the program prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no' and increments `t` for the next test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it checks if the counts of common elements and unique elements in \( a \) and \( b \) can be evenly split into two groups of size \( \frac{k}{2} \). If such a split is possible, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function iterates through all test cases, updating the counts and performing the necessary comparisons for each one.
