Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= k`.
2. **Current values of the loop variables**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `k` is an integer from the input, and `newk` is `k // 2`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= k` must be true.

Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute as long as `1 <= k` is true. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` itself.

Since `k` is an integer from the input, and `i` is already 1, the loop will definitely execute the first time as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

Thus, no additional adjustments are necessary for the given states.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`**
