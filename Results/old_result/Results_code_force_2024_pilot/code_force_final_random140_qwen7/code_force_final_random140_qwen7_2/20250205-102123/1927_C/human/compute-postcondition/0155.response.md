Output State: **`i` must be less than `leftOnes - 1`; `bOnes` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1. The condition that `i` must be less than `leftOnes - 1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `bOnes` and the unchanged condition on `i`.
