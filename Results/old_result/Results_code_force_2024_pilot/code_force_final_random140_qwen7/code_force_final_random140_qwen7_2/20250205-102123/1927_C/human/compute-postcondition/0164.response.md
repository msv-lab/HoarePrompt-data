Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `i` will be equal to `leftOnes`, `aOnes` will be incremented by 1 as many times as `aOnes` is less than `bOnes` during the loop, and `bOnes` will be incremented by 1 as many times as `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes` during the loop. Additionally, either `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, or `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` and/or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.**
