Output State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1, otherwise `bOnes` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 0, so now it is 1. The conditions involving `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` remain unchanged from the initial state.
