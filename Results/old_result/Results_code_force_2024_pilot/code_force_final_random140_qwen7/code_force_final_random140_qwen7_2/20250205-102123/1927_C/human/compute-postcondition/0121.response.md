Postcondition: `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2 (if `i` is in `b`), or `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 (otherwise), `newk` is `k` divided by 2, and `k` must be at least 2. Additionally, if `i` is not in `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
