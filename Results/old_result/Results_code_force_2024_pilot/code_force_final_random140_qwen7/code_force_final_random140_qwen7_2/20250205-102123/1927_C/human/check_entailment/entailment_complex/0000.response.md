Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly defines the function to process multiple test cases. Each test case involves determining if it's possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included.
- The function uses sets (`frozenset`) to store the elements of arrays \(a\) and \(b\), which allows for efficient checking of membership.
- The logic to count the number of elements present in both sets, in \(a\) but not in \(b\), and in \(b\) but not in \(a\) is implemented correctly.
- The function then checks if it's possible to distribute these counts equally between the two sets to achieve the required condition.
- The overall structure and logic of the function align with the problem statement and examples provided.

However, there are a few potential issues:
1. The function does not handle the case where \(k\) is odd, although the problem guarantees \(k\) is even.
2. The function does not account for the possibility that some elements might not be present in either set, which could lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.
3. The function assumes that the input constraints are met, but it does not explicitly validate the input.

Despite these minor concerns, the core logic of the function appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
