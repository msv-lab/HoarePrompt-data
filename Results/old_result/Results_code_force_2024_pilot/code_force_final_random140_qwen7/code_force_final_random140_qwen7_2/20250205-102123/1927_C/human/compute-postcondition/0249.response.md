Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it checks if the counts of common elements and unique elements in \( a \) and \( b \) can be evenly split into two groups of size \( \frac{k}{2} \). If such a split is possible, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function iterates through all test cases, updating the counts and performing the necessary comparisons for each one.**
