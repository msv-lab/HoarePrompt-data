Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `aOnes` is either incremented by 1 from its previous value (if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` at the start of the iteration) or remains unchanged, `bOnes` is either incremented by 1 from its previous value (if `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes` at the start of the iteration) or remains unchanged, and `leftOnes` is 0; `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer; `a` is a frozenset of integers obtained from user input; `b` is a frozenset of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converts each integer to an int, and creates a frozenset `b` from these integers. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `leftOnes`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
