Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `aOnes` must be less than `bOnes` or they both satisfy the condition where one is incremented by 1 based on their comparison, and `leftOnes` remains unchanged, `bOnes` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `leftOnes - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. The conditions involving `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `leftOnes`, and `i` remain the same as they were before, except now `bOnes` has been incremented.
