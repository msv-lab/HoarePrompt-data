Postcondition: `leftOnes` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` must be at least 1, `a` is a frozenset, `b` is a frozenset, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`. This is because if `i` is in `b`, `bOnes` becomes 1; otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and the loop or conditional block ends, ensuring `i` is not added to either set.
