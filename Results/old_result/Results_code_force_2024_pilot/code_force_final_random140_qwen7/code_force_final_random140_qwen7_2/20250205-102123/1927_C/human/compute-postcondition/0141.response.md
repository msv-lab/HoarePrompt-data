Output State: **`aOnes` is `aOnes + 1`, `i` must be less than `leftOnes`, where `leftOnes` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `k`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`**.

This means that `aOnes` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions involving `i`, `leftOnes`, and the comparison between `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged.
