Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `leftOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, and `k` must be at least 4. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
