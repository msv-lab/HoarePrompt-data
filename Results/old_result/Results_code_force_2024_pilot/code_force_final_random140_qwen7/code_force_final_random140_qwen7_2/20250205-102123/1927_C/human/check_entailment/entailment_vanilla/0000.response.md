### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to check if we can select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of the two sets (`a` and `b`) such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the selected elements.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The program uses `frozenset` to store the elements of arrays `a` and `b`, which is efficient for membership testing.
   - It iterates through numbers from 1 to \( k \) and checks their presence in both sets.
   - It counts how many times each number appears in `a` and `b`.
   - After counting, it tries to balance the counts to ensure that both sets have at least \( \frac{k}{2} \) of each number.

3. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The logic for balancing the counts is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the distribution of elements to ensure that both sets meet the requirement.
   - The code breaks out of the loop early if a number is not found in either set, which might lead to incorrect conclusions.
   - The final check to see if both sets have at least \( \frac{k}{2} \) of each number is also problematic because it does not account for the possibility of distributing elements across different numbers.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to ensure that we can distribute the elements such that both sets have at least \( \frac{k}{2} \) of each number from 1 to \( k \).
   - A more robust approach would involve checking if the union of the two sets contains all numbers from 1 to \( k \) and ensuring that the count of each number in the combined set meets the requirement.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
