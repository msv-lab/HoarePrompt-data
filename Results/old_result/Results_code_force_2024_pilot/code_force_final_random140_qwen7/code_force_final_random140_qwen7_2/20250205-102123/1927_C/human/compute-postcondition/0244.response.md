Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` is the count of elements present in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the count of elements present in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the count of elements present in `b` but not in `a`, and either `aOnes` or `bOnes` is incremented each iteration based on their comparison, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `(aOnes != newk or bOnes != newk)`**
