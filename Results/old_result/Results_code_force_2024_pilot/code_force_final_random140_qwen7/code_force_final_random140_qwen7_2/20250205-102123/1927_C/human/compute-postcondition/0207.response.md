Output State: **`i` is 3; `k` must be at least 4; `leftOnes` is 1**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and `k` must still be at least 4. The variable `leftOnes` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (but since no initial value is given, we assume it was 0 before this line of code), making its value 1.
