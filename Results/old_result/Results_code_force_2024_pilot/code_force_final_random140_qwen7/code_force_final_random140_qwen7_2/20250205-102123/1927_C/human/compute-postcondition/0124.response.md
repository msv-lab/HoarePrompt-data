Postcondition: `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, and `k` must be at least 2. If `i` is found in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is found in `a`, then `aOnes` remains 1. If `i` is found in `b`, then `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not found in either `a` or `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
