Output State: **`t` is now equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `bOnes = 0` initializes the variable `bOnes` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. `leftOnes` and `aOnes` also remain 0.
