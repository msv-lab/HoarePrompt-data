Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive), a list of n integers a, a list of m integers b, and two integers n and m (both between 1 and 2⋅10^5 inclusive). Additionally, k is an even integer between 2 and 2⋅min(n, m) inclusive. The function also guarantees that the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4⋅10^5. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not detailed in the given information.**
