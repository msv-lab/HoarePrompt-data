Output State: **`t` is now equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The initial state of `t` is `t + 1` and still less than `int(input())`. After executing `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())`, `t` is updated to be `int(input()) - 1`. The input is split into three integers, which are assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively.
