Output State: **`leftOnes` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `bOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1**

Explanation: The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. The conditions and values of `leftOnes` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `leftOnes` must still be greater than 1, `i` remains 1, and `bOnes` is now one more than its original value.
