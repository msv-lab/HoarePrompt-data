Postcondition: `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, `leftOnes` is 0, and if `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in `a` but is in `b`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `b`, then `bOnes` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
