Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `aOnes` is either `aOnes` + 1 (if `aOnes` < `bOnes`) or remains unchanged; `bOnes` is `bOnes` + 1; `leftOnes` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. The conditions for updating `aOnes` and `bOnes` based on their comparison remain unchanged, but since `bOnes` is explicitly incremented, its new value is `bOnes + 1`. The values of `i` and `leftOnes` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
