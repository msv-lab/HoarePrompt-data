Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the actual values are not provided, we can only state that these variables now hold the integers entered by the user. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
