Output State: **`leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` must be at least 4, `a` is a frozenset, `b` is a frozenset, `aOnes` is 0 or 1, `bOnes` is 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Since `bOnes` was initially either 0 or 1, incrementing it by 1 means it will now be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
