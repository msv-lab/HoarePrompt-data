Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `aOnes` is either incremented by 1 from its previous value (if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` at the start of the iteration) or remains unchanged, `bOnes` is either incremented by 1 from its previous value (if `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes` at the start of the iteration) or remains unchanged, and `leftOnes` is 0. The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` may or may not be true.**
