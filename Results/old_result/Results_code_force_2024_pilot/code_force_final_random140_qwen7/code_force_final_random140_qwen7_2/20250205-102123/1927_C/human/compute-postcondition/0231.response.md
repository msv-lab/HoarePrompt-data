Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1, `aOnes` is the count of elements present in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1, `newk` is `k // 2`**

Explanation: The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
