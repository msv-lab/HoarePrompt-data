Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `leftOnes`.
- `t` is `int(input()) - 1`.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input.
- `a` is a frozenset containing integers from the input split by spaces.
- `b` is a frozenset containing integers from the new input split by spaces.
- `leftOnes` is the count of elements present in both `a` and `b`.
- `aOnes` is the count of elements present in `a` but not in `b`.
- `bOnes` is the count of elements present in `b` but not in `a`.
- `aOnes` is equal to `newk`.
- `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.

The `print('yes')` statement will simply print the string "yes".

Output: **yes**
