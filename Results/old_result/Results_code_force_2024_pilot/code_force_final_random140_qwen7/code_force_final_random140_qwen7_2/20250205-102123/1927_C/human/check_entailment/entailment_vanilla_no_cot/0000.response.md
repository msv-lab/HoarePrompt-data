Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Elements**: The code only checks if the current element `i` is present in both sets `a` and `b`, or just one of them. It does not ensure that all numbers from 1 to `k` are covered by choosing exactly `k/2` elements from each set.

2. **Break Statement**: The `break` statement inside the loop causes the loop to terminate prematurely if an element is not found in either set. This means the loop may not complete if there are gaps in the sequence from 1 to `k`.

3. **Logic for Ensuring All Numbers are Covered**: The logic to ensure that all numbers from 1 to `k` are covered by choosing exactly `k/2` elements from each set is flawed. The code does not correctly handle the distribution of elements between `a` and `b` to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.

4. **Output Format**: The output should be in uppercase ("YES" or "NO"), but the code prints "yes" and "no" without converting to uppercase.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that you can cover all numbers from 1 to `k` by choosing exactly `k/2` elements from each set. A more appropriate approach would involve checking if the union of the two sets contains at least `k` distinct elements and then ensuring that you can distribute these elements between the two sets to meet the requirement.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = set(map(int, input().split()))
        b = set(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the union of sets a and b contains at least k distinct elements
        if len(a.union(b)) >= k:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution first checks if the union of sets `a` and `b` contains at least `k` distinct elements. If it does, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This ensures that it is possible to choose the required elements from each set to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
