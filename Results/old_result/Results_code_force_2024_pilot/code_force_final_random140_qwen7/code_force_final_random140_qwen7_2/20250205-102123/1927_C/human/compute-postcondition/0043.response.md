Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i <= k`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `k` must be at least 3.
   - `a` is a frozenset.
   - `b` is a frozenset.
   - `aOnes` is 0 or 1.
   - `bOnes` is 0 or 1.
   - `newk` is `k // 2`.
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `k`.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is 3, for the loop to continue, `k` must be at least 4 (since `i` is already 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4).

6. **Other Variables**:
   - The values of `leftOnes`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, and `newk` do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be at least 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` must be at least 4, `a` is a frozenset, `b` is a frozenset, `aOnes` is 0 or 1, `bOnes` is 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3**
