Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is equal to `n` + 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The input integer is stored in `n`.
