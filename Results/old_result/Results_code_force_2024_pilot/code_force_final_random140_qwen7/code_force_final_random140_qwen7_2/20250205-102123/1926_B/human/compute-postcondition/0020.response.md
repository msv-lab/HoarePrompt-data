Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either 'Square' or an empty string, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code snippet `a = 'Triangle'` assigns the string `'Triangle'` to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` from its previous state (either 'Triangle' or 0) to 'Triangle'. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
