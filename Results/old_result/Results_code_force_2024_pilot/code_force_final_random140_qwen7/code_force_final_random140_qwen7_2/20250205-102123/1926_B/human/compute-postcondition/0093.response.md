Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an updated input string, `a` is 'Triangle', `j` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'Triangle'` to the variable `a`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, or `j`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and the relationship between `j` and `k` remain unchanged.
