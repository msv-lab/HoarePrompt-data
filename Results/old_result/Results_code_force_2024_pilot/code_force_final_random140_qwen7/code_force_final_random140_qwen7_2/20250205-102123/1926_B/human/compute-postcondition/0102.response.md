Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 'Square', `b` is 'Square'**.

The code simply reassigns `b` to the string `'Square'`. Since `b` was already `'Square'` before the assignment, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
