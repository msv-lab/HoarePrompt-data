Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is the string 'Triangle'.
- `b` is the string 'Square'.
- `j` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(b)
```

Here, `b` is explicitly defined as the string 'Square'. Therefore, when the `print(b)` statement is executed, it will print the string 'Square'.

Output: **Square**
