Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to identify whether a given grid contains a triangle or a square made up of '1's. However, there are several issues with the logic implemented in the program:

1. **Incorrect Shape Detection Logic**: 
   - The program checks if each row contains exactly one '1' to identify a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have more than one '1' per row as long as they are aligned vertically.
   - Similarly, the program checks if each row contains more than one '1' to identify a square. This is also incorrect because a square can have more than one '1' per row as long as they are evenly spaced horizontally.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Shapes**:
   - The program only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', but it does not verify the alignment required for a triangle or a square.
   - For example, a row like "111" would be incorrectly identified as part of a square, even though it could be part of a triangle if the other rows align correctly.

3. **Lack of Verification for Triangle and Square**:
   - The program does not properly verify the structure of the shapes. It simply counts '1's in each row and makes a decision based on this count, without checking the actual alignment of the '1's.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly identify whether a grid contains a triangle or a square. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
