Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0
   - `b` is 'Square'
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was 1, for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains the same (must be greater than 0)
   - `i` remains the same (0)
   - `a` remains the same ('Triangle' or 0)
   - `b` remains the same ('Square')
   - `j` is incremented to 2
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
