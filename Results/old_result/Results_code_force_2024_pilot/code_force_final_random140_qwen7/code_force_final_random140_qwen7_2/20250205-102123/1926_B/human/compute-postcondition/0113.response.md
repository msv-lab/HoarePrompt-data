Output State: **t must be greater than 0, i is 3, a is either 'Triangle', 'Square', or 0, b is 'Square', j is equal to `n` + 1, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed (which is `t`), and `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The variable `a` will hold either 'Triangle', 'Square', or 0 based on the conditions inside the nested loop. Since the loop processes each `n` value provided by the user, `n` will be greater than or equal to `t`. The variable `b` remains 'Square' unless `a` is set to 'Triangle' in which case `b` will be overwritten. The variable `j` will be equal to `n` + 1 after the loop completes for each `n`. The variable `s` will be the last input string received during the final iteration of the loop.
