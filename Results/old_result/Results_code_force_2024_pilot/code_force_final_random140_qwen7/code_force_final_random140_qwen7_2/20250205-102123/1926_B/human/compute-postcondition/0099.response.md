Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `s` is an updated input string (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `a` is 'Square' (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `b` is 'Square' (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `j` is `k + 1`, where `k` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `j_prev`.
   - Therefore, `j` is now `j_prev + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j_prev + 1` must be less than `n`.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and assuming `j_prev` was less than `n` (otherwise the loop would have terminated), the next value of `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged).
- `j` is now `j_prev + 1`.
- `s`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `s` is an updated input string, `a` is 'Square', `b` is 'Square'**
