Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is the new input from the user. If the count of '1' in the string `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If the count of '1' in the string `s` is not exactly 1, then no changes are made to the variables.**
