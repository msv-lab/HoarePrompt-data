Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `b` is 'Square'**.

The code snippet `b = 'Square'` simply reassigns the value of `b` to 'Square'. Since `b` was already 'Square' in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
