Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and it is set to the integer input received.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100`, the output state maintains this condition but updates `t` to the specific integer input received.
