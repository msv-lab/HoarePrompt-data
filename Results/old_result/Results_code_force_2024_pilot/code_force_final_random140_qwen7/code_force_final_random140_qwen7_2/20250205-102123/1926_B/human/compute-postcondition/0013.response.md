Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `b = 'Square'` assigns the string `'Square'` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
