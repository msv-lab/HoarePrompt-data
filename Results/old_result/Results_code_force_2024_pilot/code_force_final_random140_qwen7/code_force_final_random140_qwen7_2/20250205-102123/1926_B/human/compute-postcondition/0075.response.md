Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', `j` is equal to `n` + 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution. If `a` is not 0, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is set to 'Triangle'.
