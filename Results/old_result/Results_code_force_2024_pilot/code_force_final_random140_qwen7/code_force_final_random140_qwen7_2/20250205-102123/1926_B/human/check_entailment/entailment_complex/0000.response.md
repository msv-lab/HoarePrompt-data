Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to identify whether a grid contains a triangle or a square made up of '1's.
2. However, the logic within the program is flawed. Specifically, the program checks only the first row for the presence of a single '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. This approach is incorrect because:
   - It does not account for the possibility of a triangle where more than one row might have a single '1'.
   - It does not check the necessary conditions for a square (equal number of '1's in each row).
3. The program should iterate through the entire grid to properly identify the shape. It needs to check both the row-wise and column-wise conditions for both a triangle and a square.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
