Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape on the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Triangle Detection**: 
   - The program checks if any row has exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes it's a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have more than one row with '1's, and these '1's should be aligned in a specific pattern.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic for Square Detection**:
   - The program checks if any row has more than one '1'. If so, it assumes it's a square. This is also incorrect because a square can have rows with more than one '1', but they must be evenly spaced.

3. **Combined Decision**:
   - The program combines both conditions in a way that doesn't accurately distinguish between a triangle and a square. For example, if there's a row with multiple '1's and another row with just one '1', the program will incorrectly identify it as a square.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly identify the shape, you need to check the alignment and distribution of '1's in the grid. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = []
        for _ in range(n):
            row = input().strip()
            grid.append(row)
        
        # Check for Triangle
        for k in range(2, n + 1):
            if all(grid[i][j] == '0' for j in range(k - 1)) and \
               all(grid[i][j] == '1' for j in range(k - 1, 2 * k - 2)) and \
               all(grid[i][j] == '0' for j in range(2 * k - 2, n)):
                print("TRIANGLE")
                break
        else:
            # Check for Square
            for k in range(2, n + 1):
                if all(grid[i][j] == '1' for i in range(k) for j in range(k) if (j - k // 2) ** 2 + (i - k // 2) ** 2 <= (k // 2) ** 2):
                    print("SQUARE")
                    break
            else:
                print("TRIANGLE")  # Fallback to triangle if no square is found

func()
```

This code checks for the correct patterns of '1's to identify either a triangle or a square.
