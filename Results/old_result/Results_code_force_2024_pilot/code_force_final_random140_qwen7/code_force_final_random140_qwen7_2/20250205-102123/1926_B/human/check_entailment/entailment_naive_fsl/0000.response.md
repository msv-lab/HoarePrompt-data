Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the following grid:
```
5

00000

00000

01110

01110

00000
```

This grid contains a triangle with `k=3`, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because it checks each row individually and finds only one row with a single '1'. The program does not check for the specific pattern required to form a triangle or a square across multiple rows.

To fix this, the program needs to check for the specific patterns of a triangle and a square across multiple rows, not just within individual rows.
