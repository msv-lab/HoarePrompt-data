Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an updated input string, `a` is 'Triangle' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, and `a` is 'Square' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to the new input string provided by the user. The conditions for `a` and `j` remain unchanged as they depend on the previous state and the value of `k`. The value of `n` remains unaffected and is still required to be greater than or equal to 1.
