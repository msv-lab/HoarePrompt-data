You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        n = x[0]
        a = x[1]
        b = x[2]
        profit = n * a
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        t -= 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        n = x[0]
        
        a = x[1]
        
        b = x[2]
        
        profit = n * a
        
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is equal to 0, and the output consists of the final profit value calculated for each test case after the loop has executed all its iterations.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The output will consist of the final profit values for each of the test cases processed, printed during each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified within the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a profit value based on the given conditions. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints the initial profit value `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a modified profit value using the formula `profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` where `k` is the minimum of `b - a` and `n - 1`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final profit values for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Initial Profit Calculation**: The program starts by calculating the initial profit assuming all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. This is done using `profit = n * a`.

2. **Condition Check**: It then checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If so, it directly prints the initial profit since selling all buns at the usual price would yield the highest profit.

3. **Optimal k Calculation**: If `a` is less than `b`, it calculates the value of `k` as `b - a` and ensures it does not exceed `n - 1`. This is because `k` represents the number of buns sold at the modified price, and `k` cannot be more than `n - 1`.

4. **Profit Adjustment**: The program adjusts the profit by adding the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and subtracting the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to `k`. This ensures the maximum profit is calculated correctly.

5. **Output**: Finally, the adjusted profit is printed.

Given the logic, the program handles all potential cases correctly. For instance:
- When `a >= b`, the program correctly returns the initial profit.
- When `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` and adjusts the profit accordingly.

Since no specific edge cases were found where the program fails to meet the problem description, the program is correct.
