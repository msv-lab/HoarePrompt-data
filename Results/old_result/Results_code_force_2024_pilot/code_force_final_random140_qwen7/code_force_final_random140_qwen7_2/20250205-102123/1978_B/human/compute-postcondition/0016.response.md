Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with the first element being `n`, the second element being `a`, and the third element being `b`, and `profit` is updated as follows: if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `profit` remains `n * a`. Otherwise, `profit` is updated to `profit + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2`.
