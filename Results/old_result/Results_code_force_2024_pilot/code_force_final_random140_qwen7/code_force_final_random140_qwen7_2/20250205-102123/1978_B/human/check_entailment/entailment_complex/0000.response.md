Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic to calculate the maximum profit is correct:
   - If `a >= b`, the profit is simply `n * a` because there's no benefit in reducing the price.
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` to maximize profit. The formula used to calculate the profit when `a < b` is also correct:
     - `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`
     - Here, `k` is the minimum of `b - a` and `n - 1`.
4. The program correctly handles the decrement of `t` after processing each test case.
5. The output format matches the problem statement requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and implementation are correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
