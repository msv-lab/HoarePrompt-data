You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        n = x[0]
        
        a = x[1]
        
        b = x[2]
        
        profit = n * a
        
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is equal to 0, and the output consists of the final profit value calculated for each test case after the loop has executed all its iterations.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The output will consist of the final profit values for each of the test cases processed, printed during each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified within the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where each test case includes three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
