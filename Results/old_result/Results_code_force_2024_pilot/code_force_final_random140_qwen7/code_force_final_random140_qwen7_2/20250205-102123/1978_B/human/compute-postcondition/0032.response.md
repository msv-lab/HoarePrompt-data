Output State: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers `[n, a, b]`, `n` is equal to `x[0]`, `a` is equal to `x[1]`, `b` is equal to `x[2]`, and `profit` is equal to `n * a + (b - a) * k - k * (k - 1) / 2`, where `k` is equal to `min(n - 1, b - a)` if `a < b`.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, while the values of `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit` remain unchanged. The condition for calculating `profit` remains the same as well.
