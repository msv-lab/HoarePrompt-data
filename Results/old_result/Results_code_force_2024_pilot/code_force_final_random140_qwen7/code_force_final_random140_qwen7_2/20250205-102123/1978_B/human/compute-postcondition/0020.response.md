The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. This means the values of `t`, `x`, and `profit` are affected.

- `t` is still greater than 0.
- `x` is now a list of integers, specifically containing three integers: the first one is `n`, the second one is `a`, and the third one is `b`.
- `profit` remains unchanged unless the conditions inside the code block are met.

Since the code does not directly modify `profit`, its value remains as per the initial condition: if `a >= b`, `profit` is `n * a`; otherwise, `profit` is updated according to the given formula.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers [n, a, b], and `profit` is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or `profit + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2` if `a < b`.**
