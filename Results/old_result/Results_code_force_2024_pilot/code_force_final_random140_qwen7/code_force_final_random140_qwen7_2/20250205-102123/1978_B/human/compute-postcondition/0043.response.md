Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be non-zero (though `t` is not used in the calculation).
   - `x` is a list of integers where:
     - The second element is stored in `a`.
     - The first element is stored in `n`.
     - The third element is stored in `b`.
   - `k` is defined as `min(n - 1, b - a)`.
   - `profit` is defined as `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.

2. **Calculation of Variables:**
   - `k = min(n - 1, b - a)`: This means `k` takes the minimum value between `n - 1` and `b - a`.
   - `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`: This formula calculates the profit based on the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`.

3. **Final Expression for Profit:**
   - Substitute the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` into the profit formula to get the exact value.

Given the initial state, let's assume specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b` to illustrate the calculation. For simplicity, let's assume:
- `n = 5` (first element of `x`)
- `a = 2` (second element of `x`)
- `b = 7` (third element of `x`)

Now, calculate `k`:
- `k = min(5 - 1, 7 - 2) = min(4, 5) = 4`

Next, calculate `profit`:
- `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`
- `profit = 5 * 2 + (7 - 2) * (4 + 1) - 4 * (4 + 1) / 2`
- `profit = 10 + 5 * 5 - 4 * 5 / 2`
- `profit = 10 + 25 - 10`
- `profit = 25`

Therefore, the print statement will output the integer value of `profit`, which is `25`.

Output: **25**
