Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with the first element being `n`, the second element being `a`, and the third element being `b`, and `profit` is `profit + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `profit` is updated by adding `(b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` to its current value, where `k` is defined as `min(n - 1, b - a)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
