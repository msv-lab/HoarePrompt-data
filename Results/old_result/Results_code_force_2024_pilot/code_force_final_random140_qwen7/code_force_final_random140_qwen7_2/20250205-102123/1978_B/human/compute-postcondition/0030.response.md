Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers [n, a, b], `n` is equal to `x[0]`, `a` is equal to `x[1]`, `b` is equal to `x[2]`, and `profit` is equal to `n * a + max(0, min(n - 1, b - a)) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - max(0, min(n - 1, b - a)) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2`.

In simpler terms, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers [n, a, b], `n` is equal to `x[0]`, `a` is equal to `x[1]`, `b` is equal to `x[2]`, and `profit` is calculated as follows: if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `profit` remains `n * a`. Otherwise, `profit` is updated to `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`, where `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.
