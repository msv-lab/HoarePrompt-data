Postcondition: `t` must be non-zero, `x` is a list of integers where the second element is stored in `a`, `n` is the first element of the list `x`, `b` is the third element of the list `x`, `profit` is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` where `k = min(n - 1, b - a)` if `a < b`.
