Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers [n, a, b], `n` is equal to `x[0]`, `a` is equal to `x[1]`, `b` is equal to `x[2]`, and `profit` is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or `profit + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2` if `a < b`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `x[2]` to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The expression for `profit` also remains the same based on the condition whether `a >= b` or `a < b`.
