Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 - 1, `x` is a list of integers with the first element being `n`, the second element being `a`, and the third element being `b`, and `profit` is updated as follows: if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `profit` remains `n * a`; otherwise, `profit` is updated to `profit + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now greater than 0 - 1. The other variables (`x` and `profit`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
