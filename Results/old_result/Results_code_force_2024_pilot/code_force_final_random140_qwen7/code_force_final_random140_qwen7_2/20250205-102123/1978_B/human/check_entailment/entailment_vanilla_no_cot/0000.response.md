Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The initial profit is set to `n * a`, which is the profit if all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - If `a >= b`, then no modification to the usual price is beneficial, so the profit remains `n * a`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the optimal value of `k` (the number of buns to be sold at the modified price).
     - `k` is determined as `b - a` if it is less than `n - 1`, otherwise `k = n - 1`.
   - The profit is then updated by adding the revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices and subtracting the cost of these sales (using the arithmetic series sum formula).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all scenarios and provides the expected output. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
