Output State: **`j` is 3, `c` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j` and `c`. It only indicates that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional block. The value of `j` remains 3, and `c` is decreased by 1 as per the initial state, but the exact new value of `c` is not specified. The `break` statement itself does not assign a new value to `c`, it just indicates the exit condition. Therefore, the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
