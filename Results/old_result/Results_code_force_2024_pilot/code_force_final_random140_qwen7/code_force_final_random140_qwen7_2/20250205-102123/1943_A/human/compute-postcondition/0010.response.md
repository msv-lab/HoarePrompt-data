Output State: The variable `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and for each index `i` in the list `a`, the value of `cntl[i]` is increased by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` for each `i` in `a` will reflect the total count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cntl` list will contain the count of each integer present in the list `a`. Each element in `cntl` at index `i` will hold the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.
