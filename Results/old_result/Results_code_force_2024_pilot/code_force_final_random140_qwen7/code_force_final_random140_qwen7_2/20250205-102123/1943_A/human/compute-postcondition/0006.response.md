Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. After each iteration, `i` takes the value of the next element in the list `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from the list `a`, after the previous iteration, `i` would be the first element of the list `a`.
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still contain at least one element (since `a` is initially non-empty).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `a` must still be a non-empty list of integers.
   - `i` will now be the second element of the list `a` (the next element after the previous iteration).
   - `cntl[i]` will be increased by 1 again in the next iteration.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1**.
