Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`, and it does not ensure that Alice always picks an element before Bob. Instead, the program simply counts occurrences of each number in the array and then determines the MEX based on these counts, which does not reflect the game's rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
```

The correct output should be:
```
2
1
```

However, the program will produce the following output:
```
0
0
```

This is incorrect because:
- In the first test case, after Alice picks 0, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, and Bob picks 1, the array `c` should be `[0, 1]`, which has an MEX of 2.
- In the second test case, after Alice picks 0, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, and Bob picks 3, the array `c` should be `[0, 1, 2]`, which has an MEX of 3, but the program incorrectly outputs 0.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game's rules and is thus incorrect.
