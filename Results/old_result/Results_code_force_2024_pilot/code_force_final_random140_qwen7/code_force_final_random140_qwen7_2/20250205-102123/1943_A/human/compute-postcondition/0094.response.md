Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
3. **Analyze the given postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and after executing the if-else block, either `cntl[j]` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 1 and `c` is 0, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these points, let's consider what needs to happen for the loop to continue:

- For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented from its current value (which is 1) to the next value.
- Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop runs up to `n`, the next value of `j` would be 2.
- The variable `n` must still satisfy the condition that it is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `j` being incremented to 2 and `n` still being greater than 0.

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
