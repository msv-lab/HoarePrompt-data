Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the array \( a \) and stores these counts in the `cntl` array. If the count of the integer 0 in the array \( a \) is zero, it prints 0. Otherwise, it finds the smallest integer \( j \) (other than 0) whose count is less than 2 and prints \( j \). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.**
