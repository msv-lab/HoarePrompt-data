Postcondition: `cntl` is an array where the value at each index `i` from the list `a` is increased by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`, and `a` is an empty list since it has been fully processed. This holds true whether `cntl[0]` is 0 or not, as the else part indicates the loop has executed all its iterations.
