The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

Since `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `j` by 1 makes it 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 3 because `j` must be within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is 3 and `n` is at least 3.

State: **`j` is 3, `c` is decreased by 1, and `n` is at least 3**
