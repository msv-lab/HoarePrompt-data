Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All the initial conditions remain valid and unchanged.
