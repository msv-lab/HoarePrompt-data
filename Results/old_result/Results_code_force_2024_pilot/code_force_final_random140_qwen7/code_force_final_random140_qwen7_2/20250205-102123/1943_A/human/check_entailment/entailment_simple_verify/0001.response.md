### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure it correctly implements the game logic and calculates the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It creates a count array `cntl` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - This is done using `cntl[i] += 1` for each element `i` in `a`.

3. **Determining the Initial MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0` immediately, indicating that `0` is the MEX.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`, meaning Alice can place at most 2 zeros in `c`.

4. **Calculating the MEX:**
   - It iterates through the elements from `1` to `n` and checks the count of each element.
   - If any element `j` appears less than 2 times, it updates `c` accordingly.
   - If `c` becomes `0`, it means the MEX is `j` and it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case 1: `0 0 1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `2`, `c` is set to `2`.
- The loop checks elements from `1` to `2` and finds no element with count less than `2`.
- Therefore, the output should be `2`.

#### Test Case 2: `0 1 2 3`
- `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `1`, `c` is set to `1`.
- The loop checks elements from `1` to `3` and finds no element with count less than `2`.
- Therefore, the output should be `1`.

#### Test Case 3: `1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `0`, it directly prints `0`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Handling of Alice's and Bob's Moves:**
   - The program does not simulate the actual game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.
   - Instead, it only counts the occurrences of each element and determines the MEX based on these counts.
   - This approach does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The current implementation does not consider the sequence of moves and the strategic placement of elements by Alice and Bob.
   - For example, in the first test case, the optimal strategy would involve Alice placing `0`s in `c` and Bob removing elements strategically to minimize the MEX.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. It only counts the occurrences of elements and determines the MEX based on these counts, which does not reflect the dynamic nature of the game.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
