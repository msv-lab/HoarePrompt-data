Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                if cntl[j] == 0:
                    print(j)
                    break
                else:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c:
                        print(j)
                        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1 for each integer `i` present in `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` will contain the total count of occurrences of each integer `i` in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `cntl[0]` remains 0. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `n`, `c` is 2, and no break statements were executed during the loop's iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in `cntl` are equal to `k`, and `j` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cntl` is an array where the value at each index `i` from the list `a` is increased by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`, and `a` is an empty list since it has been fully processed. This holds true whether `cntl[0]` is 0 or not, as the else part indicates the loop has executed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
