Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `c` - 1.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`j`, `n`, and `cntl[j]`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 2 still holds, but since `cntl[j]` is only decremented if `j` is the index being considered, and no such decrement is explicitly shown, we keep the condition as `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 1.
