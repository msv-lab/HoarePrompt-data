Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and calculates the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It creates a count array `cntl` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - This is done using `cntl[i] += 1` for each element `i` in `a`.

3. **Determining the Initial MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0` immediately, indicating that `0` is the MEX.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`, meaning Alice can place at most 2 zeros in `c`.

4. **Calculating the MEX:**
   - It iterates through the elements from `1` to `n` and checks the count of each element.
   - If any element `j` appears less than 2 times, it updates `c` accordingly.
   - If `c` becomes `0`, it means the MEX is `j` and it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case 1: `0 0 1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `2`, `c` is set to `2`.
- The loop checks elements from `1` to `2` and finds no element with count less than `2`.
- Therefore, the output should be `2`.

#### Test Case 2: `0 1 2 3`
- `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `1`, `c` is set to `1`.
- The loop checks elements from `1` to `3` and finds no element with count less than `2`.
- Therefore, the output should be `1`.

#### Test Case 3: `1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `0`, it directly prints `0`.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the MEX is calculated accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
