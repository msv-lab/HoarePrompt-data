Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` is decreased by 1**

The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `c` is decreased by 1, but since the initial value of `c` is not specified, we only know that `c` has been decreased by 1. The precondition that `n` is at least 1 is not affected by the given code.
