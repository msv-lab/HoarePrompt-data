Output State: **`cntl` is an array where the value at index `i` is increased by 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increases the value at the index `i` in the `cntl` array by 1. The initial state of `a` being a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value in `cntl` at index `i` and retains the unchanged status of `a`.
