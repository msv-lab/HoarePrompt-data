Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, num_tests is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Since `num_tests` is another name for `n` in this context, `num_tests` is now an input integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range.
