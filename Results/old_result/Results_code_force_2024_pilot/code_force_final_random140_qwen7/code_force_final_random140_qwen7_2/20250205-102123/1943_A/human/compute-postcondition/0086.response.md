Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 1, but this value is not needed for the print statement.
- `c` is explicitly set to 0, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
