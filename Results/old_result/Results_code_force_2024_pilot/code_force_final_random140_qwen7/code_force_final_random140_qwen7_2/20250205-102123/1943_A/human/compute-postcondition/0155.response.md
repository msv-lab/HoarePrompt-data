Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly stated to be 2.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement.
- The conditions for `cntl[2]` and `c` are described, but these do not affect the execution of the print statement since it only prints the value of `j`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(j)` will simply output the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
