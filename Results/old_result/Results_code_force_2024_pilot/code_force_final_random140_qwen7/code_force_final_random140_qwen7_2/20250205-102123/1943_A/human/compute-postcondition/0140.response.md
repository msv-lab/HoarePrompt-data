Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is explicitly stated to be less than 2, and its current value is 0.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `j`.

Output: **1**
