Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once.

3. **Determine the Next State of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 2.

4. **Check the Loop Continuation Condition**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and the loop ran at least once, `n` must be at least 2 (since `j` started at 1).

5. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`. The value of `j` will change to 2, and `n` remains unchanged as no information suggests it should change.

6. **Postcondition Adjustment**: The postcondition for the loop to continue should reflect the new value of `j` and maintain the condition that `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once. Additionally, the postcondition should include the conditions related to `cntl[j]` and `c` as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and either `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0, or `cntl[j]` is not 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
