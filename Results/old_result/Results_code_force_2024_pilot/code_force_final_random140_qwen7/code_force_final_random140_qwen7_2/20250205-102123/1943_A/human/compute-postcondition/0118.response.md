Postcondition: **All elements in `cntl` are equal to `k`, and `j` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after the execution of the entire if-else block. Regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, the final state of `cntl` remains such that all its elements are equal to `k`, and `j` is 0. The else part does not change these conditions, confirming that they hold true after the entire if-else block executes.
