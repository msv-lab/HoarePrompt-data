Output State: **`j` is 3, `c` is 2, and `n` is at least 3**

Explanation: The value of `c` is decremented by 1, so if `c` was initially decreased by 1 from its previous state (which is not specified but implied to be at least 1 since `c` is being decremented), then `c` is now 2. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
