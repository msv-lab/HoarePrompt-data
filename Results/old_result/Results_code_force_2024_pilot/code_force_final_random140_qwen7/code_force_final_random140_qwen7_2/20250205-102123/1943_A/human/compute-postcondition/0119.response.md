Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means the loop will iterate based on the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - All elements in `cntl` are equal to `k`.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if the input provided by the user is greater than 0 (since `range(int(input()))` will generate a sequence from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`).
   - Since `j` starts at 0, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration of the loop. Therefore, after the first iteration, `j` will be 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The state of `j` needs to be adjusted to reflect its new value after the loop starts again.
   - The state of `cntl` remains unchanged because the problem does not specify any modification to `cntl` within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **All elements in `cntl` are equal to `k`, and `j` is 1**.
