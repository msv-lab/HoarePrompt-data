Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0, or `cntl[2]` is not 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
