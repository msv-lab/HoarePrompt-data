Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `cntl[i]` is 1

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will check the next value of `i` from the iterable `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next value in `a`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented to the next value in the iterable `a`.
   - The variable `cntl[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was 0 and it needs to be incremented to the next value in `a`, let's assume the next value of `i` in `a` is `x`. Therefore, `i` will be `x`.

Since `cntl[i]` is updated based on the value of `i`, the new state of `cntl[i]` will be `cntl[x]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`i` is the next value in `a`, `cntl[i]` is `cntl[next value of i]`**
