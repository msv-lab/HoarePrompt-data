Output State: **`cntl[i]` is the updated value from the previous iteration plus 1, `i` is the next value in `a`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The previous value of `cntl[i]` is referred to as the "updated value from the previous iteration." The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
