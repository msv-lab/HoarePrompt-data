Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and not equal to 0, `c` is `c` - 1.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is decremented by 1. Since `j` is initially 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and not equal to 0, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `c`.
