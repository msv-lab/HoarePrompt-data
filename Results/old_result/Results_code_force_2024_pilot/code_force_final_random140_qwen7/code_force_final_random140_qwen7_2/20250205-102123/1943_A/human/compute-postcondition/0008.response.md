Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `i` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.

2. **Understand the for loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed:**
   - The loop variable `i` is set to each element in the list `a` during each iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will take on the value of the next element in the list `a` for the next iteration.
   - Since `cntl[i]` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, it will be incremented again if `i` is the same as the current element in the list.

4. **Adjust the state:**
   - `a` remains a non-empty list of integers.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `cntl[i]` will be increased by 1 again in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `i` is the next element in the list `a` (which was the second element in the previous iteration).
- `cntl[i]` will be increased by 1 in this iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1**
