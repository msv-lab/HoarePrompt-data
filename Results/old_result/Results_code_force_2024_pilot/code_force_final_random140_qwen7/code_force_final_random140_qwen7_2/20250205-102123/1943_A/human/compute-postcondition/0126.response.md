Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cntl` is an array (or list) where the value at index `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the `cntl` list by 1. Since the initial state specified that `cntl` is an array (or list) where the value at index `i` is increased by 1, the increment operation does not change the fact that the value at index `i` is increased by 1. The list `a` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation.
