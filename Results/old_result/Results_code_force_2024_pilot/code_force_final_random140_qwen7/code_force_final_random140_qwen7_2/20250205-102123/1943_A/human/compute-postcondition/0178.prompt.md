Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cntl` is an array where the value at each index `i` from the list `a` is increased by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`, `a` is an empty list since it has been fully processed, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `c` is 2 if `cntl[0]` is less than or equal to 2, otherwise `c` is 2.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and either `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0, or `cntl[j]` is not 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being 0, or `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being -1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and either `cntl[2]` is less than 2 with `c` being -1 (after breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement) or `cntl[2]` is greater than or equal to 2 with `c` remaining unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
