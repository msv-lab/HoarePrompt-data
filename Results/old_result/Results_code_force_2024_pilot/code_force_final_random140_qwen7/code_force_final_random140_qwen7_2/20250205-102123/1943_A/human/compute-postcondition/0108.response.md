Output State: **`j` is either 1 or 2; `n` is greater than 0; `cntl[2]` is not 0; `c` is false**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Since `c` was initially true (which can be considered as 1 in boolean context), after decrementing by 1, it becomes false. The other variables (`j`, `n`, and `cntl[2]`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
