Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `i` is an element from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers, and the loop will iterate over each element in `a`, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will change with each iteration, but initially, we don't know its value. We only need to ensure that `a` is non-empty.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must be a non-empty list of integers**
