Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `cntl[j]` is explicitly given as 0, where `j` is 1. Therefore, `cntl[1]` is 0.
- The condition that the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2 is also satisfied since `cntl[1]` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(j)
```

This will simply print the value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
