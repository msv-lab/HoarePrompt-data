Output State: **`i` is 0; `cntl[i]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1, where `i` is 0. Since `cntl[0]` was initially unspecified but implied to exist (as `cntl` must contain at least one element), it is incremented from its initial value (which could be anything, but we consider it as 0 for simplicity) to 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
