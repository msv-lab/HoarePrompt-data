Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, and `cntl[i]` is now one more than its previous value.**

This means that the third element of the list `a` (which is `i`) had its corresponding value in `cntl` incremented by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
