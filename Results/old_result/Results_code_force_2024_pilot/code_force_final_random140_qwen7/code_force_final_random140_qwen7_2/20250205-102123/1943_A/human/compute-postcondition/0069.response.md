Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
   - `i` is set to the next value in `a`.
   - `cntl[next value of i]` is updated to the new value of `cntl[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since `i` is set to the next value in `a`, we need to identify what the next value of `i` is.
   - The updated value of `cntl[i]` (which is now `cntl[next value of i]`) needs to be reflected.

Given these points, let's construct the state for the next iteration:

- `i` will be the next value in `a` after the current value.
- `cntl[i]` (or equivalently `cntl[next value of i]`) will be the updated value from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State:**
- `i` is the next value in `a`.
- `cntl[i]` is the updated value from the previous iteration.

To express this precisely:

**State: **`i` is the next value in `a`, `cntl[i]` is the updated value from the previous iteration**.
