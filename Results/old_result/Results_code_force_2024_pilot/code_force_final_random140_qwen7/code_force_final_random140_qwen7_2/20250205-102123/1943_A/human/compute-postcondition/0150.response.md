Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer allowing the loop to run at least once, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0, `c` is 0 after the if-else block executes, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
