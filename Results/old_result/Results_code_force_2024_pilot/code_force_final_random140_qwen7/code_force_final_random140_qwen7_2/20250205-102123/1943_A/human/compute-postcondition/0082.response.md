Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `cntl[j]` is 0, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
