Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is 1 if either `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The current value of `count` is equal to `j`.

From the conditions given, since `j` is 0, it directly means that `count` is also 0 (as stated in the postcondition that the current value of `count` is equal to `j`).

The print statement is:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

Given that `count` is 0, `count * 2` will be `0 * 2`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
