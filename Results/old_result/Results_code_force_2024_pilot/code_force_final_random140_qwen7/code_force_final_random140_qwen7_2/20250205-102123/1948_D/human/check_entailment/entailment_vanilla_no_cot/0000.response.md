Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incomplete Function**: The function `func_1` is defined but not implemented properly. It does not handle the replacement of question marks with lowercase Latin letters before checking for tandem repeats.

2. **Count Logic**: The logic for counting consecutive matching characters is flawed. It should check if the current character and the corresponding character at the mirrored position are either both question marks or match each other. If they do, it should continue the count; otherwise, reset the count.

3. **Replacement Logic**: The program does not attempt to replace question marks with any characters to maximize the length of the tandem repeat. Instead, it directly checks the existing string for tandem repeats, which is insufficient.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns `0` when no tandem repeat is found, but it should also handle cases where no valid tandem repeat can be formed after replacing question marks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def max_tandem_repeat_length(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n // 2 + 1):
            left = s[i:i + j]
            right = s[i + j:i + 2 * j]
            if left == right:
                max_len = max(max_len, 2 * j)
    return max_len

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input().strip()
    # Replace '?' with all possible characters and find the maximum tandem repeat length
    max_length = 0
    for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        new_s = s.replace('?', char)
        max_length = max(max_length, max_tandem_repeat_length(new_s))
    print(max_length)
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible replacements of question marks and calculates the maximum length of a tandem repeat for each case.
