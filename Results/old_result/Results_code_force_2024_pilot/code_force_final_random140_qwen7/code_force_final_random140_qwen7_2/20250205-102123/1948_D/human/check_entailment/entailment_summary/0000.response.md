Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to find the longest tandem repeat substring by iterating through the string and checking for matching pairs.
2. However, there are a few issues with the logic:
   - The function `func_1()` is not correctly implemented to handle the replacement of `?` with any lowercase Latin letter.
   - The function does not attempt to replace `?` with different letters to maximize the length of the tandem repeat.
   - The function does not return 0 if it's impossible to form any tandem repeat, which is required by the problem statement.
3. The function should try replacing each `?` with every possible lowercase Latin letter and check if the resulting string has a longer tandem repeat.

Given these issues, the program does not fully address the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
