Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `(s[k] != '?' and s[k + j] != '?' and s[k] != s[k + j])`**

Explanation: The line `count = 0` sets the value of `count` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `j`, and the condition involving `s[k]`, `s[k + j]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
