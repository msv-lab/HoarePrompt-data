Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `k_prev + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
