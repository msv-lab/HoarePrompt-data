To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string.
   - `k` is an index within the string `s` that is 1 more than the previous value of `k`.
   - `j` is an integer.
   - `count` is determined based on the following conditions:
     - If `s[k]` is `'?'` or `s[k + j]` is `'?'` or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is equal to `j + 1`.
     - Otherwise, `count` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(count * 2)
   ```

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible scenarios for `count`:

- If any of the conditions (`s[k]` is `'?'`, `s[k + j]` is `'?'`, or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`) are true, then `count` will be `j + 1`.
- If none of these conditions are true, then `count` will be `0`.

Since the exact values of `s`, `k`, and `j` are not provided, we need to consider the general case where `count` could be either `j + 1` or `0`.

- If `count` is `j + 1`, then `count * 2` will be `2 * (j + 1)`.
- If `count` is `0`, then `count * 2` will be `0`.

Without specific values for `s`, `k`, and `j`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `count`. However, we know that `count` can only be `j + 1` or `0`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `count`:

Output: **2 * (j + 1) if count = j + 1, otherwise 0**
