You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    func_1()

def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    return 0



- Function Summary: 
The function iterates through a string `s` to find pairs of characters that are either identical or one of them is a question mark (`?`). If it finds a sequence where the number of matching pairs equals half the length of the remaining substring, it prints twice the length of this sequence and returns. If no such sequence is found, it returns 0. If the function does not meet any of the above conditions, it returns None.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the replacement of question marks (`?`) to form the longest possible tandem repeat.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Given the input string `code?????s`, the expected output should be `10` because we can replace the question marks to form the tandem repeat `codesssses`.

However, the current implementation does not attempt to replace the question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat. Instead, it checks if the current character and the character `j` positions ahead are either equal or one of them is a question mark, which is not sufficient to ensure the formation of the longest tandem repeat.

To fix this, the program needs to attempt different replacements for the question marks and check if they form a longer tandem repeat. This involves a more complex approach, such as trying all possible combinations of replacing question marks and then checking the resulting string for the longest tandem repeat.
