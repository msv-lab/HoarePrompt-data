Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is at least 2, `j` is initialized to `n // 2`, `k` is `k_prev + (n - j)`, and `count` is either increased by 1 in each iteration as long as the conditions `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` are met, or reset to 0 if `count` reaches `j`. If `count` equals `j` at any point during the loop, the loop prints `count * 2` and terminates.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` remains unchanged within its initial range, `n` remains at least 2, `j` stays as `n // 2`, `k` will have incremented by `n - j` from its initial value, and `count` will reflect the cumulative count of valid pairs found in the string `s` according to the given conditions. If `count` ever reaches `j`, it will print `2 * j` and the loop will terminate.
