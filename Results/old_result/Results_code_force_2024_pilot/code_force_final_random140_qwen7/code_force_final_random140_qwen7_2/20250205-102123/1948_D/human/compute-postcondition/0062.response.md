To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is explicitly stated to be 1.
   - `n` is the same as before, but its value is not provided.
   - `j` is the same as before, but its value is not provided.
   - `count` is increased by 1 if any of the following conditions are met:
     - `s[k]` is `'?'`
     - `s[k + j]` is `'?'`
     - `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(count * 2)
   ```

Given the conditions for increasing `count`, we need to consider the possible scenarios for `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`:

- If `s[k]` is `'?'`, `count` increases by 1.
- If `s[k + j]` is `'?'`, `count` increases by 1.
- If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, `count` increases by 1.

Since the exact values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not provided, we cannot definitively determine the exact value of `count`. However, we know that `count` is incremented under certain conditions.

The final expression to be printed is `count * 2`.

Output: **2 * count (where count is incremented based on the conditions described)**
