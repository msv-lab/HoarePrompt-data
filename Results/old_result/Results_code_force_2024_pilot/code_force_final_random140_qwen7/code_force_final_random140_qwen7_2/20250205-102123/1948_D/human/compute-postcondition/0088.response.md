Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is 2 if either `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is not equal to `j`.
- `k` is now `n - j`.

Given these conditions:
- Since `j` is 0, `k` becomes `n - 0` which simplifies to `n`.
- The value of `count` is explicitly stated to be 2 under certain conditions, and it is also mentioned that `count` is not equal to `j`. Since `j` is 0, `count` must be 2 (as 2 is not equal to 0).

Therefore, the value of `count` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

Substituting the value of `count`:
```python
print(2 * 2)
```

This will print:
```
4
```

Output: **4**
