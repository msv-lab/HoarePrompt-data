Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `j`: This is the loop variable that will be initialized and updated within the loop.
   - `n`: This is the upper limit for the loop, which is calculated as `n // 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j` in the range `n // 2` to `0`, the initial value of `j` should be `n // 2`.
   - The value of `n` itself must be greater than 0 for the loop to start, but since `n` is derived from `t`, we need to consider the relationship between `t` and `n`.

3. **Relationship Between `t` and `n`**:
   - The problem states that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
   - `n` is defined as `n = t // 2`.

4. **Initial Value of `n`**:
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 0. Given `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the smallest possible value of `t` is 1, which means the smallest possible value of `n` is `1 // 2 = 0.5`. Since `n` is an integer, the smallest possible value of `n` is 1 (when `t = 2`).
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 1.

5. **Initial Value of `j`**:
   - The loop starts with `j` set to `n // 2`. Since `n` is at least 1, `n // 2` is at least 0.5, and since `j` is an integer, the smallest possible value of `j` is 0 (when `n = 1`).

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` and `n` to ensure the loop can start.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `t` must be an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
- `n` must be at least 1, and `j` must be initialized to `n // 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `j` is initialized to `n // 2`**
