Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the replacement of question marks (`?`) to form the longest possible tandem repeat.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Given the input string `code?????s`, the expected output should be `10` because we can replace the question marks to form the tandem repeat `codesssses`.

However, the current implementation does not attempt to replace the question marks to form the longest possible tandem repeat. Instead, it checks if the current character and the character `j` positions ahead are either equal or one of them is a question mark, which is not sufficient to ensure the formation of the longest tandem repeat.

To fix this, the program needs to attempt different replacements for the question marks and check if they form a longer tandem repeat. This involves a more complex approach, such as trying all possible combinations of replacing question marks and then checking the resulting string for the longest tandem repeat.
