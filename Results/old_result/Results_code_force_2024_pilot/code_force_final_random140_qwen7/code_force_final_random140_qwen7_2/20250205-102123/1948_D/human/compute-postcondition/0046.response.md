To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the operations performed:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a string.
   - `k` is an index within the string `s`.
   - `j` is an integer.
   - `count` is increased by 1 under specific conditions:
     - If `s[k]` is equal to `'?'`.
     - If `s[k + j]` is equal to `'?'`.
     - If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - `count` is also explicitly set to `j`.

2. **Operations**:
   - The value of `count` is determined by the conditions mentioned above.
   - After determining `count`, it is assigned the value of `j`.

Given these conditions, the value of `count` will be `j` because the problem explicitly states that `count` is set to `j` regardless of the conditions being met or not.

Therefore, when the print statement `print(count * 2)` is executed, it will print twice the value of `j`.

Output: **2 * j**
