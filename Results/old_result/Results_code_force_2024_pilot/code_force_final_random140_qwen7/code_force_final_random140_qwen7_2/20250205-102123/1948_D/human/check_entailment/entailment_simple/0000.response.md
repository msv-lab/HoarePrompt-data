### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to replace each question mark (`?`) in the string `s` with a lowercase Latin letter to maximize the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s` and calls the function `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` iterates through possible lengths of tandem repeats starting from the largest possible length down to 1.

3. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - It checks for each possible tandem repeat length `j` from `n//2` down to 1.
   - For each length `j`, it uses a sliding window approach to check if the substring of length `j` can be extended to form a tandem repeat.
   - If it finds a valid tandem repeat, it prints the length and returns immediately.
   - If no valid tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, it returns 0.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where no valid tandem repeat is found by returning 0.
   - The function also correctly identifies valid tandem repeats by checking if the characters match or if one of them is a question mark.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement and examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter. The function `func_1()` correctly identifies valid tandem repeats and returns the appropriate output.

### Correctness:
**True**
