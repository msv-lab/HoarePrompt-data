Postcondition: `count` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `count` is not equal to `j`, and `k` is `n - 1`. This is because whether the condition `count == j` is true or false, the values of `count`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as per the given postconditions for both the if and else parts.
