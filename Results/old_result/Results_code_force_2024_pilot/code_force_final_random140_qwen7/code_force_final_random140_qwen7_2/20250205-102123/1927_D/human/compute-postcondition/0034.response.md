Output State: **`q` is a positive integer - 1; `l` is the result of R(); `r` is the result of R()**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()` and assigns its two return values to `l` and `r`. Since the initial state of `q` is a positive integer - 1, and no changes are made to `q` within the given code snippet, `q` remains unchanged. The values of `l` and `r` are the results of calling the function `R()`.
