Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in R()`. This means the loop iterates over elements generated by the function `R()`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is increased by `j`.
   - `x` is the next element in `R()`.
   - `p` is `x`.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand what needs to be adjusted for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if there is another element generated by `R()`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is updated to the next element from `R()`.
   - `p` should also be updated to the new value of `x`.
   - `i` will be increased by 1 again.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `x` is the next element from `R()`, it will be different from its previous value.
   - `p` will take the new value of `x`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`, `i` is increased by 1**. 

However, since `x` and `p` will change to the next element from `R()`, we can simplify the answer to focus on the key variables that change:

State: **`x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Since the initial values of `a` and `i` being increased by 1 are already implied by the loop structure, they don't need to be explicitly mentioned in the state for the next iteration.

Final Answer:
State: **`x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`, `i` is increased by 1**.
