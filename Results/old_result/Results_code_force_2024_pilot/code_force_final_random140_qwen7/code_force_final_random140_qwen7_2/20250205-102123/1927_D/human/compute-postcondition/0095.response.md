Output State: **`q` is the value returned by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x` for the last iteration, `a` is the sum of `j` for each iteration, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations which is the length of the sequence generated by `R()`, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]` for the last iteration.**

Explanation: The code `q, = R()` assigns the value returned by `R()` to `q`. The values of `p`, `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their previous states.
