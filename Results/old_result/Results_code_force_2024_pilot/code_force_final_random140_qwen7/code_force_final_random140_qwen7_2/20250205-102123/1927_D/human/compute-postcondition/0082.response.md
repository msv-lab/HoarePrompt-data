Output State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, `a` is increased by `j`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` to `p`. The value of `x` is a valid value returned by `R()`. The value of `j` remains unchanged, but it is now assigned to `p`. The value of `a` is increased by `j`, which means `a = a + j`.
