Output State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, `j` is equal to `(j, i)[x != p]`**

This means that the value of `j` is determined by the condition `x != p`. If `x` is not equal to `p`, then `j` takes the value of `i`; otherwise, `j` retains its original value of `j`. The initial value of `x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, and the values of `i` and `p` are unchanged from their initial states.
