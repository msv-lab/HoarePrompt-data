Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; t is the first element returned by the lambda function R applied to the input.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    R()
    a = [0]
    p = i = j = 0
    for x in R():
        j = (j, i)[x != p]
        a += j,
        p = x
        i += 1
    q, = R()
    while q:
        q -= 1
        l, r = R()
        print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `q` is `0`; `l` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration; `r` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration; `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration; `p` is the last value of `x` processed; `i` is the total number of iterations performed; `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration; `t` remains as the initial positive integer - 1; `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `q` will be reduced to `0` because it starts as a positive integer and is decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The values of `l` and `r` will be the results of the `R()` function calls made in the last iteration of the loop. The list `a` will contain integers that are either `j` or `i` based on the condition specified, with `i` being the number of iterations performed and `j` being the value of `i` from the last iteration. All other variables (`p`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `q` is less than or equal to 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().

After the loop executes all its iterations, `q` will eventually reach a value less than or equal to 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The values of `l` and `r` will be the most recent values returned by the function `R()` when the loop terminates.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `q` is 0, `l` is the return value of `R()` from the last iteration, `r` is the return value of `R()` from the last iteration, `a` is the sum of `j` for each iteration, `i` is the total number of iterations which is the length of the sequence generated by `R()`, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]` for the last iteration.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `q` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as a non-zero value and decreases by 1 in each iteration. The values of `l` and `r` will be the return values of `R()` from the last iteration where the loop condition was still true. The variable `a` will hold the sum of `j` for each iteration, `i` will be the total number of iterations (length of the sequence generated by `R()`), and `j` will be `(j, i)[x != p]` for the last iteration, as per the given conditions.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
