`t` is decremented by 1. The value of `t` was initially a positive integer minus 1, so now it is one less than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is 0; `l` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration; `r` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration; `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration; `p` is the last value of `x` processed; `i` is the total number of iterations performed; `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration; `t` is now `t - 1`; `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
