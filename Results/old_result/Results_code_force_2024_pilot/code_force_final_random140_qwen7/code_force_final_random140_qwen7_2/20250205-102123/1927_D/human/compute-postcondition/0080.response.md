Output State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.**

Explanation: The code assigns to `j` either `j` or `i` based on the condition `x != p`. Since `x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, its specific value is not known, but the condition `x != p` determines which value `j` will take. If `x` is not equal to `p`, then `j` will be assigned the value of `i`; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged with its previous value.
