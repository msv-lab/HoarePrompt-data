The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of integers and handles a series of queries. Each query consists of two indices `l` and `r`. The function then prints the value at index `r` in the array `a` if it is greater than or equal to `l`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function continues processing until all test cases and queries are handled.
