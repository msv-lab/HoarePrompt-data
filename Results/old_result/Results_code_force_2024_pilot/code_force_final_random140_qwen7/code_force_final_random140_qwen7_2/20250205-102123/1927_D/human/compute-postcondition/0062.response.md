Output State: **`q` is 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns the values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. The initial state of `q` remains unchanged. Therefore, `q` is still 0, and `l` and `r` take the values returned by `R()`.
