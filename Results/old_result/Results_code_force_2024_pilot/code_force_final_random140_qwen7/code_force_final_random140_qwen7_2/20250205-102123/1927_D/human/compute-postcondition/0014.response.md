Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether the next `x` is not equal to `p`, `p` is the next `x`, `i` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` increments `a` by the value of `j`. The value of `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether the next `x` is not equal to `p`. The variable `p` is set to the next `x`, and `i` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
