Output State: **`q` is less than or equal to 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R(); `t` is false**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `q` is less than or equal to 0, `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`, and `t` must be true. The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially true (which we can consider as 1 in boolean context), decrementing it by 1 results in `t` being false. The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
