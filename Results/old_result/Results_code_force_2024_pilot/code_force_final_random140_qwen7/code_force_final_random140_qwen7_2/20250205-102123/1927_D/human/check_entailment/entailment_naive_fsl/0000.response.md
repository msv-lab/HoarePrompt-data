Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the indices `i` and `j` returned for each query are within the specified range `[l, r]`. 

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```
- Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```
- Actual Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
2 3
```
The program returns `2 3` for the third query instead of `1 3`, which is within the range `[1, 3]`.

This indicates that the program is not correctly identifying the first valid pair of indices within the specified range for each query. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
