Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is 0, `l` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration, `r` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration, `a` is a list containing `[0]`, `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
Code of the loop:
for x in R():
    j = (j, i)[x != p]
    a += j,
    p = x
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is assigned the tuple `(j, i)` where the first element is `j` and the second element is `i` only if `x` is not equal to `p`; `a` is a tuple containing the tuple `(j, i)`, `p` is now equal to `x`, `i` is increased by 1, the values of `R()`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is increased by `j`, `x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`; variable `i` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`, `a` is `a + j`, `i` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
