Output State: **All executions of the loop have finished; `x` is a valid value returned by `R()` for each iteration; `p` is equal to `x` for the last iteration; `a` is the sum of `j` for each iteration; `i` is equal to the total number of iterations which is the length of the sequence generated by `R()`; `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]` for the last iteration.**

In this final state, the loop has executed as many times as there are elements in the sequence generated by `R()`. The variable `x` takes on each valid return value from `R()` in sequence. The variable `p` holds the value of `x` from the last iteration. The list `a` contains the cumulative sum of `j` values from each iteration. The variable `i` counts the total number of iterations, and `j` is set to `(j, i)` based on whether the current `x` is different from `p` for the last iteration.
