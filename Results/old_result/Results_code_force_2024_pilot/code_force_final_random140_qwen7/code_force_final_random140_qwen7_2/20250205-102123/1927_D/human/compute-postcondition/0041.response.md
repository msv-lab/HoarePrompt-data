Output State: **`q` is 0, `l` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration, `r` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration, `a` is a list containing `[0]`, `p` is the last value of `x` processed, `i` is the total number of iterations performed, `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `R()` is called.**

Explanation: The code `a = [0]` initializes the list `a` with a single element `0`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `p`, `i`, `j`, `t`, `n`, and the function call `R()` remain unchanged from their previous states.
