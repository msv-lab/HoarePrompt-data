Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is set to `q - 1`. This means `q` is decremented by 1.
   - `l` is the return value of `R()`. Since the function `R()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
   - `r` is the return value of `R()`. Similarly, since the function `R()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

   Let's analyze this line by line:
   - `a[r]` refers to the element in the list `a` at index `r`.
   - `a[r] < l` checks if the element at index `r` in the list `a` is less than `l`.
   - `[-1] * 2` creates a list with two `-1` elements.
   - `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` selects either the tuple `(a[r], r)` if `a[r] < l` is `True`, or the list `[-1, -1]` if `a[r] < l` is `False`.
   - `*` unpacks the selected tuple or list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

Given the lack of specific values for `a`, `l`, and `r`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Output:**
- If `a[r] < l` is `True`, then the output will be `a[r]` followed by `r`.
- If `a[r] < l` is `False`, then the output will be `-1` followed by `-1`.

Therefore, the output depends on the values of `a[r]` and `l`:
Output: **either [a[r]] [r] or [-1] [-1]**
