Output State: `q` is `0`; `l` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration; `r` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration; `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration; `p` is the last value of `x` processed; `i` is the total number of iterations performed; `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration; `t` remains as the initial positive integer - 1; `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `q` will be reduced to `0` because it starts as a positive integer and is decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The values of `l` and `r` will be the results of the `R()` function calls made in the last iteration of the loop. The list `a` will contain integers that are either `j` or `i` based on the condition specified, with `i` being the number of iterations performed and `j` being the value of `i` from the last iteration. All other variables (`p`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
