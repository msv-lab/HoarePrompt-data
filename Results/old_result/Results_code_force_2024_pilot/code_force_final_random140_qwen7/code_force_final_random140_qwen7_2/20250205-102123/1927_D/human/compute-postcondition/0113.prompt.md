You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. Each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        R()
        
        a = [0]
        
        p = i = j = 0
        
        for x in R():
            j = (j, i)[x != p]
            a += j,
            p = x
            i += 1
        
        q, = R()
        
        while q:
            q -= 1
            l, r = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
        
    #State: Output State: `q` is 0; `l` is the return value of `R()` from the last iteration; `r` is the return value of `R()` from the last iteration; `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration; `i` is the total number of iterations performed; `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration; `t` is 0 (since it is decremented until it reaches 0); `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as a positive integer and is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `q` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `l` and `r` will be the return values of `R()` from the last iteration where the loop condition was still true. The list `a` will contain integers that are either `j` or `i` based on the condition specified, with `i` being the number of iterations performed and `j` being the value of `i` from the last iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (a positive integer), n (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive), a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive), and q (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive). For each query represented by two integers l and r (where 1 <= l < r <= n), the function processes these queries and returns results based on the specified conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
