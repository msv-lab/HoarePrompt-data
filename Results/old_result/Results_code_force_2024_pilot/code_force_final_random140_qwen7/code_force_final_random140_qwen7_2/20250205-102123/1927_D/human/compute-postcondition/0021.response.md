Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether the next `x` is not equal to `p`, `p` is now equal to `x`, `i` is increased by 1, and `x` is the new value of `x`.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain in their previous states relative to the conditions given.
