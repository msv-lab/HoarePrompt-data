Output State: **`q` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()` which returns two values. These values are assigned to `l` and `r`. The initial state of `q` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `q`. Therefore, `q` is still a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1.
