Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1. This means `q` is a positive integer.
   - `l` is the return value of `R()`. Since `R()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
   - `r` is the return value of `R()`. Again, since `R()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)` creates a tuple with two elements:
     - The first element is a tuple `(a[r], r)`.
     - The second element is a list `[-1] * 2` which is `[-1, -1]`.
   - The expression `[a[r] < l]` is a conditional expression that evaluates to either the first tuple `(a[r], r)` if `a[r] < l` is `True`, or the list `[-1, -1]` if `a[r] < l` is `False`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the selected tuple or list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, then the print statement will output the elements of the tuple `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, then the print statement will output the list `[-1, -1]`.

Since `a[r]` and `l` are not explicitly defined, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l else [-1, -1]**
