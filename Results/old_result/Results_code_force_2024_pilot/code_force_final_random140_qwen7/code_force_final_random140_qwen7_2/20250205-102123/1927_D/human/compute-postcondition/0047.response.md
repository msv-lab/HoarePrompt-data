Output State: **`j` is assigned the tuple `(j, i)` where the first element is `j` and the second element is `i` only if `x` is not equal to `p`; `a` is a tuple containing the tuple `(j, i)`, `p` is now equal to `x`, `i` is increased by 1, the values of `R()`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions and values of other variables remain as per the initial state.
