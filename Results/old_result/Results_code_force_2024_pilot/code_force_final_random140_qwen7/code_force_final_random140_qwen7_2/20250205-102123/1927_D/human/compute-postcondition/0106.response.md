Output State: **`q` is `q - 1`, `l` is the return value of `R()`, `r` is the return value of `R()`**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns the return values of the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. The value of `q` is decremented by 1, and the values of `l` and `r` are updated to the return values of the function `R()`. The initial state of `l` being the return value of `R()` and `r` being the return value of `R()` remains unchanged except for their assignment within the current scope.
