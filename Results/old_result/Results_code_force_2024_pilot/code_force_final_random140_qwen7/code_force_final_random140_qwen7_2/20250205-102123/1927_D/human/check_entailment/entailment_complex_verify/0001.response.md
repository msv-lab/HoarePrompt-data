### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step by step.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())`: Defines a function `R` to read multiple integers from a single line.
   - `(t,) = R()`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - The loop `while t:` processes each test case.
     - `t -= 1`: Decrements the number of remaining test cases.
     - `R()`: Reads the size of the array `n`.
     - `a = [0]`: Initializes an array `a` with a dummy value `0`.
     - `p = i = j = 0`: Initializes variables `p`, `i`, and `j` to `0`.
     - `for x in R()`: Reads the array elements.
       - `j = (j, i)[x != p]`: Updates `j` to `i` if the current element `x` is different from `p`.
       - `a += (j,)`: Appends the current value of `j` to the array `a`.
       - `p = x`: Updates `p` to the current element `x`.
       - `i += 1`: Increments the index `i`.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - `(q,) = R()`: Reads the number of queries.
   - The loop `while q:` processes each query.
     - `q -= 1`: Decrements the number of remaining queries.
     - `(l, r) = R()`: Reads the query bounds `l` and `r`.
     - `print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])`: Prints the result.
       - `a[r] < l`: Checks if the element at index `r` is less than `l`.
         - If true, it prints `[-1, -1]`.
         - Otherwise, it prints `(a[r], r)`.

#### Correctness Analysis

1. **Array Construction:**
   - The array `a` is constructed such that `a[i]` stores the last index where the value `a[i]` appeared before index `i`. This is done using the variable `j` which is updated whenever a new value is encountered.
   - For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`:
     - `a[1] = 0` (initial value)
     - `a[2] = 1` (last occurrence of 1 before index 2)
     - `a[3] = 2` (last occurrence of 2 before index 3)
     - `a[4] = 3` (last occurrence of 1 before index 4)
     - `a[5] = 3` (last occurrence of 1 before index 5)

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the element at index `r` is within the range `[l, r]`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, it means no distinct elements exist in the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `[-1, -1]`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the index `r` and the element `a[r]`.

#### Example Walkthrough

Consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Array: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
  - Queries: 
    - Query 1: `1 5` → `a[5] = 1` (not in range `[1, 5]`) → Output: `-1 -1`
    - Query 2: `1 2` → `a[2] = 1` (in range `[1, 2]`) → Output: `2 3`
    - Query 3: `1 3` → `a[3] = 2` (in range `[1, 3]`) → Output: `1 3`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Array: `[30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]`
  - Queries: 
    - Query 1: `1 2` → `a[2] = 1` (in range `[1, 2]`) → Output: `2 1`
    - Query 2: `2 3` → `a[3] = 2` (in range `[2, 3]`) → Output: `2 3`
    - Query 3: `2 4` → `a[4] = 3` (in range `[2, 4]`) → Output: `4 2`
    - Query 4: `2 6` → `a[6] = 4` (in range `[2, 6]`) → Output: `4 6`
    - Query 5: `3 5` → `a[5] = 5` (in range `[3, 5]`) → Output: `5 3`

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs the array `a` and processes each query to find a pair of different elements within the specified range or reports that no such pair exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
