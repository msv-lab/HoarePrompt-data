The loop condition is `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be non-zero (i.e., `q > 0`). At the end of the previous iteration, `q` has been decremented by 1 (`q = q - 1`). Therefore, to ensure that `q` is non-zero for the next iteration, `q` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the return value of `R()`, `r` is the return value of `R()`**
