Output State: **`q` is 0, `l` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration, `r` is the result of `R()` from the last iteration, `a` is a list containing `[0]`, `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**.

Explanation: The code sets `p`, `i`, and `j` all to 0. The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `a`, `p`, `i`, `j`, `t`, and `n` are updated accordingly. `q` and `l` retain their previous values since they are not re-assigned. `a` remains unchanged as it only contains one element, which is 0. `p`, `i`, and `j` are explicitly set to 0. `t` is decremented by 1. `n` remains within its initial range as no operation changes its value.
