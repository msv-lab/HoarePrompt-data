Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \([1, 10^6]\), and `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**.

Explanation: The function `R()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `R()` is provided, no changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `q`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
