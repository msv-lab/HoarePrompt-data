Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the array `a` is now `[0]`, `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**.

This means that the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` retain their initial conditions, while `p`, `i`, and `j` are initialized to 0.
