Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`; `p` is now equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. The values of `a` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `j` still being either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`. After executing the code, `p` now holds the value of `x`.
