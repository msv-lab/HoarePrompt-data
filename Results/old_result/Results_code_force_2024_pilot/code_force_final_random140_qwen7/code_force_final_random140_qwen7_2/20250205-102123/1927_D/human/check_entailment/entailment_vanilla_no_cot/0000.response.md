Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Different Elements:**
   - The logic in the `a` list construction is flawed. It does not ensure that `a[r]` will be a valid index for the range `[l, r]`.
   - The variable `j` is used to track the last seen index where the element was different from `p`, but this does not guarantee that `a[r]` will be within the range `[l, r]`.

2. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the queries. It prints `a[r]` directly without checking if it falls within the range `[l, r]`. This can lead to incorrect results or out-of-bound errors.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program should output pairs of indices `i` and `j` for each query, but it currently outputs either a valid pair or `-1 -1` without ensuring that the indices are within the specified range.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should use a set to track unique elements in the current window defined by the query. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    from collections import defaultdict

    R = lambda : map(int, input().split)
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = next(R())
        a = list(R())
        q = next(R())
        queries = [tuple(R()) for _ in range(q)]

        for l, r in queries:
            unique_elements = set(a[l-1:r])
            if len(unique_elements) > 1:
                for i in range(l-1, r):
                    for j in range(i+1, r):
                        if a[i] != a[j]:
                            print(i+1, j+1)
                            break
                    else:
                        continue
                    break
                else:
                    print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(-1, -1)

func()
```

This approach ensures that for each query, it checks the subarray `[l, r]` and finds a pair of indices with different elements or reports that no such pair exists.
