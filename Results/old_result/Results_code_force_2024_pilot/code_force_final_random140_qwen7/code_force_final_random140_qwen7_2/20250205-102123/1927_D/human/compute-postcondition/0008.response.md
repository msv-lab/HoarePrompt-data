Output State: **`j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.**

Explanation: The line `j = (j, i)[x != p]` uses a tuple selection based on the condition `x != p`. If `x` is not equal to `p`, then `j` will take the value of `j`; otherwise, `j` will take the value of `i`. The initial values of `x` and `p` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `j` without knowing these values. However, we know that `j` will be either `j` or `i` based on the condition. All other variables remain unchanged.
