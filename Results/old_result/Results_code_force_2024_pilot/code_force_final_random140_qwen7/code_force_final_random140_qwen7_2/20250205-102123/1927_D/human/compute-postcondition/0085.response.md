Output State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, `a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`**

Explanation: The code assigns `j` the value of either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`. Since `x` is equal to `p`, the condition `x != p` evaluates to `False`. In Python, when the second element of a tuple is selected under a condition that evaluates to `False`, it returns the first element of the tuple. Therefore, `j` remains unchanged and is still equal to its original value `j`. All other variables retain their previous values.
