Output State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, `j` is equal to `(j, i)[x != p]`, `a` is `a` plus `j`, `p` is now equal to `x`, `i` is increased by 1.**

This means that `i` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `x`, `j`, `a`, and `p` remain as they were before the increment, with `j` being defined based on the condition `x != p`.
