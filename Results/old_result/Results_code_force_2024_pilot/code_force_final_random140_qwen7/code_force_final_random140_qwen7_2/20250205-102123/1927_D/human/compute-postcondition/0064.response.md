The loop condition is `q`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `q` is truthy (non-zero). At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be non-zero.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `q` is non-zero.

State: **`q` must be non-zero, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R()**
