Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. This means if the original value of `q` was `n`, then `q = n - 1`.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`. Since the function `R()` is not specified, we'll denote it as `l = R()`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`. Again, since the function `R()` is not specified, we'll denote it as `r = R()`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution:**
   - First, we need to understand the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]`.
   - `a[r]` refers to the element in the list `a` at index `r`. However, the list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We can only infer that `a` is a list with at least two elements because `[-1] * 2` implies a list of length 2.
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)` creates a tuple with two elements: `(a[r], r)` and `[-1] * 2`.
   - The condition `a[r] < l` determines which of the two elements in the tuple will be selected.
     - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `(a[r], r)`.
     - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `[-1] * 2`.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the tuple or list into separate arguments for the `print` function.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the `print` function will print the elements of the tuple `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the `print` function will print the elements of the list `[-1] * 2`, which is `[-1, -1]`.

Given the lack of specific values for `a`, `l`, and `r`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise [-1, -1]**
