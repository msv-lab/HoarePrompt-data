Output State: **`x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `j` to either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`. Since `x` is the next element in `R()` and `p` is `x`, the condition `x != p` is always false. Therefore, `j` is assigned the value of `j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
