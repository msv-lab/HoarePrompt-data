Output State: **`x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`, `a` is `a + j`**

Explanation: The code `p = x` updates the value of `p` to be the current value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `p` being set to the current value of `x`, while `x`, `i`, `j`, and `a` retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
