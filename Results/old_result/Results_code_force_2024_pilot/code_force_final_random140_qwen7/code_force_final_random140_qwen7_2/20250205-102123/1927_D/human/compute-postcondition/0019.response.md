Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether the next `x` is not equal to `p`, `p` is now equal to `x`, `i` is increased by 1, and `x` is the new value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` increments `a` by the value of `j`. The value of `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether the next `x` is not equal to `p`. After this operation, `p` is updated to the current value of `x`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is updated to its new value. All these changes are reflected in the output state.
