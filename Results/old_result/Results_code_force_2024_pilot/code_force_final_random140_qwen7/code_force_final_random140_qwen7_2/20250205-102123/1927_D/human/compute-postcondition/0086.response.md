Output State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, `a` is increased by `2*j`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`**

Explanation: The initial state is given as follows:
- `x` is a valid value returned by `R()`
- `p` is equal to `x`
- `a` is increased by `j`
- `i` is increased by 1
- `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`

The code snippet `a += j` increments `a` by `j`. Since `a` was already increased by `j` before, now `a` is increased by another `j`, making it increased by `2*j` in total.

The value of `j` remains unchanged unless `x != p`, which would make `j` equal to `i`. However, since `x` is equal to `p`, `j` does not change.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `x` is a valid value returned by `R()`
- `p` is equal to `x`
- `a` is increased by `2*j`
- `i` is increased by 1
- `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`, which simplifies to `j` since `x == p`
