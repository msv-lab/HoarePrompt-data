The loop condition is `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be non-zero (i.e., `q > 0`). 

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is set to `q - 1`. This means that `q` was non-zero before the subtraction, but now it is reduced by 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, `q` must be greater than 0.

No other states (`l` and `r`) need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
