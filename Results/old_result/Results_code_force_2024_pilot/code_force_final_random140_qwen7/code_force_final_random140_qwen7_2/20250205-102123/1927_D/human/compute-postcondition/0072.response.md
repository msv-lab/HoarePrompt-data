Output State: `q` is less than or equal to 0; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().

After the loop has executed all its iterations, `q` will eventually become less than or equal to 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The values of `l` and `r` will be the results of the last call to the function `R()` made within the loop.
