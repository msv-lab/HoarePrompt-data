Reasoning:
1. The provided solution reads the input and processes each test case one by one.
2. For each test case, it constructs a list `a` where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that the current element `x` is not equal to `p`.
3. The variable `p` keeps track of the previous element, and `j` is updated to `i` only when the current element `x` is different from `p`.
4. When processing queries, the solution prints the result based on whether the element at index `r` is within the range `[l, r]`. If it is, it prints the element at index `r` and `r` itself; otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.
5. The logic seems to correctly identify pairs of different elements within the queried range or report that no such pair exists.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
- The construction of the list `a` is not necessary and complicates the solution. It can be simplified by directly checking for different elements within the queried range.
- The logic for handling queries could be more straightforward without constructing the list `a`.

Given these points, let's re-evaluate the correctness of the provided solution:
- The solution constructs a list `a` which is not used in the final query processing, making the code unnecessarily complex.
- The query processing logic is flawed because it uses the constructed list `a` instead of directly checking the elements within the range `[l, r]`.

A simpler and more direct approach would be to directly check for different elements within the range `[l, r]` for each query.

Therefore, the provided solution is not entirely correct due to unnecessary complexity and flawed logic in handling queries.

Correctness: **False**
