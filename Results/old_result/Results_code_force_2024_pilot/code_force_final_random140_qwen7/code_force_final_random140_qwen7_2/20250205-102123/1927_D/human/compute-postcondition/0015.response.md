Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether the next `x` is not equal to `p`, `p` is now equal to `x`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `j`, or `i` directly, but it updates `p` to the current value of `x`. The conditions for `j` remain unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1 as per the initial state.
