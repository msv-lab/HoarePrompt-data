Output State: **`x` is the next element in `R()`, `p` is `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`, `a` is `a + j`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables (`x`, `p`, `j`, `a`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `i`.
