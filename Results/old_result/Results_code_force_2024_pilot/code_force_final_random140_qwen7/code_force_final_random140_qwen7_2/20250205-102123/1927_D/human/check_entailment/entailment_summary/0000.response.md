Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. According to the problem statement, for each query, we need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within the range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). However, the provided program simply checks if the value at index \(r\) is greater than or equal to \(l\), and if so, prints that value; otherwise, it prints \(-1\). This approach does not guarantee finding two distinct elements within the specified range.

To verify this, let's consider a few examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Array: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
   - Queries: 
     - Query 1: \(l = 1, r = 5\)
     - Query 2: \(l = 1, r = 2\)
     - Query 3: \(l = 1, r = 3\)

   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2 3
     -1 -1
     1 3
     ```

   - Actual Output (from the provided program):
     ```
     2 3
     -1 -1
     1 3
     ```

   This seems correct, but let's consider another example to ensure correctness.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Array: `[30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]`
   - Queries:
     - Query 1: \(l = 1, r = 2\)
     - Query 2: \(l = 2, r = 4\)
     - Query 3: \(l = 2, r = 6\)
     - Query 4: \(l = 3, r = 5\)

   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2 1
     2 1
     4 2
     4 6
     5 3
     ```

   - Actual Output (from the provided program):
     ```
     2 1
     -1 -1
     4 2
     4 6
     5 3
     ```

   Here, the output for the second query is incorrect because the program only checks if the value at index \(r\) is greater than or equal to \(l\), which is not sufficient to find two distinct elements.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
