Output State: **`j` is assigned the tuple `(j, i)` where the first element is `j` and the second element is `i`, but only if `x` is not equal to `p`; `a` is a tuple containing the tuple `(j, i)`, `p` is now equal to `x`, the values of `R()`, `i`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. All other variables (`j`, `i`, `a`, `R()`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
