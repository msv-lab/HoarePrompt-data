Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`; `p` is now equal to `x`; variable `i` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `a`, `j`, `p`, and the condition for `j` remain as they were initially.
