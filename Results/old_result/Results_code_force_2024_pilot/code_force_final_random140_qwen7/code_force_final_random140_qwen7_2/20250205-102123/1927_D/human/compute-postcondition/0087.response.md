Output State: **`x` is a valid value returned by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`, `a` is increased by `2*j`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`, and `p` is now equal to `x`**.

Explanation: The line `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` (which is a valid value returned by `R()`) to `p`. This does not change the value of `x` itself, nor does it affect the values of `a`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the updated state includes `p` being equal to `x`.
