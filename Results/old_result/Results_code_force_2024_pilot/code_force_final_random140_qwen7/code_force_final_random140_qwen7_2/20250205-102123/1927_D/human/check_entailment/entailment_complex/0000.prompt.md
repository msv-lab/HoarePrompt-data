Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. Each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        R()
        
        a = [0]
        
        p = i = j = 0
        
        for x in R():
            j = (j, i)[x != p]
            a += j,
            p = x
            i += 1
        
        q, = R()
        
        while q:
            q -= 1
            l, r = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
        
    #State: Output State: `q` is 0; `l` is the return value of `R()` from the last iteration; `r` is the return value of `R()` from the last iteration; `a` is a list of integers where each element is either `j` or `i` based on the condition that `x` is not equal to `p` during each iteration; `i` is the total number of iterations performed; `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration; `t` is 0 (since it is decremented until it reaches 0); `n` remains as the initial integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as a positive integer and is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `q` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `l` and `r` will be the return values of `R()` from the last iteration where the loop condition was still true. The list `a` will contain integers that are either `j` or `i` based on the condition specified, with `i` being the number of iterations performed and `j` being the value of `i` from the last iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of integers and handles a series of queries. Each query consists of two indices `l` and `r`. The function then prints the value at index `r` in the array `a` if it is greater than or equal to `l`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function continues processing until all test cases and queries are handled.
