Output State: **`q` is `q - 1`, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R()**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns the values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since `R()` returns a value, `l` and `r` are assigned those values respectively. The value of `q` is decremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified, so it remains as `q - 1`. The initial values of `l` and `r` are now updated to the values returned by `R()`.
