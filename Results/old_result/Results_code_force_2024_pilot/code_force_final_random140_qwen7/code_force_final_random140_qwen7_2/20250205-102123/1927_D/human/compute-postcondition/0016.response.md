Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether the next `x` is not equal to `p`, `p` is now equal to `x`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`a`, `j`, `p`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
