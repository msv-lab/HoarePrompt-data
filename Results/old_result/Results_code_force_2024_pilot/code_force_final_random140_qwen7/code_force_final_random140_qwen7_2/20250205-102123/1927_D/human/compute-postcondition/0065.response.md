Output State: **`q` is `q - 1`, `l` is a value returned by R(), `r` is a value returned by R()**

Explanation: The value of `q` is decremented by 1, making it `q - 1`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged as they are the results of calling the function `R()` and are not affected by the operation on `q`.
