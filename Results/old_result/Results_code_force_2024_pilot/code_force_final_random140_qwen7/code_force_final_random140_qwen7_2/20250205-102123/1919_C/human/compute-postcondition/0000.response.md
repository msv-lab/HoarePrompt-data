Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the underscore `_`, which is used as a throwaway variable to iterate over the range of input values.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: Since the loop is iterating based on user input, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself. The loop will execute as long as the input value is a non-negative integer.

3. **Consider the constraints**: The problem states that `t` (the input value) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the loop will execute up to 10,000 times.

4. **Formulate the state**: For the loop to execute, the input value `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
