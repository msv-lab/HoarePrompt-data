Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 1, and `a` is a list of integers. If the last element of `a` was less than the element at index `i-1` of `lit` (when `i` is 2), then the last element of `a` is now equal to the element at index `i-1` of `lit`, and `a` has an additional element which is the same as the element at index `i-1` of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is now greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` of `lit` (when `i` is 1), then the last element of `a` remains unchanged, and `a` has an additional element which is the same as the element at index `i-1` of `lit`.
