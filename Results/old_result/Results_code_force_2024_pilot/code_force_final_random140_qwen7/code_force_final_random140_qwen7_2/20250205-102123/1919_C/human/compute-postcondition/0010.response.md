Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the last element of `a` is now greater than or equal to `lit[i]`; `a` has an additional element which is `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 1 initially, `a.append(lit[1])` adds `lit[1]` to the end of the list `a`. The conditions for `n` and the last element of `a` being greater than or equal to `lit[i]` remain unchanged.
