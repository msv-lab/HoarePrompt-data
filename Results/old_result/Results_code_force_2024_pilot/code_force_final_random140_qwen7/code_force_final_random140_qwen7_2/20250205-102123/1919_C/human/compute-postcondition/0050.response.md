Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `len(b)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(b))`. This means `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `s` is 2 (though `s` is not part of the loop head, it doesn't affect the loop continuation)
   - `len(b)` is at least 3
   - The postcondition regarding `b[2] > b[1]` does not affect the loop continuation directly.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (since the loop starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time).
   - `len(b)` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `s` is 2, `len(b)` is at least 3**
