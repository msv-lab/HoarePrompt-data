Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a` if they were added during the loop's iterations, and `s` is 0.**

This output state indicates that the variable `s` has been initialized to 0, while the other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) retain their previously described states after the loop's execution.
