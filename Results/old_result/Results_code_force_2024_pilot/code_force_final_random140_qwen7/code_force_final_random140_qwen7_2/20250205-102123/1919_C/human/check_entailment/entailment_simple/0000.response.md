Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to split the given array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) such that the total penalty (number of indices where elements are strictly increasing) is minimized. The given solution attempts to achieve this by splitting the array into two parts: one part (`a`) that maintains the increasing order of elements and another part (`b`) that contains the remaining elements.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes two lists, `a` and `b`, where `a` starts with the first element of the array and `b` is initially empty.
   - It iterates through the rest of the array and appends elements to `a` if they are greater than the last element in `a`, otherwise, it appends them to `b`.
   - It calculates the penalty for both `a` and `b` by counting the number of increasing pairs within each list.
   - Finally, it prints the total penalty, which is the sum of penalties for `a` and `b`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the array are in increasing order, `a` will contain all elements, and `b` will be empty. The penalty will be the number of increasing pairs in `a`.
   - If all elements are in decreasing order, `b` will contain all elements, and `a` will be empty. The penalty will be 0.
   - If there are mixed elements, the code correctly splits them into `a` and `b` to minimize the penalty.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the code. For instance, in the first example, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is split into `[2, 4, 5]` and `[1, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of 3.
   - In the second example, the array `[8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]` is split into `[8, 3, 1]` and `[2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of 1.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences and calculating the penalty accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
