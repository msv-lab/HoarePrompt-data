Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` contains the element from list `l` at index 3**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element from the list `lit` at index `i` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, `a` will contain the element from `lit` at index 3. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid, though `n` itself is not directly affected by this line of code.
