Output State: **`i` is 1; `a` must contain at least one element; the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]`; `s` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Since `s` was initially 0 (implied from the precondition that `i` is 1 and the other conditions), it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
