Output State: **`i` is 1; `s` is 1; `len(b)` is at least 2, and the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the previous value `b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0 (implied by the initial state where `i` is 1, which suggests no prior value for `s`). The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
