Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts at 1 (since the loop is defined as `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be set to 1 initially.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Other variables in the state**:
   - `a`: It is initialized as a list containing the first element of `lit`.
   - `b`: It is an empty list.
   - `s`: It is the total count of elements in list `b` where an element is greater than its preceding element. Since `b` is empty, `s` remains 0.
   - `lit`: It is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.
   - `cp`: It is 0 and does not affect the loop execution directly.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
