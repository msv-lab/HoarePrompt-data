Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by any elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their preceding element.**

In more detail:
- The variable `i` will be set to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- The list `a` will start with the first element of `lit` and will append any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element.
- The list `b` will collect all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their preceding element.
