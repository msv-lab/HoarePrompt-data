Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is initially 1, the last element of `a` after appending will be `lit[1]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
