Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `1, n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - The postcondition states that if `a[-1]` is less than `lit[2]`, then `a` contains the element `lit[2]`. Otherwise, `a` contains the element `lit[2]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `1, n`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, it will increment to 3 in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Update the postcondition**:
   - The postcondition needs to be updated based on the new value of `i` (which will be 3) and the condition for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

Since there are no other variables mentioned in the loop head, we don't need to adjust any additional states.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
