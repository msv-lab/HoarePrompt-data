Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(a)`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches the length of the list `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` must contain at least one element
   - `s` is 1 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head)
   - If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, the condition holds as is; otherwise, the condition does not change.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(a)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than the length of `a`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` needs to be checked for `i = 2`. However, since the problem does not specify the exact values of `a`, we cannot determine if this condition holds or not based on the given information. We only need to ensure that `i` is set correctly for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `a` must contain at least one element, `s` is 1**.
