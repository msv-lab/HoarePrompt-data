Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `a` has an additional element `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, the value of `lit[k + 1]` is appended to `a`. The initial conditions that `n` must be greater than 1 and the value of `i` being `k + 1` are still valid after the code execution.
