Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the total count of elements in list `b` where an element is greater than its preceding element, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index 1 in the list `lit`, then `b` contains the element at index 1 from the list `lit`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2. If `a[-1]` is less than `lit[2]`, then `a` contains the element `lit[2]`. Otherwise, `a` contains the element `lit[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If the last element of list `a` is less than `lit[3]`, then the last element of `a` is updated to `lit[3]`. Otherwise, `a` contains the element from list `l` at index 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
