Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because `range(1, n)` generates numbers from `1` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either `2` or `3`.
   - The postcondition states that if the last element of list `a` is less than the element from list `lit` at index `i`, then `b` contains the element from list `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, `a` contains the element from list `lit` at index `i`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, if `i` was `2` in the previous iteration, it will be `3` in the next iteration.
   - If `i` was `3` in the previous iteration, the loop would terminate because `i` would reach `n` (which is `4` in this case).

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was `2` in the previous iteration, it will be `3` in the next iteration.
   - If `i` was `3` in the previous iteration, the loop will terminate.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- If `i` was `2` in the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `3`.
- If `i` was `3` in the previous iteration, the loop will terminate, but since we are asked to consider the state just before termination, we assume the loop continues and `i` becomes `3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (or the final iteration if `i` was `3`) should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
