Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences. The issue lies in how the subsequences `a` and `b` are formed. Specifically, the program always appends elements to `a` if they are greater than the last element of `a`, and to `b` otherwise. This approach does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
2 1 3 4
```

The program's output would be:
```
2
```

However, the correct minimum penalty can be achieved by splitting the array as follows:
- Subsequence `s = [2, 3]` and `t = [1, 4]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `p(s) = 1` (since `2 < 3`).
- The penalty for `t` is `p(t) = 1` (since `1 < 4`).
- Therefore, the total penalty is `1 + 1 = 2`.

But consider another optimal split:
- Subsequence `s = [2, 4]` and `t = [1, 3]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `p(s) = 1` (since `2 < 4`).
- The penalty for `t` is `p(t) = 1` (since `1 < 3`).
- Therefore, the total penalty is `1 + 1 = 2`.

This split achieves the same minimum penalty, but the program's logic does not guarantee this optimal split. Hence, the program is incorrect.
