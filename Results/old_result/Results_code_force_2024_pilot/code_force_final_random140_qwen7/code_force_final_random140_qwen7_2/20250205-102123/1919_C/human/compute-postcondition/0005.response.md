Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`.
   - The variable `i` is being initialized to 1 and incremented within the loop.
   - The variable `n` defines the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (as per the range function).
   - `n` is an input integer provided as part of the program state.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will run as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` is set to 1 initially.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
