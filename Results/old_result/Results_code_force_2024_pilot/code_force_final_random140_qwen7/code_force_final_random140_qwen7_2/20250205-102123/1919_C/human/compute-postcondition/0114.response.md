Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b)`, `s` is the total count of elements in list `b` where an element is greater than its preceding element, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `lit`. The values of `i`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
