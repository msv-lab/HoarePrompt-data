Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [lit[0]], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[-1] < lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        else:
            a.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `s` is `n-1`, `len(b)` is `n`, and `b` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `len(b)`, and `s` will be the total count of elements in list `b` where an element is greater than its preceding element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by any elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their preceding element; `s` will be the total count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
