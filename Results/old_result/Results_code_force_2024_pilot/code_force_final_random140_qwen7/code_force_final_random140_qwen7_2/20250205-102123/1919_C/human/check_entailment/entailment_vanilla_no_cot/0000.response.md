Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. The program attempts to split the array into two subsequences `a` and `b` such that `a` is strictly increasing and then counts the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences. However, this approach does not necessarily yield the minimum possible penalty because it does not consider all possible ways to split the array into two subsequences.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a different approach. One effective method is to sort the array and then count the number of inversions in the sorted array. The number of inversions gives us the minimum possible penalty because any optimal split will essentially follow the sorted order to minimize the number of increasing subsequences.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index]); index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index]); index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index+n])); index += n
        
        # Count inversions in the sorted array
        sorted_a = sorted(a)
        inversions = 0
        for i in range(n):
            inversions += a.index(sorted_a[i])
            a[a.index(sorted_a[i])] = -1  # Mark as processed
        
        results.append(inversions)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This program reads the input data, sorts the array, and counts the number of inversions, which corresponds to the minimum possible penalty.
