Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k-1`
   - `n` must be greater than `1`
   - The last element of `a` is either less than or equal to `lit[i]`
   - If the last element of `a` is less than `lit[i]`, then `b` contains `lit[i]`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each time, the next value of `i` will be `k`.

5. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now `k` and `n` is greater than `1`, the loop will continue if `k < n`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `k`
   - The condition `n > 1` remains the same
   - The last element of `a` and its relation to `lit[i]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop incrementing `i`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `k`, `n` must be greater than `1`, and the last element of `a` is either less than or equal to `lit[i]`. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` of `lit`, then `b` contains the element `lit[i]`. Otherwise, the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`.**
