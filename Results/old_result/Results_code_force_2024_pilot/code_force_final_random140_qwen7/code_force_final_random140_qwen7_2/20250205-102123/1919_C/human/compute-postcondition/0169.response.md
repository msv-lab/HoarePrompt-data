Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by any elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their preceding element; `s` will be the total count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `a` will hold the increasing subsequence of `lit`, starting with the first element, and `b` will hold the non-increasing subsequence. The variable `s` will store the total number of increases in the sequence `a`.
