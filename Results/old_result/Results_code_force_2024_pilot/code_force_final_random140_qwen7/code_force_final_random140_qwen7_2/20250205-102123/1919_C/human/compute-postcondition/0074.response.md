Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `b` has an additional element `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is equal to `k + 1`, the value of `lit[k + 1]` is appended to `b`. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 1 and the initial state of `i` being `k + 1` remain unchanged.
