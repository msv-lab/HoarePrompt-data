Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `lit`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
