Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `s` is `k-1`, `len(b)` is the count of elements in `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`, `a` contains the first `n` elements of `lit` in non-decreasing order, `b` contains all elements from `lit` that are strictly less than the last element of `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., when `i` reaches `n-1`), the variable `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `s` remains unchanged at `k-1`. The list `a` will contain the first `n` elements of `lit` in non-decreasing order because each time an element is appended to `a`, it is either equal to or greater than the previous element in `a`. The list `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly less than the last element of `a` because those elements were appended to `b` during the loop iterations when they met the condition `a[-1] < lit[i]`.
