Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two lists, `a` and `b`. `a` is set to contain only the first element of the list `lit`, while `b` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
