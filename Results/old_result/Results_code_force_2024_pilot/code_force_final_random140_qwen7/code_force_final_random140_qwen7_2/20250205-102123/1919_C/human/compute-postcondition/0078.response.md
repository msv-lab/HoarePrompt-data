Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `s` is `k-1`, `len(b)` is the count of elements in `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`, `a` contains the first `n` elements of `lit` in non-decreasing order, and `b` contains all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`), the variable `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. The list `a` will contain the first `n` elements of `lit` in non-decreasing order because each time an element in `lit` is appended to `a`, it is only if it is greater than or equal to the previous element in `a`. The list `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`.
