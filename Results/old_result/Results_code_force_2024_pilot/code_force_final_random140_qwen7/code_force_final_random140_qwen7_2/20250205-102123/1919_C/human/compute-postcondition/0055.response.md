Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `s` is `n-1`
- `len(b)` is `n`, which means the list `b` has `n` elements, but since it is explicitly stated that `b` is an empty list, this seems contradictory unless `n` is 0.
- `b` is an empty list.

Given that `b` is an empty list, it implies `n` must be 0. Therefore, both `i` and `s` are also 0.

So, when the `print(s)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `s`, which is `n-1` and since `n` is 0, `s` is `-1`.

Output: **-1**
