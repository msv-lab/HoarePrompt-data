Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first element of `lit` followed by any elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element, and `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to their preceding element; `s` is 0.**

This means that the variable `s` has been initialized to 0, but none of the other conditions or values have changed. The values of `i`, `a`, and `b` remain as described in the initial state.
