Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` contains the element `lit[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, `a` now contains the element `lit[3]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
