Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. For example, consider the input "0101". According to the problem description, the correct answer should be 2 (we can cut the string into "01" and "01"), but the program will output 1 because it only counts the number of "10" transitions, which does not account for the optimal way to cut the string.
