Output State: `a` is a string containing the input provided by the user, `cut` is equal to the total number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, and `t` is the initial input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `cut` will hold the total count of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be set to `len(a) - 2` because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 2`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was the initial input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and it determines how many times the outer loop will run.
