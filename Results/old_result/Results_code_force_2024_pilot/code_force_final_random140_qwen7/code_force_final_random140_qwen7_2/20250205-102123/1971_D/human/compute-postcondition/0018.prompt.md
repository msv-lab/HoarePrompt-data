Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input string, `cut` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
        cut += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input string, `cut` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`. Additionally, the character at index `i` in `a` is '1' and the character at index `i + 1` in `a` is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input string, `cut` is 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `a` is '1' and the character at index `i + 1` in `a` is '0', then `cut` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input string, `cut` is 3, `i` is 2. If the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at `i+1` is "10", then `cut` is set to 3. Otherwise, `cut` remains 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
