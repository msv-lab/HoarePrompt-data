Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a = input()
    cut = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
            cut += 1
    print(cut + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input string, `cut` is 3, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `cut` will be incremented each time the condition `a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0'` is met. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 2`, so the final value of `i` will be `len(a) - 2`. Given that the maximum number of times the loop can run is `len(a) - 2` (since it checks up to `len(a) - 2` elements), and based on the provided information, `cut` reaches its maximum value of 3 before the loop completes all its iterations. Therefore, `cut` will be 3 after the loop finishes, and `i` will be `len(a) - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is the input string provided by the user, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, and `cut` is incremented by 1 each time the condition `a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0'` is met during the loop's execution.

This means that `cut` will hold the total count of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be one less than the length of the string `a` because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, `cut` is equal to the total number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the list `a`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, and `a` is a list with more than 1 element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
