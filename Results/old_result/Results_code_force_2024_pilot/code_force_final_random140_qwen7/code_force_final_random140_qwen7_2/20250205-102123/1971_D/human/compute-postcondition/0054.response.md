Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cut` is 2
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is a list with more than 1 element
   - The current value of `a[i]` is '0'
   - The current value of `a[i + 1]` is unknown but the list must have at least 3 elements

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(a) - 1)`

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `len(a) - 1`, we need to adjust these variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 (to 2), and the loop will check if `i < len(a) - 1`.

5. **List Length:**
   - The list `a` must have at least 3 elements, so `len(a) - 1` will be at least 2.

6. **New State:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - The new value of `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is unknown.
   - The new value of `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[3]`) is unknown.
   - The list `a` must still have at least 3 elements.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`cut` is 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, the current value of `a[i]` is unknown, the current value of `a[i + 1]` is unknown**
