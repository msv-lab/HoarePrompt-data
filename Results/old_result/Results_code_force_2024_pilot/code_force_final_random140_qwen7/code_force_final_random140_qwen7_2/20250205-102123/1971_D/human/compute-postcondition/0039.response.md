To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is the input string provided by the user.
   - `i` is set to `len(a) - 1`, meaning `i` starts from the second last character of the string `a`.
   - `cut` is incremented by 1 each time the condition `a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0'` is met during the loop's execution.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(cut + 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 2`, checking if `a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0'`.
   - For each occurrence where this condition is true, `cut` is incremented.
   - After the loop, the print statement outputs `cut + 1`.

Given the above, the print statement will output the number of times '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the string `a`, plus one.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **cut + 1 (where cut is the count of occurrences where '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the string `a`)**
