Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        
        print(cut + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is an input string where the total count of occurrences where '1' is immediately followed by '0' is stored in `cut`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, and `t` is the initial input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `cut` will hold the total count of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 2`, so the final value of `i` will be `len(a) - 2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was the initial input integer specifying how many times the outer loop should run, but since we are considering the inner loop's behavior, it does not affect the final state of `a` and `cut`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of times '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the string `s`. It then prints the count plus one for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
