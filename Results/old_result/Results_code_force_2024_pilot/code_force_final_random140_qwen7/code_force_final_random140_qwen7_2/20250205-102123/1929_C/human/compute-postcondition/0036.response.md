Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 8.
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `s` is 8.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned values from the input split into integers.

We need to determine the value of `a` and `s` to evaluate the condition in the `print` statement.

From the description:
- After 3 iterations, `s` is 5.
- To reach `s` as 8 after 5 more iterations (from the 4th to the 8th), `s` must be incremented by the formula `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration.
- Since `s` is 8 after 8 iterations, and it starts from 2, we can infer that `s` must be incremented correctly to reach 8.

Given that `s` is 8 and the condition `a >= s` needs to be evaluated, and since `s` is 8, `a` must be at least 8 for the condition to be true.

Therefore, the `print` statement will evaluate `a >= 8` and print `'YES'` if `a` is greater than or equal to 8, otherwise it will print `'NO'`.

Output: **YES**
