Output State: `x` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `s` is calculated as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1` after 3 iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be at least 5 (since it must be greater than the last iteration count which was 3), `i` will still be 4 because it is not changed within the loop, and `s` will have been updated according to the loop's operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` three times.
