You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES

    YES

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). For each input, it calculates a value \( s \) using a specific formula and then checks if \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( s \). If \( a \) meets the condition, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the strategy for Sasha to ensure he can achieve any number of coins. Specifically, the program calculates `s` based on the number of consecutive losses `x`, but it does not account for the varying bet amounts and the possibility of winning after a series of losses.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 3 15`
- Expected Output: `YES`

However, the program's logic does not guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins. For instance, if Sasha starts with 15 coins and the rules are as follows:
- `k = 2`: Bet amount doubles on win.
- `x = 3`: Maximum 3 consecutive losses.

The program calculates `s` as:
\[ s = 1 + \frac{1}{2-1} + 1 = 3 \]

This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the varying bet amounts and the need to recover from losses. Sasha needs a strategy that ensures he can always increase his coin count, which the current implementation does not provide.

A correct approach would involve a dynamic programming or recursive strategy to ensure Sasha can always recover from losses and eventually achieve any desired number of coins. The current implementation fails to meet this requirement.
