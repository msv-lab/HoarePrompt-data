### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs `x` times, where in each iteration, `s` is updated to include the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can continue betting without violating the rule of not losing more than `x` times in a row.
   - Specifically, `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` ensures that `s` is incremented by the smallest possible value that allows Sasha to place a bet after `x` consecutive losses.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "YES", indicating that Sasha can achieve his goal.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Loop Control**:
   - The outer loop iterates `t` times, handling each test case correctly.
   - The loop control variables (`_` and `i`) are used appropriately within their respective scopes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all given constraints (1 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9) correctly.
   - The logic for calculating `s` ensures that Sasha can always place a bet after `x` consecutive losses, as long as he has enough coins.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

### Correctness:
