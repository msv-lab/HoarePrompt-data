Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sasha's Strategy:**
   - The provided code calculates `s` as `1 + s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations. This calculation is not aligned with the intended strategy to ensure Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n`.

2. **Strategy Misunderstanding:**
   - The strategy should be based on ensuring that Sasha can recover from a series of losses while still being able to place bets to increase his wealth. The current approach does not reflect this.

3. **Core Logic Flaw:**
   - The logic in the loop is flawed because it doesn't properly simulate the betting strategy required to ensure Sasha can eventually have any number of coins `n`. Specifically, the formula used to update `s` does not correctly represent the growth of Sasha's wealth over a series of wins and losses.

### Correct Approach:
To determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n`, we need to consider the following points:

- Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from a series of losses and still place bets to increase his wealth.
- Given the promotion rule (not losing more than `x` times in a row), Sasha can strategically place bets to ensure he can recover from losses and continue increasing his wealth.

Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        # Sasha can always win back his initial amount plus one after x losses
        # because he can place a bet of 1 coin and win back k-1 times his bet
        # and then continue this process.
        # So, after x losses, he can recover to at least a + (k-1) * x coins.
        min_coins_needed = a + (k - 1) * x
        if min_coins_needed <= a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected function checks if Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting. If the minimum coins needed (`a + (k - 1) * x`) are less than or equal to the initial amount `a`, Sasha cannot achieve the goal, hence the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is 'YES'.
