Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 8, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 1.

In this final state, the variable `s` has been updated in each iteration of the loop according to the rule `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. After 3 iterations, `s` has been incremented from its initial value of 1 to 8. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1 in each iteration, so it is now 3. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `x` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `s` is calculated as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1` after 3 iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be at least 5 (since it must be greater than the last iteration count which was 3), `i` will still be 4 because it is not changed within the loop, and `s` will have been updated according to the loop's operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` three times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 8, `x` must be greater than or equal to 6, `s` is 8, `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned values from the input split into integers.

To calculate this, we observe that the loop continues as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 6. Given that the loop increments `i` with each iteration and starts from `i=0` within the loop (since `i` in the `range(x)` function starts from 0), it will run until `i` reaches its upper limit defined by the initial value of `x`. Initially, `x` was set to a value such that after 3 iterations, `i` became 6. Therefore, to complete all iterations, `x` must be at least 8 (since `i` will increment from 0 to 7, making a total of 8 iterations). Each iteration increases `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting from `s = 2`, after 3 iterations, `s` is 5. Continuing for 5 more iterations (from the 4th to the 8th), `s` will increase to 8. Thus, the final state after all iterations is `i` being 8, `x` being at least 6, and `s` being 8.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
