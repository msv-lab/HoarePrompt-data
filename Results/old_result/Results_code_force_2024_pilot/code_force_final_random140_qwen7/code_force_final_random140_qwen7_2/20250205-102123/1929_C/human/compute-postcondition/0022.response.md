Output State: `x` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `s` is the result of repeatedly applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for as many times as `x` allows.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will determine how many times the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` was performed. The variable `i` will remain at 5 because it is not changed within the loop. The variable `s` will be the initial value of 2, incremented according to the given operation for each iteration of the loop, up to the number of times specified by `x`.
