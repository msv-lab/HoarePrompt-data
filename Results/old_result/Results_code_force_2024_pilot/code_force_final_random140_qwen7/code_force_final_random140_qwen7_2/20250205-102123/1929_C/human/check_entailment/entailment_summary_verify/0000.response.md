### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- Sasha needs to ensure he can achieve any number of coins \( n \).
- The casino rules dictate that if Sasha wins, his coins increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \) where \( y \) is the bet amount.
- If Sasha loses, he loses the entire bet amount \( y \).
- Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
- Initially, Sasha has \( a \) coins.

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
- It calculates a value \( s \) using a specific formula and then checks if \( a \geq s \).
- If \( a \geq s \), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Calculation of \( s \)**:
   - The formula used in the program is \( s = 1 + \frac{1}{k-1} + 1 \) repeated \( x \) times.
   - This simplifies to \( s = 1 + \frac{x}{k-1} + x \).
   - This calculation does not account for the varying bet amounts and the need to recover from losses.

2. **Strategy for Sasha**:
   - The program does not provide a strategy for Sasha to ensure he can achieve any number of coins.
   - The calculation of \( s \) is a fixed value based on the number of consecutive losses \( x \), but it does not reflect the dynamic nature of the game where Sasha can win and recover from losses.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case \( (2, 1, 7) \):
     - The program calculates \( s = 1 + \frac{1}{2-1} + 1 = 3 \).
     - Since \( 7 \geq 3 \), it prints 'YES'.
   - For the test case \( (2, 1, 1) \):
     - The program calculates \( s = 3 \).
     - Since \( 1 < 3 \), it prints 'NO'.
   - These results align with the expected outputs provided in the example.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies when Sasha can achieve the required number of coins based on the given constraints.
   - The logic in the program is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not account for the varying bet amounts and the need to recover from losses. However, upon closer inspection, the program correctly implements the strategy for Sasha to ensure he can achieve any number of coins within the given constraints.

**Final: True**
