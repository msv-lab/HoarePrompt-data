Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be greater than 4.
   - `i` is 5.

4. **Determine if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - Given `i` is 5, for the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 5.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is 5, it cannot be less than `x` unless `x` is increased.
   - Therefore, `x` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` remains 5 because the increment happens within the loop body, not in the loop head.

6. **Final state**:
   - `x` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` is 5.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` must be greater than 5, `i` is 5**
