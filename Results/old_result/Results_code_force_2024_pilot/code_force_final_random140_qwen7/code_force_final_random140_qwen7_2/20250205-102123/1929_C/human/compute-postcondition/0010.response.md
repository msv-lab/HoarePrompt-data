Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 8, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 1.

In this final state, the variable `s` has been updated in each iteration of the loop according to the rule `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. After 3 iterations, `s` has been incremented from its initial value of 1 to 8. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1 in each iteration, so it is now 3. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
