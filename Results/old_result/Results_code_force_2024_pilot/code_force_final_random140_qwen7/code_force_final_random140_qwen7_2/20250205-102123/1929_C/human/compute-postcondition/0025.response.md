Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` must be greater than or equal to 5.
   - `i` is 5.
   - `s` is calculated as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1` after 3 iterations.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for a number of iterations specified by `int(input())`.
   - The loop variable `_` is used, meaning it doesn't affect the state directly.
   - The loop body is omitted, but it updates `s` based on the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

4. **Current State Before Next Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state before the next iteration starts.
   - Since the loop variable `_` is not used, it does not change the values of `x`, `i`, or `s`.
   - The value of `i` remains 5 because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `x` must be greater than or equal to 5 because it must be at least the number of iterations plus 1 (since it started from 3 and incremented by 1 each time).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` remains 5.
   - `x` must be greater than or equal to 6 (since it must be at least the number of iterations plus 1, and the loop will run one more time).
   - `s` will be updated according to the loop's operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `x` must be greater than or equal to 6, `i` is 5, `s` is calculated as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1` after 4 iterations.**
