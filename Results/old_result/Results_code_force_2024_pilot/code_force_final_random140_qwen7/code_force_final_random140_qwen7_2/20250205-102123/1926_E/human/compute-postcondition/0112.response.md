Output State: `m` is 16, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `n_back` is equal to 1.

Explanation: After the first three iterations, `m` doubles each time `n` becomes 0, which happens every two iterations. Starting from `m` being 1 initially, after 3 iterations, `m` would be \(2^4 = 16\). The condition `n == 0` triggers the break statement, causing `s` to be set to `n_back`, which remains 1, and then `n` is reset to 1. Since `n` is now 1 and the condition `n == 0` is no longer met, the loop will exit. Therefore, after all iterations, `m` will be 16, `n` will be 0, `s` will be 0 (as it gets updated to `n_back` and then stays there), and the other variables (`_`, `k`, `n_back`) will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
