Output State: **`m` is 8, `_` is 0, `n` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Given that `m` was initially 4, after executing the code, `m` becomes 8. The values of `_`, `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
