Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `n_back` is initialized to `n`.
   - `s` is set to `(n + 1) // 2`, which counts the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - `n` is also set to `(n + 1) // 2`, representing the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - `m` is initialized to `1`.

3. **Loop to Determine the Position:**
   - The loop continues while `s < k`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `n` becomes zero, it resets `s` to `n_back` and sets `n` to `1`.
     - Multiplies `m` by `2` and divides `n` by `2`.
     - Adds `n` to `s` to count the number of cards that are multiples of `m`.

4. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - After exiting the loop, the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` is used to calculate the k-th card.

### Verification of Logic

1. **Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - The initial `s` and `n` correctly represent the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - When `m` is `1`, the formula should return the k-th odd-numbered card.

2. **Multiples of Even Numbers:**
   - The loop increments `m` by multiplying it by `2` and adjusts `n` accordingly.
   - The logic for counting the number of cards that are multiples of `m` seems correct.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` should correctly compute the k-th card after accounting for the previous groups of cards.

### Testing with Examples
