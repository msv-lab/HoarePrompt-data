Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `s < k`.

2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to ensure that the loop condition `s < k` is true for the first iteration.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `m` is 1.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `k` is greater than 1.
   - `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `n_back` is equal to `n`.

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `s < k`.
   - Currently, `s` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2` and `k` is greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be less than `k`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `s` is exactly equal to `(n + 1) // 2` and `k` is greater than 1, `s` must be made strictly less than `k` for the loop to execute the first time.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `s` to be less than `k`.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be modified such that `s` is less than `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is (n + 1) // 2, `k` is greater than 1, `s` must be less than `k`, `n_back` is equal to `n`**
