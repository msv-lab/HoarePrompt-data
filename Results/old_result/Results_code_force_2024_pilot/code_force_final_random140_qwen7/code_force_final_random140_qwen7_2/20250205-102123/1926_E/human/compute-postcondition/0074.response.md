Output State: `m` is 16, `_` is 2, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, `m` doubles, `n` is halved, and `s` increases by the value of `n`. The loop continues until `s` is no longer less than `k`. Given that the loop executed 3 times and then stopped, we can infer that after 3 iterations, `s` became equal to or greater than `k`. Since `m` doubles each time and starts at 1, after 4 iterations (`m` would be \(2^4 = 16\)), `s` reaches 0 (as it does after the 3rd iteration), indicating that the condition `s < k` is no longer true. Therefore, the final state after all iterations is `m` being 16, `n` being 0, `s` being 0, and `k` remaining greater than 1.
