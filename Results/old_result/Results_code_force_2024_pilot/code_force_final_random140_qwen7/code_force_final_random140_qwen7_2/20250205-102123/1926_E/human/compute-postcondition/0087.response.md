Output State: **`m` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1, `n_back` is equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we know a break occurred. All other variables retain their initial values.
