Output State: `m` is 16, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `s < k`. Given the output state after the loop executes 3 times, we can infer that `s` will eventually become equal to or greater than `k` after a certain number of iterations. Since `m` doubles with each iteration and `n` is halved, after 4 iterations (`m` would be 16), `n` would become 0, and the loop condition `s < k` would no longer be satisfied because `s` would remain 1 (as `n` is 0 and adding 0 does not change `s`). Therefore, the loop terminates, and the final values are `m` is 16, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, and `s` is 1.
