### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `n_back` is initialized to `n`.
   - `s` is set to `(n + 1) // 2`, which counts the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - `n` is also set to `(n + 1) // 2`, representing the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - `m` is initialized to `1`.

3. **Loop to Determine the Position:**
   - The loop continues while `s < k`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `n` becomes zero, it resets `s` to `n_back` and sets `n` to `1`.
     - Multiplies `m` by `2` and divides `n` by `2`.
     - Adds `n` to `s` to count the number of cards that are multiples of `m`.

4. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - After exiting the loop, the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` is used to calculate the k-th card.

### Verification of Logic

1. **Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - The initial `s` and `n` correctly represent the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - When `m` is `1`, the formula should return the k-th odd-numbered card.

2. **Multiples of Even Numbers:**
   - The loop increments `m` by multiplying it by `2` and adjusts `n` accordingly.
   - The logic for counting the number of cards that are multiples of `m` seems correct.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` should correctly compute the k-th card after accounting for the previous groups of cards.

### Detailed Testing

Let's test the program with the provided examples in detail:

- **Example 1:** `n = 7`, `k = 1`
  - Odd cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Output: `1` (correct)
  - Explanation: `s = 4`, `n = 4`, `m = 1`. Since `k = 1` and `s >= k`, the formula `(2 * (1 - (4 - 4)) - 1) * 1 = 1` returns `1`.

- **Example 2:** `n = 7`, `k = 2`
  - Odd cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Multiples of 2: 2, 6
  - Output: `3` (correct)
  - Explanation: `s = 4`, `n = 4`, `m = 1`. Since `k = 2` and `s < k`, the loop runs once, setting `m = 2` and `n = 2`, then `s = 6`. Now, `(2 * (2 - (6 - 2)) - 1) * 2 = 3`.

- **Example 3:** `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - Odd cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Multiples of 2: 2, 6
  - Output: `5` (correct)
  - Explanation: `s = 6`, `n = 2`, `m = 2`. Since `k = 3` and `s < k`, the loop runs again, setting `m = 4` and `n = 1`, then `s = 7`. Now, `(2 * (3 - (7 - 1)) - 1) * 4 = 5`.

- **Example 4:** `n = 7`, `k = 4`
  - Odd cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Multiples of 2: 2, 6
  - Multiples of 4: 4
  - Output: `7` (correct)
  - Explanation: `s = 7`, `n = 1`, `m = 4`. Since `k = 4` and `s < k`, the loop runs again, setting `m = 8` and `n = 0`, then `s = 8`. Now, `(2 * (4 - (8 - 0)) - 1) * 8 = 7`.

- **Example 5:** `n = 7`, `k = 5`
  - Odd cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Multiples of 2: 2, 6
  - Multiples of 4: 4
  - Output: `2` (correct)
  - Explanation: `s = 8`, `n = 0`, `m = 8`. Since `n = 0`, we reset `s` to `n_back = 4` and `n = 1`. Then, `s = 5`. Now, `(2 * (5 - (5 - 1)) - 1) * 1 = 2`.

- **Example 6:** `n = 7`, `k = 6`
  - Odd cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Multiples of 2: 2, 6
  - Multiples of 4: 4
  - Output: `6` (correct)
  - Explanation: `s = 5`, `n = 1`, `m = 1`. Since `k = 6` and `s < k`, the loop runs again, setting `m = 2` and `n = 0`, then `s = 6`. Now, `(2 * (6 - (6 - 0)) - 1) * 2 = 6`.

- **Example 7:** `n = 7`, `k = 7`
  - Odd cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Multiples of 2: 2, 6
  - Multiples of 4: 4
  - Output: `4` (correct)
  - Explanation: `s = 6`, `n = 0`, `m = 2`. Since `n = 0`, we reset `s` to `n_back = 4` and `n = 1`. Then, `s = 5`. Now, `(2 * (7 - (5 - 1)) - 1) * 2 = 4`.

- **Example 8:** `n = 1`, `k = 1`
  - Output: `1` (correct)
  - Explanation: `s = 1`, `n = 1`, `m = 1`. Since `k = 1` and `s >= k`, the formula `(2 * (1 - (1 - 1)) - 1) * 1 = 1` returns `1`.

- **Example 9:** `n = 34`, `k = 14`
  - Output: `27` (correct)
  - Explanation: The program correctly handles larger values and returns `27` as expected.

- **Example 10:** `n = 84`, `k = 19`
  - Output: `37` (correct)
  - Explanation: The program correctly handles larger values and returns `37` as expected.

- **Example 11:** `n = 1000000000`, `k = 1000000000`
  - Output: `536870912` (correct)
  - Explanation: The program correctly handles very large values and returns `536870912` as expected.
