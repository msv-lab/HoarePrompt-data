Output State: **`m` is 16, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is (n + 1) // 2, `n_back` is equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `(n + 1) // 2` to `s`. Since `n` is an input integer, `s` will be the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The values of `m`, `_`, `k`, and `n_back` remain unchanged.
