Output State: **`m` is 2, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, and `s` is updated to 1.**

Explanation: The code `s += n` increments the value of `s` by the value of `n`. Given that `n` is 0, `s` remains unchanged at 1. All other variables (`m`, `_`, `k`, `s`, `n_back`) retain their original values from the initial state.
