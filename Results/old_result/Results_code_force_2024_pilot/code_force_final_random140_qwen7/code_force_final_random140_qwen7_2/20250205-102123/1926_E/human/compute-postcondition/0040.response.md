Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `m` is 16
   - `_` is 1
   - `n` is 0
   - `k` is greater than 1
   - `n_back` is equal to 1
   - `s` is 1

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `s < k`. Given that `s` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1, the loop will continue to execute as long as `s` remains 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` must be incremented by 1. The variable `t` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the state**: After the next iteration, `_` will be 2, and all other variables will remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`m` is 16, `_` is 2, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is 1**
