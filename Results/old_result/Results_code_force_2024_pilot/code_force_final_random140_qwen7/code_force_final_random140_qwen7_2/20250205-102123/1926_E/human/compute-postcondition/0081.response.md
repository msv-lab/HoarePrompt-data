Output State: **`m` is 16, `_` is 0, `n` is (n + 1) // 2, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is (n + 1) // 2, `n_back` is equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` was an input integer, its new value is `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
