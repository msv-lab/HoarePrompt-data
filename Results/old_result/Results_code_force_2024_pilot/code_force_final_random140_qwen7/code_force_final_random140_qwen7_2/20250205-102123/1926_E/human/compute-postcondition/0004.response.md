Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `n_back` is equal to `n`, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

This means that the variable `s` has been assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
