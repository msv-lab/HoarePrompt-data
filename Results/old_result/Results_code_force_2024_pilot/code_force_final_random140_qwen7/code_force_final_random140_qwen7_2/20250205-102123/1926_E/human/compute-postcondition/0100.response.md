Output State: **`m` is 4, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Given the initial state where `n` is 1, `1 // 2` results in 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
