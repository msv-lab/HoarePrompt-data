Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `n_back` is equal to `n`, `s` is `(n_back + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` was initially equal to `n_back`, the new value of `n` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
