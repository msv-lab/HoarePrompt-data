Output State: **`m` is 16, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 1, `s` is 0**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `m`, `_`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is stated to be greater than 1, which remains true regardless of the input for `k`. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described.
