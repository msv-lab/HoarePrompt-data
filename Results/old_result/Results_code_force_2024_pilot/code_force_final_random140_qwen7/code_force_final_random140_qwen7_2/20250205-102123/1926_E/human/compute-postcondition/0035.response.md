Output State: **`m` is 8, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to 1, `s` is equal to 1 (previously) plus `n` which is 0, so `s` is still 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this case, `s` is incremented by `n`, and since `n` is 0, `s` remains unchanged at 1. All other variables retain their initial or previously mentioned states.
