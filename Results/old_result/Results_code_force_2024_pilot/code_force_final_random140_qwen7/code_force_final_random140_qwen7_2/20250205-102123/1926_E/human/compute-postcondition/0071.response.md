Output State: **`m` is 8, `_` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be greater than 4, `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Since the initial value of `m` is 4, after executing the code, `m` becomes 8. The values of `_`, `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
