Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `s`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `s < k`.

3. **Current state of `s`**: According to the given state, `s` is equal to `(n_back + 1) // 2`. Since `n_back` is equal to `n`, `s` is also equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

4. **Condition to satisfy the loop**: For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be less than `k`. Therefore, `s` should be adjusted to be less than `k`.

Given that `s` is currently `(n + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that `(n + 1) // 2 < k`.

Since `n` is defined as `(n_back + 1) // 2` and `n_back` is equal to `n`, `n` itself is `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `(n + 1) // 2 < k`.

To summarize, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `s` (which is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`) to ensure that it is less than `k`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `n_back` is equal to `n`, `s` must be less than `k`, `m` is 1**
