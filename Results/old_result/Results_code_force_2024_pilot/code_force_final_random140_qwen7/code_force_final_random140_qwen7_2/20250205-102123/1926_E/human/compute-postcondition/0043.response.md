Output State: **`m` is 16, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 1, `n_back` is equal to `n`, `s` is 8**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `s` depends on the value of `n`. However, we know that `n` is an input integer, so we express `s` as `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
