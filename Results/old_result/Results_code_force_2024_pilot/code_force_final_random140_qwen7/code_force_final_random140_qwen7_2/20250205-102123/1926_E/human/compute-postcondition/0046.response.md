Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s < k`.
2. **Identify the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `s` and `k`.
3. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `s` is currently 8.
   - `k` is greater than 1.

4. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `s < k` must be true.
   - Currently, `s` is 8, and `k` is greater than 1. Since 8 is not less than any number greater than 1, the condition `s < k` is false based on the given information.

5. **Adjust the state to make the loop execute the first time**:
   - We need to change either `s` or `k` such that `s < k` becomes true.
   - Since `k` is already greater than 1, we can decrease `s` to make `s < k` true. The smallest possible value for `s` that would satisfy the condition is any value less than `k`.

Given that `k` is greater than 1, let's assume the smallest possible value for `k` is 2 (since it's greater than 1). Therefore, `s` needs to be less than 2.

So, we need to adjust `s` to be less than `k`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` is 1, `_` is 2, `n` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`, `k` is greater than 1, `s` must be less than `k`**
