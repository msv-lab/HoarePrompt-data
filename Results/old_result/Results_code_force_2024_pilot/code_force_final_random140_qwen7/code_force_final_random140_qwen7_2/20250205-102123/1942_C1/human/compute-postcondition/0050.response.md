Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is at least 4, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a list of length `x` containing integers sorted in ascending order with the last element being `n + arr[0]`**.

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid, so `t - 1` must still be greater than 0.
