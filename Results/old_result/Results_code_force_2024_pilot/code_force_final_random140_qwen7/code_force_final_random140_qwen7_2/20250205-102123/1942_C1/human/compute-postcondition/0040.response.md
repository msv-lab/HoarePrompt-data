Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` must be at least 4; `ans` is 1**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given that `ans` was initially not specified, we assume it was 0 (since no initial value was given), and after executing the code, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
