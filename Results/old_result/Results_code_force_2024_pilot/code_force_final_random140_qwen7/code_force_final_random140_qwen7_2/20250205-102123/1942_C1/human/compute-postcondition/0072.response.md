Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 8.
   - `x` is at least 7 (though the value of `x` itself is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `ans` is 1 if `arr[8] - arr[7]` equals 2; otherwise, `ans` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(ans)`.

Given the conditions:
- Since `ans` is defined as 1 if `arr[8] - arr[7]` equals 2, and it is explicitly stated that `ans` is 1 regardless of whether the condition is met or not, `ans` will be 1.

Therefore, the print statement will simply output the value of `ans`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
