Output State: **i is 8, x is at least 7, and ans is 1 if arr[8] - arr[7] equals 2; otherwise, ans is 1.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = x`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 6. Since the loop continues until `i` reaches `x`, and given that `x` is at least 5, we can infer that `x` must be at least 7 after all iterations (since `i` starts from 4 and increases by 1 each iteration). The value of `ans` will be incremented by 1 only if the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is met during any iteration. Based on the provided output states, it seems the condition was met once, so `ans` is 1. If the condition is not met for the remaining iterations, `ans` remains 1.
