Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, and the current value of `__name__` is `'__main__'`; `arr` is a list of three integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. The original values of `t` and `__name__` remain unchanged, and the list `[n, x, y]` is replaced by `arr`, which contains the split input.
