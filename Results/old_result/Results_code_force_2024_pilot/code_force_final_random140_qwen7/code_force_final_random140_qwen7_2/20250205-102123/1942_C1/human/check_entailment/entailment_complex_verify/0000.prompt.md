You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            arr.sort()
            
            arr.append(n + arr[0])
            
            ans = x - 2
            
            for i in range(1, x + 1):
                if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2:
                    ans += 1
            
            print(ans)
            
        #State: i is 2*t, x is at least t, ans is the count of pairs (arr[j+1] - arr[j] == 2) for j in range(x-1), t is 0.
    #State: t is 0, x is at least 2*t, ans is the count of pairs (arr[j+1] - arr[j] == 2) for j in range(x-1).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving integers t, n, x, and y. It verifies that t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and the minimum of n or 2⋅10^5, and y is always 0. Additionally, it ensures that the sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. For each test case, it sorts a list of x integers, appends a specific value to this list, and counts the number of pairs where consecutive elements differ by 2. The function then prints this count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that the chosen vertices must be used to form non-intersecting diagonals, and the goal is to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake.

The program calculates `ans` as `x - 2`, which is simply the number of gaps between the chosen vertices minus 2. However, this approach does not ensure that the chosen vertices form non-intersecting diagonals, nor does it maximize the number of triangles.

For example, consider the input:
```
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `3`. Here's a valid construction:
- Choose vertices 1, 2, 5, and 6.
- Form triangles with diagonals (1, 5), (2, 6), and (1, 2).

The program does not handle the formation of non-intersecting diagonals and thus cannot guarantee the maximum number of triangular pieces. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
