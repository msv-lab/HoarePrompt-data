Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially not mentioned to have any specific value, we assume it was 0 before this line of code. After executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
