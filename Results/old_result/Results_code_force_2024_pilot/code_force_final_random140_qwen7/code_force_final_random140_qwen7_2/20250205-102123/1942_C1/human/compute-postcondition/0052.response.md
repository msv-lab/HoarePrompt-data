Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is at least 4, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a list of strings obtained from user input, `[n, x, y]` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` takes a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, `t`, and the initial definition of `arr` as a list of integers sorted in ascending order with the last element being `n + arr[0]` remain unchanged. The new `arr` is a list of strings, and `[n, x, y]` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from user input.
