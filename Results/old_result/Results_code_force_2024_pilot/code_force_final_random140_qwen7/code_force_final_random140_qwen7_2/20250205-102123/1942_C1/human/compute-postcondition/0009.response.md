Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of four integers where the last element is `n + arr[0]`, `t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, and `ans` is `x - 2`.**

The code `ans = x - 2` assigns the value of `x - 2` to the variable `ans`. The other variables (`arr` and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
