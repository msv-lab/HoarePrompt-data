Output State: **i is 4, x is a non-negative integer and at least 4, and ans is 1 if arr[4] - arr[3] equals 2; otherwise, ans remains unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 4, `x` will be a non-negative integer and at least 4. The value of `ans` will be 1 if the difference between `arr[4]` and `arr[3]` is exactly 2; otherwise, `ans` will retain its previous value.
