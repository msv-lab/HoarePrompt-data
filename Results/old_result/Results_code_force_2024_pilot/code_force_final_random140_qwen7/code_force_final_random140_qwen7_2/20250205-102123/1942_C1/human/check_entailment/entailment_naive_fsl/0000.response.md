Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that the chosen vertices must be used to form non-intersecting diagonals, and the goal is to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake.

The program calculates `ans` as `x - 2`, which is simply the number of gaps between the chosen vertices minus 2. However, this approach does not ensure that the chosen vertices form non-intersecting diagonals, nor does it maximize the number of triangles.

For example, consider the input:
```
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `3`. Here's a valid construction:
- Choose vertices 1, 2, 5, and 6.
- Form triangles with diagonals (1, 5), (2, 6), and (1, 2).

The program does not handle the formation of non-intersecting diagonals and thus cannot guarantee the maximum number of triangular pieces. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
