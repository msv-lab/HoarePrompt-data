Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, and the current value of `__name__` is `'__main__'`; `[n, x, y]` is a list of three integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input separated by spaces and assigns them to the list `[n, x, y]`. The value of `t` and the current value of `__name__` remain unchanged.
