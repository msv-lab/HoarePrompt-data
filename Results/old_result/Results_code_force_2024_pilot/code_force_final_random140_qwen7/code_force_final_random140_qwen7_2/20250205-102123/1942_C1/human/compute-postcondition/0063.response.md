Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`, meaning it starts at `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` reaches `x + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `x` must be at least 4.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts at `1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `5`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `4` and `x` is at least `4`, the next value of `i` (which is `5`) will still satisfy the condition `i <= x + 1` because `x` is at least `4`, making `x + 1` at least `5`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `5`.
   - `x` must remain at least `4`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 5, `x` must be at least 4**.
