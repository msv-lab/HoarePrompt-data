Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 4, `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `[n, x, y]` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and splits them into a list `[n, x, y]`. The values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. `i` is still 4, `x` is still a non-negative integer and at least 4, `ans` remains unchanged, and `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1.
