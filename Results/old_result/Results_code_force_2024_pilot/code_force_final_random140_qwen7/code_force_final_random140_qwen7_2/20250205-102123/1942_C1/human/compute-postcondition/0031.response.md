Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 4, `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `arr` is a list of length `x` containing integers sorted in ascending order with the last element being `n + arr[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `n + arr[0]` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially a list of length `x` containing integers sorted in ascending order, after appending `n + arr[0]`, the list `arr` will still be sorted in ascending order, with the new last element being `n + arr[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
