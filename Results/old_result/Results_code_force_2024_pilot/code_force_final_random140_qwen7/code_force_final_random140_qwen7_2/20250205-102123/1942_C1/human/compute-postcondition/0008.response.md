Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of four integers where the last element is `n + arr[0]`, `t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, and the current value of `__name__` is `'__main__'`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `n + arr[0]` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially a sorted list of three integers, appending `n + arr[0]` results in a sorted list of four integers, with the last element being `n + arr[0]`. The values of `t` and `__name__` remain unchanged.
