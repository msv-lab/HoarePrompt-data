Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = x`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` must be at least 4.
   - If the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 2) must still be less than or equal to `x`.
   - Therefore, `x` must remain at least 4.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `x` must still be at least 4.

Given this analysis, the updated states are:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be at least 4**
