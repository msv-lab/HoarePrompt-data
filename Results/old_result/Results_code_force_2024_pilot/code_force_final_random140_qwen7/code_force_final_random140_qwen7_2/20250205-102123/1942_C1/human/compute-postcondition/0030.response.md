Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 4, `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `arr` is a list of length `x` containing integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in place in ascending order. The values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged, and `arr` is updated to contain its elements sorted.
