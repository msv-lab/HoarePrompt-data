Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is at least 4, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input, each element being an integer in the range [0, x-1].**

Explanation: The code replaces the original `arr` which was a list of strings with a new list where each element is converted to an integer. The length of this new list is `x`, and each element is an integer obtained from user input and falls within the range [0, x-1]. The other variables remain unchanged.
