Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is at least 4, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, each element being an integer in the range [0, x-1]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, `t`, and the nature of `arr` (a list of integers in the range [0, x-1]) remain unchanged, but now `arr` is sorted.
