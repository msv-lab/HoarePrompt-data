Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `ans` is 1**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given that `ans` was initially 0 (implied from the precondition that `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, which doesn't specify an initial value for `ans`, and typical default behavior), after executing the code, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
