Output State: **i is 4, x is at least 4, ans is either 1 or 2, t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, arr is a list of length x containing integers sorted in ascending order with the last element being n + arr[0].**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `x` inclusive. However, since the loop increments `i` at each step, `i` will be `x` at the end of the loop but the condition `i in range(1, x + 1)` ensures `i` reaches up to `x`. Given the initial value of `i` is 4, and the loop continues until `i` is less than or equal to `x`, `i` will be 4 when the loop ends, meaning the loop has run exactly `x - 4 + 1 = x - 3` times. The value of `x` remains at least 4. The variable `ans` is incremented by 1 each time the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is met. Since the loop runs for `x - 3` times, `ans` will be 2 if the condition is met at least once, otherwise, it remains 1. The variable `t` is decreased by 1 each iteration, so it will be `t - (x - 3) > 0`. The list `arr` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the loop.
