Output State: **t is assigned the value of int(input()), which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The current value of __name__ is '__main__'.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the new value of `t` is now the integer input provided by the user, while the precondition for `__name__` remains unchanged.
