Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, and the current value of `__name__` is `'__main__'`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), after decrementing by 1, `t` will now be a positive integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive). The value of `__name__` remains unchanged as it is set to `'__main__'` by default when the script is run directly.
