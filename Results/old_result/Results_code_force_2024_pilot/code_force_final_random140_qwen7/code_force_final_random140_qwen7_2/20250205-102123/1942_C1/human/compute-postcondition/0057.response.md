Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop condition is `range(1, x + 1)`. This means the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i <= x`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be within the range `[1, x]`. Given that `i` is initially 4, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 4 (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `x`).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` is already set to 4, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - The variable `x` must be at least 4 for the loop to start. Since `x` is stated to be "at least 4", this condition is already met.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is 4 (no adjustment needed).
- `x` must be at least 4 (already satisfied).

Therefore, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `x` must be at least 4**
