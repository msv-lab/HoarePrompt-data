Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 4.
   - `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 4. This means `x >= 4`.
   - `ans` is 1 if `arr[4] - arr[3]` equals 2; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(ans)`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` depends on the values of `arr[4]` and `arr[3]`. However, since the actual values of `arr[4]` and `arr[3]` are not provided, we need to consider the condition under which `ans` would be set to 1.

- If `arr[4] - arr[3] == 2`, then `ans` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is not specified but implied to be 1 if no other conditions change it.

Since the problem does not provide the values of `arr[4]` and `arr[3]`, we cannot determine if `arr[4] - arr[3]` equals 2. Therefore, we assume that `ans` remains 1 unless otherwise specified.

Output: **1**
