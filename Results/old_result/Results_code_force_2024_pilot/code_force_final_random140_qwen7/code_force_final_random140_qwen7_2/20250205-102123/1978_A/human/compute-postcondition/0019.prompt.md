Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is the integer input by the user after stripping whitespace.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    ls = input().split()
    last = int(ls.pop())
    other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
    print(last + other)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings without its last element, `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest integer value in the original `ls`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings with one less element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the original list `ls` converted to an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input split from the input string, `ls` is a list of strings without the last element, `last` is the last element of the original `ls` converted to an integer, `other` is the second largest element in the original list `ls` converted to an integer and sorted, then popped.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
