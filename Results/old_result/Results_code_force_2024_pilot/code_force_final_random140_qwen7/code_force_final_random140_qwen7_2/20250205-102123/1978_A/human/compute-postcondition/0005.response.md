Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings without its last element, `last` is the integer value of the last element of the original `ls`, `other` is the second largest integer value in the original `ls`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `ls` and removes the last element (which is stored in `last`). It then pops the second last element from the sorted list, which is the second largest integer in the original list `ls` (stored in `other`). The other variables remain unchanged.
