Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `ls = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into multiple substrings based on whitespace, and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `ls`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` retains its original value as an input integer.
