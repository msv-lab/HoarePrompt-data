Reasoning:
- The problem requires Alice to divide the books into two piles such that the sum of the maximum number of pages in each pile is maximized.
- The provided program attempts to solve this by finding the largest and second-largest values in the list of pages for each test case and printing their sum.
- However, the program's logic is flawed because it incorrectly removes elements from the list using `pop()` without sorting the entire list properly.
- Specifically, `last = int(ls.pop())` removes the last element from the list, and `other = int(sorted(ls).pop())` sorts the list and then removes the last element of the sorted list, which is not necessarily the second-largest element in the original list.

To fix this, we need to sort the list of pages and then take the last (largest) and second-to-last (second-largest) elements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
