Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input().strip())` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace (if present), converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
