Output State: **`i` is 2; `cnt` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is not given a specific value in the initial state, but it is implied that it starts at 0 since it is not defined otherwise. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
