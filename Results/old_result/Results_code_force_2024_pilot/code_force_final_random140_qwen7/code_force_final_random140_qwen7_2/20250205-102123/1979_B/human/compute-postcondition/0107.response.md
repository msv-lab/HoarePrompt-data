Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is executed, the loop or conditional block that was checking `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]` is exited. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as no assignment or modification is performed on them within the given code snippet.
