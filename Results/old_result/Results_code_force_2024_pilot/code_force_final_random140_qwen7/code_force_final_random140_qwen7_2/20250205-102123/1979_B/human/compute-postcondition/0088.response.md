Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and the length of `l2` is one more than the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `l2`. Since `l2` originally contained all binary digits of `y` in reverse order, appending `0` increases its length by 1. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `l1`) remain unchanged.
