Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is [0], `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` (in reverse order)**.

Explanation: The code `l1.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `l1`. Initially, `l1` is an empty list, so after appending `0`, `l1` becomes `[0]`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `l2` remain unchanged. The condition about the lengths of `l1` and `l2` also remains valid, as `l1` now has a length of 1, which is still less than the length of `l2` (which is 0 since `y` is 0).
