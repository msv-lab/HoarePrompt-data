Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is halved, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the new `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value of the new `y % 2`, and the value of `y` is halved.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` was previously "halved" (meaning it was already an integer resulting from division by 2), dividing it by 2 again results in its value being further halved. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `l1`, and `l2`) remain unchanged.
