Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0.5, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[1]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `l1.append(x % 2)` appends the result of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Given that `x` is 0.5, `x % 2` evaluates to 0.5 % 2, which is 0.5. Therefore, `l1` changes from `[0]` to `[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
