Output State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed, meaning `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each index `i` where `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, and the loop has either continued until all elements were checked or broken if there was a mismatch.**

In this final state, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of indices where the corresponding elements in `l1` and `l2` are equal. The lists `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged, representing the length of the lists `l1` and `l2`.
