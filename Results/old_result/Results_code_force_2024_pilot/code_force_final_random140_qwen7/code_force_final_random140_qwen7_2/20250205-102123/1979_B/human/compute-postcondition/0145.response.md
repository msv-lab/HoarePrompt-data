Output State: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[1, 1]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` has been set to 0 through the process of converting it to binary and appending each bit to `l2`. Since `x` was an integer, and the loop processed its binary representation from least significant to most significant bit, `l1` retains the last three bits of `x` before it became zero. Given that `l1` is `[1, 0, 0]`, it means the last three bits of `x` were `001`, making the final value of `x` 0. The loop has completed, and `y` is also 0 since it was fully divided down to 0 during the loop's iterations.
