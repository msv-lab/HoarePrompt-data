Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 3, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(l1)` calculates the length of the list `l1` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `l1` is initially `[1, 0, 0]`, its length is 3, so `n` is set to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
