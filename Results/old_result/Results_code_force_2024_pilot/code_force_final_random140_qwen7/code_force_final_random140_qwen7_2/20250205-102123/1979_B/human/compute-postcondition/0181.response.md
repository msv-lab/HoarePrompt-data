Output State: **i is 3, n must be greater than 1, cnt is either 1 or 0, t must be greater than 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is [1, 0, 0].**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 3 because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The loop condition `i < n` ensures that `i` does not exceed `n-1`. Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds a mismatch between `l1[i]` and `l2[i]`, `cnt` will be 1 if the first two elements are the same and the third one differs, or `cnt` will remain 0 if any of the first three elements differ. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
