The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \) (0 ≤ \( x \), \( y \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it converts \( x \) and \( y \) into their binary representations, pads them to the same length, and then counts the number of matching bits from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. Finally, it prints \( 2 \) raised to the power of the count of matching bits.
