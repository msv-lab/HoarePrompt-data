Output State: **`i` is 3, `cnt` is 1**

The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (since it's not defined in the initial state, we assume it to be 0 for calculation purposes). Given that `i` remains unchanged at 3 and `n` must be greater than 1 (which is not directly affected by the code), the output state reflects these changes.
