Output State: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[1, 1]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` remains 0 because it became 0 after the third iteration when `x` was floored to 0 in integer division. The variable `y` also remains 0 since it was reduced to 0 during the third iteration. The list `l1` still contains `[1, 0, 0]`, which represents the last three bits of the original integer value of `x`. The list `l2` contains `[1, 1]`, which are the binary digits of `y` after the loop has run three times.
