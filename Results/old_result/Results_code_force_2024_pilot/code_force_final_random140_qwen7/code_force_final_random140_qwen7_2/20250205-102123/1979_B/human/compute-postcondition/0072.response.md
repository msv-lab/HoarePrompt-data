Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` must be non-zero, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `l1.append(x % 2)` appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Initially, `l1` contains `[1, 0]`. After appending `x % 2`, `l1` becomes `[1, 0, x % 2]`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
