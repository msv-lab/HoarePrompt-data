Postcondition: `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, and `l2` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended. Otherwise, the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`.
