Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 1
   - `cnt` is 1

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1 (since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`).

5. **Update the State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Given that `t` was decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be 0 or greater for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0**
