Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` is the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the list `l1`. Since `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` (which is 0) in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l1` is `[0]`. Therefore, the length of `l1` is 1. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `l1`, and `l2` remain unchanged. The new variable `n` is assigned the value 1, which is the length of `l1`.
