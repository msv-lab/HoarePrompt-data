Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is `x // 2`, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list.**

The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
