Output State: `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of `y` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is non-zero. Since `x` is being halved each iteration (`x //= 2`), it will eventually become zero when all its bits have been processed. After the loop completes, `x` will be 0, and `l1` will contain the binary representation of the original value of `x` (which was derived from `y`), but in reverse order.
