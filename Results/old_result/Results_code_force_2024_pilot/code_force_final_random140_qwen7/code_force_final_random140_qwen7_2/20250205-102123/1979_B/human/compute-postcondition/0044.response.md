Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, the elements at index `i` of lists `l1` and `l2` are equal.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The conditions and equality of the elements at index `i` of lists `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 also remains valid.
