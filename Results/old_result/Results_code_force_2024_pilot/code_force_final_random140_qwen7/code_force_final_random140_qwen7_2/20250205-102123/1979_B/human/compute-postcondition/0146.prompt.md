Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero. After the loop executes three times, `x` becomes 0.25, which is then floored to 0 in integer division. Therefore, the loop terminates. The list `l1` contains the binary digits of the original value of `x` (when `x` was an integer), read from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. Since `x` was initially some integer value, after three iterations, `l1` will contain the last three bits of that integer. If `x` was an integer like 6 (binary 110), `l1` would be `[0, 1, 1]`. However, based on the given outputs, `l1` is `[1, 0, 0]`, indicating the last three bits of `x` were 001. Thus, the final value of `x` is 0, and `l1` is `[1, 0, 0]`.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is non-zero, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2]`, `y` is `y // 2`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is an odd number, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[1]`, `y` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[1, 1]`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
