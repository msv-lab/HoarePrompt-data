Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is 1; `cnt` is 1; `t` must be greater than 0; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0, 0];` the length of `l2` is not less than the length of `l1`. The length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `l1`, changing its contents from `[1, 0, 0]` to `[1, 0, 0, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
