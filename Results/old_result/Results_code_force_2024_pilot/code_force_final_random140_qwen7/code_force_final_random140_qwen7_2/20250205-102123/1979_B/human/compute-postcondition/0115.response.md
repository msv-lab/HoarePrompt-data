Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 1

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is 1, the condition `i < n` is false.

Since the condition `i < n` is false, the loop will not execute again because `i` is already equal to `n`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time since it won't run due to the current values of `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1**
