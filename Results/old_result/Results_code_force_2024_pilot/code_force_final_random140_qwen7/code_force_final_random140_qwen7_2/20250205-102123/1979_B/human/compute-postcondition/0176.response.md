Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
3. **Loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
4. **Next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the problem does not specify any change to `n` within the loop.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
