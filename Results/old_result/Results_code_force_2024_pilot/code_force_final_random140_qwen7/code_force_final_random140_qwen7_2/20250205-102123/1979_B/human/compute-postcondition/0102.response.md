Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - The variable `n` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `t` is 1 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `x` is 0 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `y` is 0 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `l1` is [0] (not relevant for the loop).
   - `l2` is [0] (not relevant for the loop).
   - `n` is 1 (satisfies the condition for the loop to execute).
   - `cnt` is 0 (not relevant for the loop).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `n` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 1**
