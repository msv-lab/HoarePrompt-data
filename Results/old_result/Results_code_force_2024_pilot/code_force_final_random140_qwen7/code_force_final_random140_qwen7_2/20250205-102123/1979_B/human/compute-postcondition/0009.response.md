Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2` updated with the new value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `x`. This operation does not affect `t`, `y`, or `l1`. The list `l1` is updated to include the new value of `x % 2` after `x` has been halved.
