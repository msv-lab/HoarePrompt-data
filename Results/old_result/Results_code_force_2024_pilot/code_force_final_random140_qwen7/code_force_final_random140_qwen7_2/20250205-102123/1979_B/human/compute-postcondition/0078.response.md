Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is halved (non-zero), `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the new `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value of the new `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` must be non-zero, after division, `y` remains non-zero. The binary digits of `y` in reverse order are stored in `l1`, and the value of `y % 2` is stored in `l2`. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged.
