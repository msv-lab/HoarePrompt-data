Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` must be non-zero, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` is non-zero, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `x` remains non-zero, `y` remains an input integer, and `l2` remains an empty list.
