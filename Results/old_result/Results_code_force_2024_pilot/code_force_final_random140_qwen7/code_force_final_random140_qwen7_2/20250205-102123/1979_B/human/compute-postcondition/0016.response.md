Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the value of `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `y` is non-zero, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1. However, without knowing the exact value of `y`, we cannot specify the exact value of `y % 2`. Therefore, `l2` now contains the value of `y % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
