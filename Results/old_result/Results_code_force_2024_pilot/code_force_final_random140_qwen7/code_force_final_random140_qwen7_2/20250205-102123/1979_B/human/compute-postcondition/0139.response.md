Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while y:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `y` is non-zero.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 1
   - `cnt` is 1
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `x` is 0
   - `y` is non-zero (but we need to know the exact value to proceed)
   - `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`
   - `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2]`
   - `y` is updated to `y // 2` at the end of each iteration

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends solely on the variable `y`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be non-zero.

Given that `y` is non-zero at the end of the previous iteration and it is updated to `y // 2` at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that `y` remains non-zero for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `y` is non-zero now, we need to ensure that `y` remains non-zero after the update `y = y // 2`.
   - For `y` to remain non-zero after the division, `y` must be an odd number (since even numbers would become zero after integer division by 2).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `y` must be an odd number.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` must be an odd number, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2]`**
