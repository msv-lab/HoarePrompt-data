Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is non-zero, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2]`, `y` is `y // 2`**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` is non-zero, after executing this line, `y` will be `y // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
