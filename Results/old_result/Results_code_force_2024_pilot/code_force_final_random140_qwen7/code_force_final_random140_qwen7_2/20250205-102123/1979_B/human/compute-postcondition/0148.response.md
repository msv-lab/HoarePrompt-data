Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[1, 1, 0]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `l2`. Initially, `l2` contains `[1, 1]`. After appending `0`, `l2` becomes `[1, 1, 0]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
