Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is non-zero, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `y` is non-zero, `y % 2` can either be 0 or 1. However, without a specific value for `y`, we represent it as `[y % 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
