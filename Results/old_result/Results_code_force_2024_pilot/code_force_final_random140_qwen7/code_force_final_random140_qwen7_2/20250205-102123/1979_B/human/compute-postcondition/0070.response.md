Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is `x // 2 // 2`, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the result back to `x`. Initially, `x` is `x // 2`, which means `x` was already halved once. Now, it is halved again, making `x` equal to `x // 2 // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
