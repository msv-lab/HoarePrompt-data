Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` (in reverse order).

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero, and in each iteration, `x` is halved using integer division (`x //= 2`). However, since `x` starts as 0, it does not enter the loop, and remains 0 throughout. The loop for `y` will continue until `y` becomes 0. Each time through the loop, the least significant bit of `y` is appended to `l2`, and `y` is halved. Once `y` is completely reduced to 0, the loop terminates, and `l2` contains the binary representation of the original value of `y` in reverse order.
