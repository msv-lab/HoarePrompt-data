Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `l1` and `l2` are lists of integers with the same length, and there exists at least one index `i` where `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `n`, `l1`, or `l2`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state, except that we know the program has exited the loop or condition it was in.
