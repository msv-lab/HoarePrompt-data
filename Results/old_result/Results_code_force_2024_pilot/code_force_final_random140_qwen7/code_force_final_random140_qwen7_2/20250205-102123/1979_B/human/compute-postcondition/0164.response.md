Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 1.
   - `n` is the length of `l2`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to 1, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (because if `n` is 1 or less, `i < n` will never be true).
   - The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is already set to 1.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `i` should be 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**.
