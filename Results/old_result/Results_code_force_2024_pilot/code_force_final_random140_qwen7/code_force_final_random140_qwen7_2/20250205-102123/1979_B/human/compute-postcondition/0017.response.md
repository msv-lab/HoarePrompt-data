Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is now half of its original value, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` (in reverse order), `l2` is a list containing the value of (`y` // 2) % 2.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `y`. Since `y` must be non-zero initially, after executing this line, `y` will be half of its original value. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `l1`, `l2`) remain unchanged.
