Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2` appended with the new value of `x % 2`**.

Explanation: The code appends the new value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, and `t` remains greater than 0. The value of `y` remains unchanged as it was obtained from input.
