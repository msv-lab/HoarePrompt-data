Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is 1
   - The postcondition states that if `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is 1, the loop will execute once because the condition `i < n` (0 < 1) is true.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Post-Iteration States:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` will remain 1.
   - The postcondition will be checked again for the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1**
