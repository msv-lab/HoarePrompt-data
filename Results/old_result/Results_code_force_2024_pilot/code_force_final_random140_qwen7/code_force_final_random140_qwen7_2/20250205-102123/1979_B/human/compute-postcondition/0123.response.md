Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial values of `i`, `n`, `cnt`, and `t` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are set to the integers entered by the user.
