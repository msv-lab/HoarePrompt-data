Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, this condition remains valid after the code execution. The other variables (`x` and `y`) are not mentioned in the code snippet and thus remain unaffected.
