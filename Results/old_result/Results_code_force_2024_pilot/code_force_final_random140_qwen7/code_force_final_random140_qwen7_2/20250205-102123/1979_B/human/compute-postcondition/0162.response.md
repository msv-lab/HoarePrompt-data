Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of `l2`, `cnt` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing `[1, 0, 0]`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, and `l1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
