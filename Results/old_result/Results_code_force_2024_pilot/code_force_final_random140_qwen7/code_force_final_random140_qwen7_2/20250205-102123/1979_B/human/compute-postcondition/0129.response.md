Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` must be non-zero, `y` is an input integer, `l1` is a list containing `[0]`, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `l1.append(x % 2)` appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (which is `x % 2`) to the list `l1`. Since `x` is non-zero, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1. However, without a specific value for `x`, we represent it as `0` (since no specific value was given, and typically, the modulo operation with an unspecified non-zero number starting from 0 would yield 0). Thus, `l1` now contains `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
