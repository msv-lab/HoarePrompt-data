Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is halved (non-zero), `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the new `y` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value of the new `y % 2`, and `l2` now contains the value of `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `y` is halved and remains non-zero, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `y` is even or odd. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `l1`) remain unchanged.
