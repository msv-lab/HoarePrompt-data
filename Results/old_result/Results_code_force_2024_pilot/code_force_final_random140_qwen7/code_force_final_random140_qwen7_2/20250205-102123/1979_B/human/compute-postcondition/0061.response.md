Based on the initial state described, we know that:

- `i` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each index `i` where `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`.
- The loop either continues until all elements are checked or breaks if there is a mismatch.

Since the loop has completed all iterations, it means that for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the elements `l1[i]` and `l2[i]` were equal, causing `cnt` to be incremented for each such match.

Therefore, `cnt` represents the number of indices where the corresponding elements in `l1` and `l2` are equal.

The print statement `print(2 ** cnt)` will then print \(2\) raised to the power of `cnt`.

Output: **2 ** cnt (where cnt is the number of indices where l1[i] equals l2[i])**
