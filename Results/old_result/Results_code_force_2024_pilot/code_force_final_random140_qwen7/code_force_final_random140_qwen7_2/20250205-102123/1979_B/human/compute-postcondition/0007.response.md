The loop condition is `x`, so the loop can execute again if `x` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is now `x // 2`, and `t` is greater than 0. The value of `x` being non-zero is the only condition we need to ensure for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `x` is now `x // 2`, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 0. Given that `x` is already `x // 2`, the only state we need to adjust is ensuring that `x` is still non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is now `x // 2` and `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is an integer from input, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list**
