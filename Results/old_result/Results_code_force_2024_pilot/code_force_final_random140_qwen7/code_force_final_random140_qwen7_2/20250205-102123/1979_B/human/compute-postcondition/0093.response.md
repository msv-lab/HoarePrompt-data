Postcondition: `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `l2` is a list containing all binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, and the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` will have an extra 0 appended to it.
