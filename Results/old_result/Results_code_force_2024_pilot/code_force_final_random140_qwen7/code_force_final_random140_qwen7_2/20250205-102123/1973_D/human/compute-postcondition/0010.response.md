Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it calls another function `func_3()` to process the values of `n` and `k`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `t` (representing the number of test cases) remains greater than 0.**
