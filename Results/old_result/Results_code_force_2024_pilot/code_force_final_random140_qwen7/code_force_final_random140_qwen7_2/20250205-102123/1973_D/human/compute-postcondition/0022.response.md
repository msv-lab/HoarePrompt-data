Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n // k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `n // k`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `n // k`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0. Therefore, `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Check the given initial state**: We know that `max_val` is `n`, and `k` is an input integer. However, these variables are not directly involved in the loop head. The only relevant variable from the loop head is `i`, which should be initialized to `n // k`.

5. **Ensure the loop can start**: For the loop to start, `i` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is initialized to `n // k`, we need to ensure that `n // k > 0`.

Given that `n` must be at least 1, `n // k` will be at least 1 if `k` is 1 or more. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n // k` is greater than 0.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be initialized to `n // k`.
- `i` must be greater than 0.

Putting this together, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0**
