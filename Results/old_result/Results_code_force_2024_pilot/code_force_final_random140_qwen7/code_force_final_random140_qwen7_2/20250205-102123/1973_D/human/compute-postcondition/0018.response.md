Output State: **`max_val` is `n - 1`, `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`, `i` is `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional was specified, we assume it breaks out of an implied loop or condition. All other variables retain their initial or calculated states.
