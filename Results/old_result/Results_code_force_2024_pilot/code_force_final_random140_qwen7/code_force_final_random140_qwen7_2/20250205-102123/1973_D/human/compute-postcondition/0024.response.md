Output State: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0; `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `n // k` and must be greater than 0, and `m` is still `i * max_val`.
