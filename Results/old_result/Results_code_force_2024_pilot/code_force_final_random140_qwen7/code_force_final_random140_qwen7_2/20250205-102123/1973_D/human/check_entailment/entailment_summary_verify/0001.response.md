### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified issues with the implementation of the splitting logic in `func_3()`. Let's re-evaluate the function `func_3()` in detail to confirm the issues and propose a corrected version.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The inner loop in `func_3()` attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product `m = i * max_val`.
   - The variable `p` is used to track the current position in the array, but the logic to ensure that each subarray has the correct product `m` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if p >= n` and the subsequent reset of `p` might not correctly handle the splitting process.

2. **Missing Validation**:
   - There is no validation to ensure that the subarrays are correctly formed and meet the product requirement `m`.

#### Corrected Implementation

To correctly implement the splitting logic, we need to ensure that each subarray is validated to have the correct product `m`. Here's a revised version of `func_3()`:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        r = func_1(1, i * n)
        if r <= n:
            assert r == n
            max_val = i
            break
    assert max_val > 0

    # Try to find the largest m such that the array can be split into k subarrays
    for m in range(max_val * n, 0, -1):
        p = 0
        count = 0
        while p < n:
            r = func_1(p + 1, m)
            if r > n:
                break
            p = r
            count += 1
            if count == k:
                func_2(m)
                return
        if count == k:
            func_2(m)
            return
    func_2(-1)
```

#### Explanation

1. **Finding `max_val`**:
   - The code correctly finds the maximum value `max_val` such that `f(1, r) = max_val * n` for some `r`.

2. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The code iterates from `max_val * n` down to 1 to find the largest possible `m`.
   - For each potential `m`, it uses a while loop to try to split the array into `k` subarrays.
   - The variable `p` tracks the current position in the array, and `count` keeps track of the number of subarrays formed.
   - If `count` reaches `k`, the function prints the answer `m` and returns.

3. **Validation**:
   - The code ensures that each subarray has the correct product `m` by validating the position `r` returned by `func_1()`.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the corrected implementation, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the splitting logic. The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic, and the corrected version addresses these issues.

Final: **False**
