Postcondition: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, where in both cases (`p >= n` and `p < n`), the final values of the variables are as specified in the if part since the else part does not provide any additional conditions or changes.
