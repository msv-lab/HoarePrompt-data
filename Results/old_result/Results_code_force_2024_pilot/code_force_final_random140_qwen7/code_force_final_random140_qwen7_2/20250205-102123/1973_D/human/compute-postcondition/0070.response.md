Output State: `p` is now the result of applying `func_1` to its argument `p + 1` a total of `k` times, starting with `p` being `0`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k`, and `k` is the same as before.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `p` will have the value obtained by repeatedly applying the function `func_1` to `p + 1`, starting from `p = 0`, a total of `k` times. The variable `j` will be equal to `k` since it increments by `1` in each iteration of the loop, and `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
