Output State: **`i` is `n // k`, and `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` must be a positive integer, the current value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified within the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only effect of the `break` statement is to indicate that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
