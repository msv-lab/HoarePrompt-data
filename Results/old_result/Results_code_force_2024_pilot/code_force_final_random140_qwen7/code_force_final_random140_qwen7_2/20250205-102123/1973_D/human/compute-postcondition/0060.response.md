Output State: **`p` is 0, `n` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `k` is the same as before**.

Explanation: The value of `p` is explicitly set to 0. The values of `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. `n` is still an integer, `j` is still `j_prev + 1`, and `k` remains the same as before.
