Output State: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `p = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`. All other variables (`i`, `m`, `j`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The function call `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` is not executed because `p` is reassigned to 0 immediately, and the function call is not part of the current scope. Therefore, the precondition that `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` is no longer valid. The only change is that `p` is now 0.
