### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Purpose:**
   - `func_1(l, x)`: This function asks the judge for the smallest integer \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \).
   - `func_2(m)`: This function outputs the answer \( m \) to the judge and checks if the answer is correct.
   - `func_3()`: This function attempts to find the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and maximum value equals \( m \). If no such \( m \) exists, it outputs -1.
   - `func_4()`: This function processes multiple test cases, calling `func_3()` for each.

2. **Logic Analysis:**
   - In `func_3()`, the algorithm starts by finding the maximum value \( i \) such that \( f(1, i \cdot n) \leq n \). This ensures that the initial maximum value is valid.
   - Then, it tries to find the largest possible \( m \) by iterating over potential values of \( m \) derived from \( i \) and checking if the subarrays can be formed with the required product.
   - The logic for forming subarrays is sound and follows the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The code handles the edge case where no valid \( m \) exists by returning -1.
   - The code respects the constraints \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and \( 1 \leq l \leq n \), \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 \).

4. **Interaction Protocol Compliance:**
   - The code correctly prints queries and waits for responses.
   - It flushes the output after each query to ensure timely responses.
   - The code handles the judge's feedback appropriately by terminating upon receiving -1.

5. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The code iterates over all test cases and processes each one independently.
   - It correctly handles the termination condition for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as per the provided specifications and constraints. There are no apparent logical errors or violations of the problem statement.

### Correctness:
