Output State: **`p` is now `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m) + 1, m)`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `k` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Since `p` was initially `func_1(p + 1, m)`, the new value of `p` becomes `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m) + 1, m)`. The values of `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but since the exact value of `p` is not given, we cannot determine if the break condition is met.
