Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` must be greater than 0.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for _ in range(t):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `t` as the condition for the loop to continue.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop continues based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

### Conclusion
The state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is still greater than 0.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
