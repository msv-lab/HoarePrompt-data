Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the user, where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \). It then iterates through values to find a maximum value \( max_val \) such that a certain condition involving \( r \) (calculated using `func_1`) is met. If no such \( max_val \) is found, it proceeds to another loop where it calculates \( m \) and \( p \) using \( max_val \) and \( k \), and calls `func_2` with \( m \) if a specific condition is satisfied. Otherwise, it calls `func_2` with \(-1\). The function can return a value equal to \( n \), return `None`, or not return any value based on the conditions met during its execution.**
