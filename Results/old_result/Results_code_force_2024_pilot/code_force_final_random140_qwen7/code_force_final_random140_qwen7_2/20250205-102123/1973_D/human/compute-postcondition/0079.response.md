Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to `k`.
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `k + 1`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < k + 1`.

4. **Initial values**:
   - `m = i * max_val`
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `j = k`
   - `k` is the same as before.
   - `p = 0`
   - `i = n // k - 1`

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = k`, the loop will run as long as `j < k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `k + 1`. Given that `j` starts at `k`, the loop will run exactly once (since `j` will increment from `k` to `k + 1`).

6. **Final state after the loop**:
   - After the loop, `j` will be `k + 1`, which is not less than `k + 1`, so the loop will terminate.

7. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `j` must be `k` initially.
   - `k` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop runs at least once.

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k`, `k` must be a positive integer, `p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`**
