State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution. The key variable here is `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because the `range(t)` function will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or less, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
