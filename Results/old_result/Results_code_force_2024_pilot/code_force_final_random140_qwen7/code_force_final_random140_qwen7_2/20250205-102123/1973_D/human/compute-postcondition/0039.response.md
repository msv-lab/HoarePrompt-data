Output State: **`i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `m`, `p`, `j` remain unchanged, and the condition that `i` must be greater than 0 also remains valid.
