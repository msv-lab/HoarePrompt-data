Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement that was being executed. None of the variables are modified by this statement, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
