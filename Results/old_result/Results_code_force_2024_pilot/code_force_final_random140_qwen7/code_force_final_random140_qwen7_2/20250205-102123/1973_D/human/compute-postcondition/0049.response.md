Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n // k`
- `i` must be greater than 0
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `p` is the result of applying the function `func_1` repeatedly `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using the value of `m` each time
- `j` is `k`
- `p` is not equal to `n`

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n // k` down to `1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since the loop runs in reverse, the new value of `i` will be `i - 1`.
2. **Adjust Other Variables**: The other variables (`m`, `p`, `j`, and the condition `p != n`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `i` will be `i - 1`
- `i` must still be greater than 0
- `m` remains `i * max_val`
- `p` remains the result of applying the function `func_1` repeatedly `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using the value of `m` each time
- `j` remains `k`
- `p` remains not equal to `n`

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `n // k - 1`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, `p` is the result of applying the function `func_1` repeatedly `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using the value of `m` each time, `j` is `k`, `p` is not equal to `n`**
