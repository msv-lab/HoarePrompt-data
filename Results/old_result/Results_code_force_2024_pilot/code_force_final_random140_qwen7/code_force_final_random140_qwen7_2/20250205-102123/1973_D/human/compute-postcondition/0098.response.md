Output State: `m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k + 3`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k + 3` (since it increments `j` by 1 each time and starts at 1). After 3 iterations, `j` becomes `k + 3`. The value of `p` remains `func_1(p + 1, m)` because the condition `p >= n` never evaluates to `True` within these iterations, so the `break` statement is never reached. The other variables (`m`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
