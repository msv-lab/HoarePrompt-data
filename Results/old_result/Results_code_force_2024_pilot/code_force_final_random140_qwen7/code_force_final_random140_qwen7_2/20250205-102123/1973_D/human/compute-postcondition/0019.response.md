Postcondition: `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n) <= n`, `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `r <= n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `r > n`, no specific change is made to `max_val`.
