Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j_prev + 1`.
   - `k` remains the same as before.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `k + 1`.

4. **Update the values based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `j` is `j_prev + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 again.
   - Therefore, `j` becomes `j_prev + 2`.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `p` is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `n` is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `j` is updated to `j_prev + 2`.
   - `k` remains the same as before.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`p` is now `func_1(func_1(p + 1, m) + 1, m)`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, `k` is the same as before**
