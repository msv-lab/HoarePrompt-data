Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `max_val` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    r = func_1(1, i * n)
    if r <= n:
        assert r == n
        max_val = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n) <= n`. `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, and `r` is the result of `func_1(1, i * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, `max_val` is updated accordingly. If `r` is greater than `n`, no update is made to `max_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n) <= n`, `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, i * n)`. If `r <= n`, `max_val` is assigned the value of `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `r > n`, no change is made to `max_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max_val` is `n - 1`, `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`, if `r <= n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
