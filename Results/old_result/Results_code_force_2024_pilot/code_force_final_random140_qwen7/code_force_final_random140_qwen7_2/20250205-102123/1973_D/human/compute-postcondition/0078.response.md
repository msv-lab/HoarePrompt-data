Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `k`, `k` is the same as before, `p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`**.

Explanation: The line `p = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`. All other variables (`m`, `n`, `j`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
