Output State: **`max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n) <= n`, `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, i * n)`, `i` is `n - 1`, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `func_1(1, i * n)` to `r`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, `r` becomes `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
