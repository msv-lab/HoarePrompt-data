Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. All other variables remain in their initial state, meaning they are not defined or their values are unspecified until further input or assignments occur.
