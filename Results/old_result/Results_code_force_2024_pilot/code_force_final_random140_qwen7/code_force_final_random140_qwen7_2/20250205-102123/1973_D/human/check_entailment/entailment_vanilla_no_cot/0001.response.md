Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Loop:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case.
   - It correctly reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value `mx`:**
   - The loop `while True:` is used to find the maximum value `mx` such that `f(1, n) = n * mx`.
   - This is done by incrementally increasing `mx` until the condition `x == n` is met, which means the maximum value found is `mx`.

3. **Setting the Target Value `tar`:**
   - The target value `tar` is set to `n // k * mx`. This is the initial guess for the value `m` that needs to be split into `k` subarrays.

4. **Binary Search for `tar`:**
   - The code uses a while loop to adjust `tar` by decrementing it by `mx` until a valid `tar` is found.
   - The function `func_1(tar, k, n)` is called to check if the current `tar` can be split into `k` subarrays.

5. **Checking Subarray Validity:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the array and checks if the subarrays can be formed with the product of their length and maximum being `tar`.
   - If a valid split is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

6. **Outputting the Result:**
   - If a valid `tar` is found, it prints `! tar` and waits for the judge's response.
   - If the response is `-1`, the program exits.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Finding `mx`:**
   - The logic to find `mx` is correct. It increments `mx` until the maximum value `f(1, n)` is found.

2. **Setting `tar`:**
   - The initial guess `tar = n // k * mx` is reasonable, but it might not always be the optimal value. However, the binary search ensures that the correct value is found.

3. **Binary Search for `tar`:**
   - The binary search approach is sound. It adjusts `tar` by decrementing it by `mx` until a valid `tar` is found. This ensures that the largest possible `m` is found.

4. **Checking Subarray Validity:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the subarrays can be formed with the product of their length and maximum being `tar`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The output handling is correct. It prints the result and waits for the judge's response.

### Conclusion

The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It finds the largest value `m` that can be split into `k` subarrays and handles the interactions with the judge appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
