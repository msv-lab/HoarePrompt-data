Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `k`, `k` is the same as before, `p` is the result of applying `func_1` repeatedly `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using `m` as the second argument each time, `i` is `n // k - 1`**.

This means that the value of `m` is updated to `i * max_val`, while the other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
