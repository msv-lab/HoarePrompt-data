Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we keep `p` as `func_1(p + 1, m)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
