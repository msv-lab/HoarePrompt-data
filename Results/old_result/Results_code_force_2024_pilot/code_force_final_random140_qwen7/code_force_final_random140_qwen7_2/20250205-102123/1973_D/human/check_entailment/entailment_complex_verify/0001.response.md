### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Key Points to Check

1. **Finding `max_val`**:
   - The code correctly finds the maximum value `max_val` such that `f(1, r) = max_val * n` for some `r`.

2. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The logic to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product `m = i * max_val` needs careful examination.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_3()`

1. **Finding `max_val`**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       r = func_1(1, i * n)
       if r <= n:
           assert r == n
           max_val = i
           break
   ```
   - This loop correctly identifies the maximum value `max_val` such that `f(1, r) = max_val * n` for some `r`.

2. **Splitting the Array**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
       m = i * max_val
       p = 0
       for j in range(1, k + 1):
           if p >= n:
               p = 0
               break
           p = func_1(p + 1, m)
       if p == n:
           func_2(m)
           return
   ```
   - The outer loop iterates from `n // k` down to 1, trying to find a suitable `m`.
   - The inner loop attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product `m = i * max_val`.
   - The variable `p` is used to track the current position in the array. However, the logic to ensure that each subarray has the correct product `m` is not clear.

#### Issues in the Splitting Logic

- **Incorrect Handling of Subarray Boundaries**:
  - The variable `p` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the inner loop, but it does not ensure that the subarray boundaries are correctly identified.
  - The condition `if p >= n` and the subsequent reset of `p` might not correctly handle the splitting process. Specifically, the function `func_1` is called with `p + 1`, which means it starts checking from the next element, but it does not guarantee that the subarray boundaries are correctly aligned.

- **Lack of Proper Validation**:
  - The inner loop does not validate that the subarray lengths and maximum values meet the required conditions. It simply checks if `p` reaches `n`, but it does not ensure that each subarray has the correct product `m`.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly split the array into `k` subarrays with the product `m = i * max_val`, the program should:
1. Identify the starting point of each subarray.
2. Ensure that each subarray has the correct product `m`.
3. Validate that the subarrays are correctly aligned and cover the entire array.

Given these issues, the current implementation is not sufficient to correctly split the array into `k` subarrays with the required product.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

End of Reasoning

Final: **False**
