Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is 0, `i` is `n // k - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional was specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we know the execution would break out of the implied loop or conditional. All other variables retain their initial states.
