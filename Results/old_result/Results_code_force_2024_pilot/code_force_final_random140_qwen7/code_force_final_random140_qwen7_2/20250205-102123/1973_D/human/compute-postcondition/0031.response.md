Output State: **`i` is `n // k`, and `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 1, `k` must be a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. The values of `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `p` is now dependent on the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
