Output State: `i` is `n // k`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `k` because the loop runs from `1` to `k`. The condition `if p >= n:` ensures that once `p` reaches or exceeds `n`, the loop breaks. Since the loop breaks when `j` is `k`, it means the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `i`, `m`, and `p` remain as they were updated within the loop but do not change further outside the loop.
