Output State: **`m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k + 3`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` equals `n`, and `func_2(m)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_2(m)` calls the function `func_2` with the argument `m`. However, since the function definitions for `func_1` and `func_2` are not provided, no changes are made to the variables `m`, `n`, `j`, `k`, `p`, or `i`. The value of `m` remains as `i * max_val`, and the value of `p` remains as `n`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `k`, and `i`) retain their initial states. The function call `func_2(m)` is noted but does not alter the values of the variables.
