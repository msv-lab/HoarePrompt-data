Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly formats and sends a query to the judge, waits for a response, and handles assertions to ensure the response is valid. This function is used to query the smallest integer `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly formats and sends the answer to the judge, waits for a response, and handles assertions to ensure the response is valid. This function is used to send the final answer for each test case.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is designed to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and maximum value equals `m`. Here's a breakdown of its logic:
   - It first determines the maximum value `max_val` such that `f(1, r) = max_val * n` for some `r`.
   - Then, it tries to find a value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and maximum value equals `m`.
   - If such an `m` is found, it sends the answer using `func_2`.
   - If no such `m` is found, it sends `-1` using `func_2`.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_3` for each test case. It ensures that the number of test cases `t` is handled correctly.

Given the problem statement and the execution summaries, the functions appear to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The logic in `func_3` seems to correctly implement the strategy to find the largest `m` for each test case, and `func_4` correctly processes multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
