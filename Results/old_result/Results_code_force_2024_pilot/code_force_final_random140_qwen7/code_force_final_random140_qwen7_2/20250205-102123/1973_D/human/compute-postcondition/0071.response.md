Output State: `p` is now the result of applying `func_1` repeatedly `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using `m` as the second argument each time, `n` is an integer, `j` is `k`, `k` is the same as before.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `p` will hold the value obtained by repeatedly applying the function `func_1` starting from `p + 1` and using `m` as the second argument for each of the `k` iterations. The variable `j` will be equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
