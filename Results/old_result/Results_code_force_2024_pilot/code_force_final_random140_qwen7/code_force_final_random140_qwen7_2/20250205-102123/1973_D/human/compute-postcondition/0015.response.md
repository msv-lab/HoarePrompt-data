Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `0`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n) <= n`.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `r` is the result of `func_1(1, i * n)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop runs in reverse order (from `n` to `0`), the next value of `i` would be `i - 1` (assuming `i` was previously `n`).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `max_val` and `r` remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes them, but since no specific action is mentioned for these variables outside the loop body, they stay the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `i` will be `n - 1` (since it decreases by 1 in each iteration).
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `max_val` and `r` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n) <= n`, `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, i * n)`, `i` is `n - 1`**.
