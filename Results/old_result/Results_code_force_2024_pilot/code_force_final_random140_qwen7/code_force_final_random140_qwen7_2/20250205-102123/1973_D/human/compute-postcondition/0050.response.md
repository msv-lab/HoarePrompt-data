Output State: **`i` is `n // k - 1`, `i` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of applying the function `func_1` repeatedly `k` times starting from `p + 1` and using the value of `m` each time, `j` is `k`, `p` is not equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` to `i * max_val`. The value of `i` remains `n // k - 1` and is still greater than 0. The value of `p` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the updated state of `m` is `i * max_val`, while the other variables retain their original conditions.
