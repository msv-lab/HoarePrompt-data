Output State: **`max_val` is assigned the value of `i`, `k` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, i * n)`.**

Explanation: The code `max_val = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `max_val`. The other variables (`k`, `n`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
