Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is a string consisting of the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice.
- `x` is the value of `n // 2`.
- `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2.

The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
