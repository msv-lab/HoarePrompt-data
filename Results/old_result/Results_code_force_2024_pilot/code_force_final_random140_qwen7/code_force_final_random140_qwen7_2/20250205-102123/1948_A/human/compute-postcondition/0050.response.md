Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. The initial conditions state that `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]` and `n` must be at least 2. After executing the code, `x` is increased by 1, but the specific value of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous state, and `n` still must be at least 2.
