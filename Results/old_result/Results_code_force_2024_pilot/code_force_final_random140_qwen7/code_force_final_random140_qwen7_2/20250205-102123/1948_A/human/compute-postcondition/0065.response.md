Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` by repeating each character from a predefined uppercase alphabet string `s` twice for `n // 2` times and then prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`. The function iterates `t` times, where `t` is the total number of test cases provided by the user.**
