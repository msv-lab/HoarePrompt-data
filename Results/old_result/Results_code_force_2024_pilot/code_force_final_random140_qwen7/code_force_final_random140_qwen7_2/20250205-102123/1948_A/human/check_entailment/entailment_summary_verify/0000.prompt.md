You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            (ans, x) = ('', 0)
            x = 0
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` by repeating each character from a predefined uppercase alphabet string `s` twice for `n // 2` times and then prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`. The function iterates `t` times, where `t` is the total number of test cases provided by the user.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as required. For example, consider `n = 6`. The program generates a string with a fixed pattern "AAABAACC", which has 6 special characters. However, this pattern is hardcoded and does not account for other possible valid strings that could satisfy the condition. For instance, a string like "ABACAD" also has 6 special characters but is not generated by the current implementation. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where `n` is odd, which is explicitly mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
