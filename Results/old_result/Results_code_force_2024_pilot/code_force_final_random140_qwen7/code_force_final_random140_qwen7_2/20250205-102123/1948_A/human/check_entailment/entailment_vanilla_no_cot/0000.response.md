Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Special Characters**: The program does not ensure that the special characters are placed such that each special character is exactly equal to one of its neighbors. For example, the string `AAABAACC` does not meet the criteria because it has more than one neighbor that is the same for some characters.

2. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly handle the output format. It prints 'NO' when `n` is odd, but it should also handle the case where no suitable string can be formed even if `n` is even.

3. **String Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the string is flawed. The current implementation constructs a string with pairs of different characters, which does not guarantee that each character will have exactly one neighbor that is the same.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is 1 or when no suitable string can be formed.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Construct a string with alternating characters
            half = ['A', 'B'] * (n // 2)
            ans = ''.join(half)
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

This solution checks if `n` is 1 or odd, in which case it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string with alternating characters 'A' and 'B', ensuring that each character has exactly one neighbor that is the same.
