You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            (ans, x) = ('', 0)
            x = 0
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` by repeating each character from a predefined uppercase alphabet string `s` twice for `n // 2` times and then prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`. The function iterates `t` times, where `t` is the total number of test cases provided by the user.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program imports `os` and `string`.
   - It clears the screen using `os.system('cls')`.
   - It initializes the string of uppercase Latin letters (`s`) and reads the number of test cases (`t`).

2. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

3. **Check for Special Characters:**
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd (as explained in the problem statement).
   - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Constructing the String:**
   - Initializes an empty string `ans` and a variable `x` to keep track of the current character.
   - Loops `n // 2` times to create pairs of characters.
   - Each pair consists of two different characters from the uppercase alphabet.
   - Adds these pairs to the `ans` string.
   - Increments `x` to move to the next character in the alphabet.

5. **Output:**
   - Prints "YES".
   - Prints the constructed string `ans`.

### Verification

- **Odd `n`:**
  - The program correctly identifies that it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd and prints "NO".

- **Even `n`:**
  - The program constructs a string where each character (except the first and last) is special.
  - The string has exactly `n` special characters.
  - The length of the string is `n + 1` (since it includes `n` special characters and one additional character to make the string length even).

### Example Verification

- **Test Case 1: `n = 6`**
  - The program constructs "AAABAACC", which has 6 special characters.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 2: `n = 1`**
  - The program correctly prints "NO" because 1 is odd.

- **Test Case 3: `n = 2`**
  - The program constructs "MM", which has 2 special characters.
  - This is correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` as per the problem statement. It constructs a valid string for even `n` and correctly reports "NO" for odd `n`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
