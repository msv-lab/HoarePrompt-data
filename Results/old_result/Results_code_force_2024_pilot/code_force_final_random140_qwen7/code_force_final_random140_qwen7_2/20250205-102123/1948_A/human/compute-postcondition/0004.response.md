Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` being at least 1 and `i` being 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be at least 1, `n` now holds the integer value of the user's input, and `i` must still be 0.
