Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code `os.system('cls')` is used to clear the command line or terminal screen. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `t` and `n`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged, and the conditions they satisfy also remain the same.
