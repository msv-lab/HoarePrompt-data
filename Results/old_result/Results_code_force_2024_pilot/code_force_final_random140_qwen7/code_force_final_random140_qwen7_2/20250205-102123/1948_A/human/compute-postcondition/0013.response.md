Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n // 2)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`.
   - `x` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be one less than the number of iterations completed so far.
   - Since `j` starts from 0, if `j` is currently `k`, then the loop has completed `k + 1` iterations.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `k + 1`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since the loop is based on `j` and `n`, and no information about `n` changing is provided, `n` remains the same.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `n` remains the same**.

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `j` and `n`.

State: **`j` is 0 (if it was previously 0), `n` remains the same**.

If `j` was previously `k`, then for the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `n` remains the same**.

Since we are only focusing on the loop head variables, the answer is:

State: **`j` is increased by 1, and `n` remains the same**.
