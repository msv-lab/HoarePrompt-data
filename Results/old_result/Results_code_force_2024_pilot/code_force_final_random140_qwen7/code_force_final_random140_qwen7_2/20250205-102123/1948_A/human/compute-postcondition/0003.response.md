State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for i in range(t):` means that the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `t` is less than 1, the loop will not execute at all.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
4. The variable `n` is not directly used in the loop condition but could be relevant within the loop body. However, since no specific action involving `n` is mentioned in the loop head, we do not need to adjust its value specifically for the loop to start.

Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `t` and `i`. Since `i` is set to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, we can state that `i` must be 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` must be 0**
