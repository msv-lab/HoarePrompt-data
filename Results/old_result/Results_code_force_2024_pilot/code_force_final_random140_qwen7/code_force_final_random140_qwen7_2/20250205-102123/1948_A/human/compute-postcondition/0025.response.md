Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `n` is converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged, and the new value of `n` is the integer representation of the input provided by the user.
