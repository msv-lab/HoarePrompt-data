Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(n // 2):`. The loop variable here is `j`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is 'ss'
   - `x` is 2
   - `t` must be at least 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `j` is 2

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(n // 2)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `n // 2` must be greater than 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 5 (since `n // 2` would then be 2 or more).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `ans` remains 'ss'
   - `x` remains 2
   - `t` remains at least 1
   - `i` remains 2
   - `n` must now be at least 5
   - `j` must be 3 for the loop to execute again

Thus, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`ans` is 'ss', `x` is 2, `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `j` is 3**
