Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]` for each iteration from 0 to n//2 - 1, and `x` is increased by 1 for each iteration.**

In more detail, `ans` will be the concatenation of `s[x] * 2` for every `j` in the range of `n // 2`. The variable `x` will be incremented by 1 after each iteration of the loop. The variable `t` remains at least 1 as it was not modified within the loop, and `n` remains unchanged as well.
