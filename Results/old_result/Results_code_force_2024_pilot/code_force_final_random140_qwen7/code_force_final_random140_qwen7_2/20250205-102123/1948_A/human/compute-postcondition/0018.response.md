Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]` plus its previous value, `j` is increased by 4, `x` is increased by 1, and `n` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
