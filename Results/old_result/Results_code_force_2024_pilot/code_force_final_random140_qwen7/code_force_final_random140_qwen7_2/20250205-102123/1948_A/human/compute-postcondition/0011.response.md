Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, and `x` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` increments the value of `ans` by twice the value of `s[x]`. The value of `x` is not modified by this operation, so it remains unchanged. The initial state does not provide specific values for `ans` and `s[x]`, so we only know that `ans` is increased by `2 * s[x]`.
