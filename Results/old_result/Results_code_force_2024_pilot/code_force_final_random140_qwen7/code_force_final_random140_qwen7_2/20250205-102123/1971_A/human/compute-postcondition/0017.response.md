Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is converted to an integer from the input, `b` is converted to an integer from the input.**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts each to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and the initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, but now `a` and `b` hold the integer values from the input.
