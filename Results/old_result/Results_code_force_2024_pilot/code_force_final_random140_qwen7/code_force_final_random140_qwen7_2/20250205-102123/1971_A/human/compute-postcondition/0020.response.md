Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a` is converted to an integer from the input.
- `b` is converted to an integer from the input.

The `print(b, a)` statement will print the values of `b` and `a`.

Since both `a` and `b` are explicitly defined as input integers, their values will be the integers provided as inputs.

Output: **b, a**
