Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `a` is converted to an integer from the input.
   - `b` is converted to an integer from the input.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1, so for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is converted to an integer from the input, `b` is converted to an integer from the input**
