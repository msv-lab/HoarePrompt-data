You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    t = 0
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b:
            print(a, b)
        elif a == b:
            print(a, b)
        else:
            print(b, a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    t = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b:
            print(a, b)
        elif a == b:
            print(a, b)
        else:
            print(b, a)
        
    #State: The final output state will be as follows: `t` remains 0, `n` remains an input integer which must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers inputted during the loop. Regardless of the values of `a` and `b`, they are printed in ascending order if `a` is less than `b`, or in their original order if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates `n` times, reading pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the input.
3. For each pair `(a, b)`, it checks which of the two numbers is smaller and prints the smaller one followed by the larger one.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
- It correctly reads pairs of integers `(a, b)` for each test case.
- The logic inside the loop is designed to print the minimum value followed by the maximum value:
  - If `a < b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`.
  - If `a > b`, it prints `b` followed by `a`.
  - If `a == b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`.

This logic ensures that the minimum value is always printed first, followed by the maximum value, regardless of whether the values are equal or not.

### Example Walkthrough:

- For the input `1 9`, the program prints `1 9` because `1 < 9`.
- For the input `8 4`, the program prints `4 8` because `4 < 8`.
- For the input `1 4`, the program prints `1 4` because `1 < 4`.
- For the input `3 4`, the program prints `3 4` because `3 < 4`.
- For the input `2 0`, the program prints `0 2` because `0 < 2`.
- For the input `2 4`, the program prints `2 4` because `2 < 4`.
- For the input `6 9`, the program prints `6 9` because `6 < 9`.
- For the input `3 3`, the program prints `3 3` because `3 == 3`.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

The program is correct according to the problem description.
