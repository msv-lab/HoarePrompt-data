Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `a` is equal to `b`.

2. The `print(a, b)` statement will print the values of `a` and `b`.

3. From the initial state, we know that `a` and `b` are both input integers and they are equal to each other.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a` (or `b`) printed twice.

Output: **a a** (where `a` is the input integer and `b` is equal to `a`)
