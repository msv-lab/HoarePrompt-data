Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find and print the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers. Let's break it down:

1. The function `func()` reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates `n` times, reading two integers `a` and `b` for each test case.
3. For each pair `(a, b)`, it checks if `a` is less than `b`. If true, it prints `a` followed by `b`.
4. If `a` is equal to `b`, it still prints `a` followed by `b`.
5. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `b` followed by `a`.

This logic ensures that the output for each test case is the minimum value followed by the maximum value of the pair. The provided example in the execution summary matches this behavior.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
