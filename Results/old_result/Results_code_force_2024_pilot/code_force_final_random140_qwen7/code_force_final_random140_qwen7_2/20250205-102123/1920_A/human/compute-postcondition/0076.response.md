Output State: **`count_num` is 3, `i` is the third element in the list `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `count_num` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is referenced to the third element in the list `num`, and the precondition that `num` must have at least 3 elements is still valid.
