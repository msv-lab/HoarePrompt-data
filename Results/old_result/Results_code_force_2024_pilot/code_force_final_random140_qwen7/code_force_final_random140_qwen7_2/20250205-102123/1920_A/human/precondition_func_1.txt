t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of multiple lines as described in the problem statement. Each test case starts with an integer n followed by n lines describing the constraints. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
