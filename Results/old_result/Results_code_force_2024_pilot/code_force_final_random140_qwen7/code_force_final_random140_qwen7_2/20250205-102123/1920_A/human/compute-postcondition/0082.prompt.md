You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (t, x) are distinct.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` integers have been processed. For each integer `v` provided, if `t` is 1, `start` is updated to be the minimum value between `start` and `v`. If `t` is 2, `end` is updated to be the maximum value between `end` and `v`. If `t` is 3, `v` is appended to the list `num`. The variables `t` and `v` are reset to their initial values at the start of each iteration, and `i` increments with each iteration.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Postcondition: `count_num` is equal to the total number of elements in the list `num` that fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns `0`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns `0`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
