Output State: **`t` is 1, `v` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `start` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `v` is the second integer from the input, after appending, `num` will be a list containing this single element. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `start`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
