Output State: **Postcondition: `count_num` is equal to the total number of elements in the list `num` that fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `count_num` will hold the total count of elements from the list `num` that are within the specified range (`start` to `end`). If no elements in `num` fall within this range, `count_num` will remain 0. If all elements in `num` are within the range, `count_num` will be equal to the length of `num`.
