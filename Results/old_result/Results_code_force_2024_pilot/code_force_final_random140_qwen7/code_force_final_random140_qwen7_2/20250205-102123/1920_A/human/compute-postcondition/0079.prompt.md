Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `count_num` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `count_num` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `num`, and `num` must have at least one element. If `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `i` is within the range of `start` and `end`, `count_num` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `count_num` is 2, `i` is the second element in the list `num`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `count_num` is either 2 or 3, depending on whether `i` (which is the third element in the list `num`) is within the range defined by `start` and `end`. If `i` is outside this range, the loop continues with `count_num` remaining 2. If `i` is within the range, `count_num` is incremented to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
