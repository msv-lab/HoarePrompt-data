Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `count_num` is 0
   - `i` is the first element in the list `num`
   - `num` must have at least one element
   - If `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
   - If `i` is within the range of `start` and `end`, `count_num` is incremented by 1.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration:**
   - The loop continues if `i` is within the range of `start` and `end`.
   - If `i` is outside the range, the loop skips to the next iteration.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` is the first element in the list `num`, the next element in the list will be accessed in the next iteration.
   - If `i` is within the range of `start` and `end`, `count_num` will be incremented by 1.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `count_num` will be incremented by 1 if `i` is within the range of `start` and `end`.
- `i` will be the second element in the list `num`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`count_num` is 1 (if `i` was within the range), `i` is the second element in the list `num`, `num` must have at least two elements**.

If `i` was outside the range, the state would remain the same as the previous iteration, but since we are assuming it will continue to the next iteration, we assume `i` is within the range and `count_num` is incremented.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`count_num` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list `num`, `num` must have at least two elements**.
