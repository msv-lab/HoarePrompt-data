The function `func_6` takes a list of lists `arr`, an integer index, and an integer value as inputs. It searches through each sublist in `arr` to find the first sublist where the element at the specified `index` is not equal to `value`. If such a sublist is found, it is returned; otherwise, the function returns `None`.
