Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.**

The code assigns the value `1000000000` (which is the integer representation of 1000000000.0) to the variable `end`. The values of `n`, `t`, `x`, and `start` remain unchanged from their initial states.
