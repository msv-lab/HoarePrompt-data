Output State: **`n` is an integer input received such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9, and `start` is -1.**

The code sets `start` to -1, which does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `n`, `t`, and `x` from the initial state, while adding that `start` is now -1.
