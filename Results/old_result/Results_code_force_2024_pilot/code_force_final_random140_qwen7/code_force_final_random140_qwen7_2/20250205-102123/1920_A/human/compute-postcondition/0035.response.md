Output State: **`t` is 1, `v` is an integer input split and mapped to integers, `i` is 1, `end` is equal to `v`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `v` to the variable `end`. Since `v` is an integer input split and mapped to integers, `end` now holds the same value as `v`. The values of `t`, `i`, and the condition involving `start` remain unchanged.
