You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function processes a series of constraints involving integers and updates two variables, `start` and `end`, based on these constraints. It also collects integers into a list `num`. After processing, it counts how many integers in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. Finally, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus the count of integers within the range, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns `0`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and calculate the valid range for `k`. Specifically, the logic for updating `start` and `end` is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `start` and `end` are set to `-1` and `1000000000.0`, respectively. This means that any valid constraint will overwrite these values, but the initial values should be more meaningful.

2. **Constraint Handling**:
   - For `t == 1`, the program updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - For `t == 2`, the program updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.

3. **Exclusion of Specific Values**:
   - The program correctly excludes specific values (`num.append(v)`) but does not handle the case where these excluded values overlap with the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation `return end - start + 1 - count_num` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap between the excluded values and the range `[start, end]`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the following input:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

- Constraints:
  - `k >= 3`
  - `k <= 10`
  - `k != 1`
  - `k != 5`

- The program should correctly identify that `k` can be `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`, resulting in 7 valid values.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the range and excludes the wrong values, leading to an incorrect result.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, you should:
1. Initialize `start` to the maximum value from all constraints of type 1.
2. Initialize `end` to the minimum value from all constraints of type 2.
3. Remove the excluded values from the range `[start, end]`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = float('inf')
    end = -float('inf')
    excluded_values = set()

    for _ in range(n):
        t, v = map(int, input().split())
        if t == 1:
            start = min(start, v)
        elif t == 2:
            end = max(end, v)
        elif t == 3:
            excluded_values.add(v)

    # Calculate the valid range
    valid_range = max(0, end - start + 1 - len(excluded_values & set(range(start, end + 1))))
    return valid_range
```

This corrected function initializes `start` and `end` appropriately and correctly handles the exclusion of specific values within the range.
