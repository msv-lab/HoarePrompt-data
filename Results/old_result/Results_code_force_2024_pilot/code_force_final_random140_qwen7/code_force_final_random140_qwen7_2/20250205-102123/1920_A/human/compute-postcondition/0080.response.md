Output State: **The program returns `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns `0`.**

This means the program calculates the difference between `end` and `start` (inclusive) and subtracts the number of elements within that range (`count_num`). If `start` is greater than `end`, the program returns `0`.
