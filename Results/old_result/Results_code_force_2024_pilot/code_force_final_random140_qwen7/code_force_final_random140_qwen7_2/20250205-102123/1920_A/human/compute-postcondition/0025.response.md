Output State: **`t` is 1, `v` is an integer assigned from input split and mapped to integers, `num` is a list containing `v`.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `v` is an integer obtained from input, it is added to the list `num`. The other variables (`t` and the condition involving `start` and `end`) remain unchanged.
