Output State: **`t` and `v` are integers assigned the values from input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns these integers to `t` and `v`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we can only say that `t` and `v` are now integers derived from the input.
