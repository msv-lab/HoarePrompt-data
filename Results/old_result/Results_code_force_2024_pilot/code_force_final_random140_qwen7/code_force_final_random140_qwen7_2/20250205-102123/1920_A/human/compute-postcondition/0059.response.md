Output State: **`count_num` is 0**

The code initializes `count_num` to 0. There are no changes made to `start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, `v`, or `i` in the given snippet. The snippet only initializes `count_num` and does not perform any operations on the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `count_num` is set to 0.
