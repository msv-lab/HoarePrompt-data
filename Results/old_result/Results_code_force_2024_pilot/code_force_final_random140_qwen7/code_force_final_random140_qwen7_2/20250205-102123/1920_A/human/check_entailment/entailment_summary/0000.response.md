Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a series of constraints. These constraints are provided in the form of three types: \( k \geq x \), \( k \leq x \), and \( k \neq x \).
2. Function `func_7` is designed to process these constraints and compute the valid range for \( k \). It correctly initializes `start` and `end` to handle the bounds and collects values to exclude in the list `num`.
3. The logic inside `func_7`:
   - Updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and the lower bound \( x \) for constraints of type 1.
   - Updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and the upper bound \( x \) for constraints of type 2.
   - Collects values to exclude in the list `num` for constraints of type 3.
4. After processing all constraints, `func_7` counts how many values in `num` do not fall within the range `[start, end]` and adjusts the result accordingly.
5. The main program correctly iterates over test cases, calling `func_7` for each and printing the results.

Given the detailed execution summary and the correctness of the logic in `func_7`, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
