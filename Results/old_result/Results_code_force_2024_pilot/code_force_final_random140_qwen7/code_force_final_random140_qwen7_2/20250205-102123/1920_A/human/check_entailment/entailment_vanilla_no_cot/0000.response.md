Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a brief explanation of why:

- The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n`.
- It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1 billion (as per the constraints).
- For each constraint, it updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint (greater than or equal to, less than or equal to).
- It also collects all values that `k` should not be equal to in the `num` list.
- After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of invalid `k` values from the total range `[start, end]`.

The logic is sound and handles all the constraints as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
