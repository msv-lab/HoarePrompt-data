### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(isOne)`**: This function correctly handles the input based on the value of `isOne`. It returns an integer input if `isOne` is `False` and `1` if `isOne` is `True`. However, this function is not used in the main program logic, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

2. **Function `func_2(space, to_int)`**: This function reads input and processes it based on the parameters `space` and `to_int`. It is used to read the number of test cases (`t`) and the constraints for each test case. The logic here is correct and matches the problem requirements.

3. **Function `func_3(arr, sym)`**: This function converts a list of integers to a string with a specified separator. It is not used in the main program logic, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

4. **Function `func_4(string, substring)`**: This function finds all occurrences of a substring in a string. It is not used in the main program logic, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

5. **Function `func_5(arr, element)`**: This function returns the indices of a specific element in a list. It is not used in the main program logic, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

6. **Function `func_6(arr, index, value)`**: This function returns a sublist where the element at a specific index is not equal to a given value. It is not used in the main program logic, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

7. **Function `func_7()`**: This function correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It initializes `start` and `end` based on the constraints and updates them accordingly. It then counts the number of elements in `num` that do not fall within the range `[start, end]` and returns the correct number of valid integers.

Given that the main logic of the program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k`, and all functions are used appropriately, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
