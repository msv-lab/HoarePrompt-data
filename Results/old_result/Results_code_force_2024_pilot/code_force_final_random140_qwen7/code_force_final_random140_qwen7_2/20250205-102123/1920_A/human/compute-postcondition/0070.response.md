Output State: **`count_num` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list `num` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
