Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` integers have been processed. For each integer `v` provided, if `t` is 1, `start` is updated to be the minimum value between `start` and `v`. If `t` is 2, `end` is updated to be the maximum value between `end` and `v`. If `t` is 3, `v` is appended to the list `num`. The variables `t` and `v` are reset to their initial values at the start of each iteration, and `i` increments with each iteration.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `start` will hold the smallest value among all `v` where `t` was 1, `end` will hold the largest value among all `v` where `t` was 2, and `num` will contain all `v` where `t` was 3. The variables `t` and `v` will revert to their initial values before the loop started, and `i` will be equal to `n-1` since it increments at the end of each iteration but starts from 0.
