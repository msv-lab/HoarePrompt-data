Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in num`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `num`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `count_num` is 2.
   - `i` is the second element in the list `num`.
   - The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `i` is the second element in the list `num`, the next value of `i` would be the third element in the list `num`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `num` must still be a non-empty list, and it must have at least three elements because `i` is now the third element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` will be updated to the third element in the list `num`.
   - The list `num` must still exist and have at least three elements for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`count_num` is 2, `i` is the third element in the list `num`, and `num` must have at least 3 elements**.
