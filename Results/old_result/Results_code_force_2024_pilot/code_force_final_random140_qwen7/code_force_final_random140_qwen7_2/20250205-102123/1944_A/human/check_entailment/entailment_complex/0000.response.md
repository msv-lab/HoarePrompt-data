Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over each test case and determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). The logic within the function is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
3. It checks if \( n - k > 1 \):
   - If true, it prints \( n \), meaning Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.
   - If false, it prints 1, meaning Everule can only visit island 1.

This logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided. Specifically:
- If \( n - k > 1 \), it means there are enough bridges left for Everule to visit more than just island 1.
- If \( n - k \leq 1 \), it means there are not enough bridges left for Everule to visit any other island besides island 1.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the minimum number of islands Everule can visit for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
