Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as a positive integer within the specified range.
