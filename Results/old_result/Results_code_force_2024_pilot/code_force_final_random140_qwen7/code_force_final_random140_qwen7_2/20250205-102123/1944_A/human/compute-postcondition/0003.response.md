Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs via `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the user inputs a non-negative integer. The loop variable (which is `_` in this case) will increment with each iteration, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by the user's input, the only thing that changes is the number of iterations. However, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The next input from the user will determine how many more times the loop will execute.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `k` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer**.
