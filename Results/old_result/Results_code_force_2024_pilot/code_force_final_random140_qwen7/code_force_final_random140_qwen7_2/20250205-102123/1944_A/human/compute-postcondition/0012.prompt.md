You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k > 1 else 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have processed all input test cases. For each test case, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and the output will be `n` if `n - k > 1`, otherwise `1`. There is no specific value given for the final `new_input` as it is not defined in the provided loop, but it implies that after processing all inputs, there would be no further input to process.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, we will have processed all test cases. For each case, if `n - k` is greater than 1, the output will be `n`; otherwise, the output will be `1`. There are no further inputs to process after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The function checks if `n` is within the range 1 to 100 and if `k` is within the range 0 to (n * (n - 1)) / 2. If both conditions are met, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the combination (n, k) is valid based on the given constraints. If the conditions are not met, it returns an error message indicating the issue.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
