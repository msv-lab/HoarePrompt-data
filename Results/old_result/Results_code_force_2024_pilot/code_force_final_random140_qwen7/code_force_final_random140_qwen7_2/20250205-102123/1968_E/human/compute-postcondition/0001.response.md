State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^3, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the starting value of the `range` function, which is `0`.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must be greater than `0` (otherwise, the loop would not execute even once) and `t` must be within the given range of 1 to 50.
4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: Although `n` is not directly involved in the loop condition, it is mentioned in the problem statement and should be within its specified range.

Thus, the adjusted state is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^3, and `i` is 0.
