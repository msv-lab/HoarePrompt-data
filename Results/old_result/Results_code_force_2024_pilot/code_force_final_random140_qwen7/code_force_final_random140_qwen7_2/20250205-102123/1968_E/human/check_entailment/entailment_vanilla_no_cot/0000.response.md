Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Specifically, the program's approach is too rigid and does not consider all possible configurations that could maximize the Manhattan distances. For example, when \(n = 3\), the program outputs the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), but the optimal configuration should include \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) as shown in the problem statement. Similarly, for \(n \geq 4\), the program's approach is suboptimal and does not explore all possible configurations to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
