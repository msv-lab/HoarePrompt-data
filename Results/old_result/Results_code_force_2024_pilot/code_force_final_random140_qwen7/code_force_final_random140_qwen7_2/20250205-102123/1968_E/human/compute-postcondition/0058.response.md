Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 3, `j` is 16, `n` must be greater than 13.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be 16 (since it starts at 4 and increments by 1 each iteration), and `n` must still be greater than 13 for the loop to have completed all its iterations. The other variables (`t`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
