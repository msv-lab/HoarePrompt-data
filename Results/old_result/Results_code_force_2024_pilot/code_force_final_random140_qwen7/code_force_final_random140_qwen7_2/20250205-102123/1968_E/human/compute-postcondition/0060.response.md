Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 3, `j` is 16, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` will be incremented until it reaches 16, and `n` must be greater than 13 for the loop to complete. The variable `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
