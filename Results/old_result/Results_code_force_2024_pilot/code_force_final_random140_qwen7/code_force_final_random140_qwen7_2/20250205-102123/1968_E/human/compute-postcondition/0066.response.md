Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 3.
2. `n` is defined as being greater than 3, but its exact value is not specified.
3. The `print` statement only includes `i` and uses the `end=' '` parameter, which means it will print `i` followed by a space, but no newline character.

Given this information:

Output: **3 ** (where the space after 3 is due to the `end=' '` parameter)
