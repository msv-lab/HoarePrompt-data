Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and `n`. For each test case, it prints the values of `n`, `n-1`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n-1`. If `n` equals 3, it additionally prints 2 and 1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
