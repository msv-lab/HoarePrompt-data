Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` must be at least 5.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 5.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` expression concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`.
   - Since `j` is explicitly given as 5, the expression becomes `str(5) + ' ' + str(5)`, which results in `"5 5"`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the string `"5 5"`.

Output: **"5 5"**
