You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(4, n + 1)`. This means `j` should be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` is an input integer with a current value of at least 4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is not equal to 3.
   - `j` is 4.
   - `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 4 and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts at 4 and the loop increments it each time).
   - Therefore, `j` will become 5.
   - The condition `j <= n` must still hold true, so `n` must remain at least 5 (since `j` is now 5).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` must be at least 5.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` becomes 5.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 5, `i` is 1, `j` is 5**
```
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
