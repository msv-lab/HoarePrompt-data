Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(4, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 13.
   - `n` must be greater than 13.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(4, n + 1)`. This means `j` should be between 4 and `n` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 13.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to the next value within the range `4` to `n`.
   - Since `j` is currently 13, it needs to be incremented to 14 for the next iteration.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration because the loop condition depends on `n` and not on `j` alone.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `i` remains unchanged: `i` is 3.
   - `j` is incremented to 14.
   - `n` remains the same: `n` must be greater than 13.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 3, `j` is 14, `n` must be greater than 13**
