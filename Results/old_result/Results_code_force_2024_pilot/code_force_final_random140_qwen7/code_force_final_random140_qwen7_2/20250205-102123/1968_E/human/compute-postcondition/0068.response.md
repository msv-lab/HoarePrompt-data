Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 3.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` from 1 up to `n-2`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-2`, which is `n-1` since the loop runs from 1 to `n-2`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`. Additionally, for the loop to run `n-2` times (which is required for it to finish), `n` must be greater than 3.
