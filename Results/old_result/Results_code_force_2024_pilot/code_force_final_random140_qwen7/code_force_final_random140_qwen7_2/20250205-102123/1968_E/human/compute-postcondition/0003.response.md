The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is a value that must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is initialized to 0.

The `print('1 1')` statement simply prints the string `'1 1'`.

Given this information, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **1 1**
