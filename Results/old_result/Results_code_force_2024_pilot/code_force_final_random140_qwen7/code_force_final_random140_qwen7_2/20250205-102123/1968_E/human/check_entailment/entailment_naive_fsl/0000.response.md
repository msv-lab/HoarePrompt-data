Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:

```
1 1
1 2
2 3
```

However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should include three cells such that the Manhattan distances between them are maximized. A correct arrangement would be:

```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

This arrangement results in the set of Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3. The program's output for \(n = 3\) only includes two unique distances \(\{0, 2\}\), which has a size of 2. Therefore, the program fails to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\).
