Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` must be either 3 or at least 11.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 13.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because the loop condition depends on `i` and `t`, and we don't have information about how `t` changes inside the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `t` remains within the range of (0, 50].
   - `n` remains either 3 or at least 11.
   - `j` remains 13.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be either 3 or at least 11, `i` is 3, and `j` is 13**.
