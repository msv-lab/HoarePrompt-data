The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 8.

The `print('2 3')` statement simply prints the string `'2 3'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are not relevant to this particular print statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 3**
