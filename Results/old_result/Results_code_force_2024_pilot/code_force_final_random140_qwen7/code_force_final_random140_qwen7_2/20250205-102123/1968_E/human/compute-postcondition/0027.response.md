Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, and `j` is 8**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 8, `i` is 2, and `j` is 8 still holds true, but now `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user.
