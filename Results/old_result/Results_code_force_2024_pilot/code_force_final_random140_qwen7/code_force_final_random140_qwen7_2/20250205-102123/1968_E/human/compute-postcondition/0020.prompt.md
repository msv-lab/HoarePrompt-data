Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer with a current value of at least 4, `i` is 1, and `n` is not equal to 3
Code of the loop:
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer with a current value of at least 4, `i` is 1, `n` is not equal to 3, `j` is 4, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(4, n + 1)`. This means `j` should be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` is an input integer with a current value of at least 4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is not equal to 3.
   - `j` is 4.
   - `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 4 and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts at 4 and the loop increments it each time).
   - Therefore, `j` will become 5.
   - The condition `j <= n` must still hold true, so `n` must remain at least 5 (since `j` is now 5).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` must be at least 5.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` becomes 5.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 5, `i` is 1, `j` is 5**

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 5, `i` is 1, `j` is 5




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
