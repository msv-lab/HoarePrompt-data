Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 3, and `j` is 13, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. Since the input from `input()` is not specified, `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
