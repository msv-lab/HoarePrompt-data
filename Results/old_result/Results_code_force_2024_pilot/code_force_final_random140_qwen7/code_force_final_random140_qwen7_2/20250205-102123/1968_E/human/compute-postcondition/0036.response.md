Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 4 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` must be at least 8.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 9.

4. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the range 4 to `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently 9, it needs to be incremented by 1 to check the next value in the range.
   - Therefore, `j` should be 10 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is incremented to 10.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 8, `i` is 2, `j` is 10**
