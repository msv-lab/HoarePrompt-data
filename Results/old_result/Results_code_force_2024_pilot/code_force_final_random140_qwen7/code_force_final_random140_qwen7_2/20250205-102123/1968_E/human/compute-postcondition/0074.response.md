Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, t and n, where t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. The function returns a value based on the relationship between t and n.**

Note: Since the specific logic for processing t and n within the function body is not provided, the description focuses on the constraints and expected behavior based on the input parameters.
