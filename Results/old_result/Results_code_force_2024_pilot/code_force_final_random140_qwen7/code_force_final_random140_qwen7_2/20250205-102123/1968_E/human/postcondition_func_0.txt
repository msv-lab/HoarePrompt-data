The function processes multiple test cases defined by `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints specific pairs of numbers based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 3, it prints "2 3". If `n` is 4 or greater, it prints "2 4" followed by pairs of numbers from 4 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
