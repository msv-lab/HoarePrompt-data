Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The annotated program does not correctly generate the coordinates for all test cases. Specifically:
   - For \(n = 2\), the program prints only two points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), but the optimal solution should include at least three points to achieve the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). This is not the optimal solution as explained in the problem note.
   - For \(n \geq 4\), the program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then additional points from \((4, 4)\) to \((n, n)\). However, the optimal solutions involve different configurations to maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
