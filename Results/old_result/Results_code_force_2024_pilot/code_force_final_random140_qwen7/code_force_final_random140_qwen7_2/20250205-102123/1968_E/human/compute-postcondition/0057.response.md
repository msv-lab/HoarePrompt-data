Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 3, `j` is 16, `n` must be greater than 13.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations (until `j` exceeds `n`), the variable `t` remains within its initial bounds (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50), `i` remains unchanged at 3, `j` will be 16 (since it starts at 13 and increments by 1 each iteration, and the loop runs until `j` is no longer less than or equal to `n`), and `n` must remain greater than 13 for the loop to continue executing.
