Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two variables `bottom_v` and `top_v` initialized to 1 and `n` respectively.
   - It iterates through indices up to `k`, setting values in the `permutation` list in a specific pattern:
     - If the index is even, it assigns the current value of `bottom_v` to the corresponding position in the `permutation` list and increments `bottom_v`.
     - If the index is odd, it assigns the current value of `top_v` to the corresponding position in the `permutation` list and decrements `top_v`.
     - It then skips ahead by `k` positions to set the next batch of values.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and decrements `t` after processing each one.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The initialization of `bottom_v` and `top_v` ensures that the smallest and largest values are used alternately.
   - The loop structure ensures that every `k`-length segment of the permutation will have a mix of small and large values, which helps in maintaining the condition that any two sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The constructed permutation ensures that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be close to each other because the smallest and largest values are distributed evenly across the permutation.
   - Given that `k` is even and the values are alternated between the smallest and largest available values, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be at most 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that `k` is even and `k <= n`, so the logic should work for all valid inputs within the constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
