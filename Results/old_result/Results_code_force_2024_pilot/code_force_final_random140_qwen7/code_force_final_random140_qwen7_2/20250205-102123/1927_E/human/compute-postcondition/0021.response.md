Postcondition: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros. If `idx` is even, then `permutation[k]` is set to `2`. Otherwise, `permutation[k]` is set to `n`. Additionally, `n` and `k` are integers with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even, `bottom_v` is either 1 or 3, `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1`, `permutation[0]` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`, and `idx` is not even.**
