Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `idx` to the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. Since `idx` is less than `k` in the initial state, this relationship remains true. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is directly set to the current value of `idx`.
