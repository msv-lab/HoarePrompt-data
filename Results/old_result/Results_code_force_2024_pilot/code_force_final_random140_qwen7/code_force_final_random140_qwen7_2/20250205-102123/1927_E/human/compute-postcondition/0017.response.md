Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with `permutation[k]` equal to `2`, `n` and `k` are integers with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n`, `permutation[0]` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`, `idx` is not even**.

Explanation: The code updates the `permutation` list such that the element at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` (which is `k`) is set to `bottom_v` (which is 2). All other variables remain unchanged.
