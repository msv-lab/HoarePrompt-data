Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + k + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + k + 1`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v`, if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is equal to `top_v - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` to `bottom_v`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is defined as `idx + k + 1`, the value of `permutation[idx + k + 1]` is now `bottom_v`. The conditions regarding whether `idx` is even or odd no longer apply since the value has been explicitly set. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
