### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - It uses two pointers, `bottom_v` starting at 1 and `top_v` starting at `n`, to alternate between the smallest and largest values.
   - The loop iterates through indices up to `k`, setting values in the `permutation` list in a specific pattern:
     - If the index is even, it assigns the current value of `bottom_v` to the corresponding position in the `permutation` list and increments `bottom_v`.
     - If the index is odd, it assigns the current value of `top_v` to the corresponding position in the `permutation` list and decrements `top_v`.
     - It then skips ahead by `k` positions to set the next batch of values.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The constructed permutation ensures that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be close to each other because the smallest and largest values are distributed evenly across the permutation.
   - Since `k` is even and the values are alternated between the smallest and largest available values, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be at most 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that `k` is even and `k <= n`, so the logic should work for all valid inputs within the constraints.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be close to each other. For example, if `k = 4`, the permutation might look like `[1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, ...]`. The sums of any four consecutive elements will be either `10` or `9` (e.g., `1+4+2+3 = 10` and `4+2+3+1 = 10` or `1+4+2+3 = 10` and `4+2+3+1 = 10`).
  
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function `func_2` processes a specified number of test cases, calling `func_1` for each test case and ensuring that `t` is decremented appropriately.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
