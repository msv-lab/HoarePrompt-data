Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`, and `idx` is even.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. Since `bottom_v` was previously equal to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`, it now becomes `bottom_v + 1`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
