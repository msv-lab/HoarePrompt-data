Output State: The loop continues to execute until `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is no longer less than `len(permutation)`. After all iterations, `idx` will continue to increment by 1 with each iteration of the loop, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will keep increasing by `k` each time it enters the loop, and `bottom_v` will increase by 1 each time `idx` is even, while `top_v` will decrease by 1 each time `idx` is odd. The elements in `permutation` at indices where `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` lands will be filled according to whether `idx` is even or odd, with `bottom_v + 1` for even `idx` and `top_v - 1` for odd `idx`. The final state of `permutation` will reflect these updates, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will eventually exceed `len(permutation)`, causing the loop to terminate.

The exact final values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` depend on how many times the loop iterates, but they will continue to follow their respective patterns (increasing for `bottom_v` and decreasing for `top_v`) until the loop condition is no longer met.
