Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This sets `t` as an integer representing the number of test cases. The conditions for `n` and `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even) remain as preconditions for each test case but are not affected by this line of code.
