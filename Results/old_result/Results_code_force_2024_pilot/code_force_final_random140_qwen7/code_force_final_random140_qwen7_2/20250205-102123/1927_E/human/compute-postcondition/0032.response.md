Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1, `permutation` list will be filled such that it starts with 1 at index 0, then alternates between increasing values starting from `bottom_v` (which starts at 1) and decreasing values starting from `top_v` (which starts at `n`). After all iterations, `permutation` will contain all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once, in a pattern determined by the loop's logic. Specifically, the first half of the list (`permutation[0:k]`) will contain the smallest `k/2` numbers in ascending order, and the second half (`permutation[k:n]`) will contain the largest `k/2` numbers in descending order. This pattern will repeat until all elements of `permutation` are filled. The `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `bottom_v` will be `n - k/2 + 1` and the `top_v` will be `k/2 + 1`.**

The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, while the rest of the variables (`permutation`, `bottom_v`, `top_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`) remain as described in the initial state since the code only modifies `idx`.
