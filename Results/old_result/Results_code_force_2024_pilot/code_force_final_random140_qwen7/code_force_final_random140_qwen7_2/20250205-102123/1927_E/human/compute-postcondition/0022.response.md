Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `permutation[0]` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even, `bottom_v` is either 1 or 3, `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`, and `idx` is not even.**

Explanation: The code increments `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`, so its new value is `k + k = 2k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
