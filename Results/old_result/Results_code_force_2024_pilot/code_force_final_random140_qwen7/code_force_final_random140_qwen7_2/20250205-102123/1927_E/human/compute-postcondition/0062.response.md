Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 3 * k + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + 3 * k + 1`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `top_v - 2`.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. Given that initially `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was equal to `idx + 2 * k + 1`, after executing the line, its new value becomes `idx + 3 * k + 1`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
