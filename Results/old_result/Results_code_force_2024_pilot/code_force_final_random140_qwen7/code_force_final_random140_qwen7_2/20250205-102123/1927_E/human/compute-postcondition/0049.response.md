Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + k + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + k + 1`; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`, if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is equal to `top_v - 1`**

Explanation: The code `bottom_v += 1` increments the value of `bottom_v` by 1. The other variables (`idx`, `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, `len(permutation)`, `permutation`, `top_v`) remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `bottom_v` is used in the condition for updating `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`.
