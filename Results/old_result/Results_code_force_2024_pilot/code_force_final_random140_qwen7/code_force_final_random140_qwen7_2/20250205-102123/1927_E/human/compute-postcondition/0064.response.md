Output State: `idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + (1 - n)`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `top_v - n`.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `idx` will still be less than `k`. The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`, indicating the last index updated within the loop. The length of `permutation` remains greater than `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`. Depending on whether `idx` is even or odd, the value in `permutation` at the final `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will either be `bottom_v + (1 - n)` (if `idx` is even) or `top_v - n` (if `idx` is odd).
