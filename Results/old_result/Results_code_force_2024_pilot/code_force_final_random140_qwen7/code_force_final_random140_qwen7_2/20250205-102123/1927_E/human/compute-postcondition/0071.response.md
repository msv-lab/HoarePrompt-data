Output State: **`idx` is `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is replaced with `bottom_v + 1`, and `idx` is even.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `idx` remains `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must still be less than `len(permutation)`, and `len(permutation)` is still greater than `nk + n + k - 2`. Additionally, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now replaced with `bottom_v + 1` instead of just `bottom_v`.
