Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[2k]` is `n` or `n-1`, `n` must be greater than `2k`, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n`, `bottom_v` is either 1 or 3, `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`, and `idx` is not even.**

Explanation: The code `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v` updates the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` (which is `2k`) to the value of `top_v`. Since `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1`, the value at `permutation[2k]` will be one of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
