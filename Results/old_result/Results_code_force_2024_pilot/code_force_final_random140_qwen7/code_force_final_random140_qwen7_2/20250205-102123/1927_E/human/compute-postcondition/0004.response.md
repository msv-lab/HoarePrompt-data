The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This means that `t` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration and is now greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary since `t` is already greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`**
