Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input, where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even. It then constructs a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) following a specific pattern and prints the permutation as a space-separated string. The final state of the program is that the constructed permutation is printed to the standard output.**
