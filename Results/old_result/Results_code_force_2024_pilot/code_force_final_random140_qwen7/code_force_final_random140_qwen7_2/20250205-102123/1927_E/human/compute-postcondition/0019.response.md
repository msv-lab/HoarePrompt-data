Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with `permutation[k]` set to `n`; `n` and `k` are integers with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even; `bottom_v` is 2; `top_v` is `n`; `permutation[0]` is 1; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`; `idx` is not even.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `top_v` (which is `n`) to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`, the first element of the permutation list that gets updated is `permutation[k]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
