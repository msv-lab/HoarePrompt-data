Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either replaced with `bottom_v + 1` if `idx % 2 == 0`, or replaced with `top_v - 1` if `idx % 2 != 0`.**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increases the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`. The conditions for replacing `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` with `bottom_v + 1` or `top_v - 1` based on whether `idx % 2 == 0` or `idx % 2 != 0` remain unchanged and will be evaluated after this line of code. The other variables and their conditions remain as per the initial postcondition.
