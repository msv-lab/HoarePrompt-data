Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]' is assigned the value of 'top_v' - 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx' and 'top_v' retain their original values.** 

Explanation: The variable `top_v` is decremented by 1, resulting in `top_v - 1`. The `permutation` list is updated at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` with this new value. The original values of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `top_v` remain unchanged.
