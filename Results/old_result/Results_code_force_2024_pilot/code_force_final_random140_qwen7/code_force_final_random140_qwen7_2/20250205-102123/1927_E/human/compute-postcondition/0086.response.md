Output State: **`permutation'` is updated such that if `idx % 2 == 0`, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to `bottom_v + 1`, and if `idx % 2 != 0`, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is assigned the value of `top_v - 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is incremented by `k`.**

This means that the `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` variable has been incremented by `k`, while the `permutation'` list has been updated according to the specified conditions. All other variables retain their original values.
