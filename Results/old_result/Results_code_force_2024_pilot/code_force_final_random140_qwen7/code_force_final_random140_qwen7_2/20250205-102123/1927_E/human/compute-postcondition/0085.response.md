Postcondition: `permutation'` is updated such that if `idx % 2 == 0`, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to `bottom_v + 1`, and if `idx % 2 != 0`, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is assigned the value of `top_v - 1`. All other variables retain their original values.
