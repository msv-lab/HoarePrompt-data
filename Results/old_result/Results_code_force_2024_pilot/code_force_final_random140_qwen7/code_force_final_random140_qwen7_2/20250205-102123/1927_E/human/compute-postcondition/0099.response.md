Output State: **`result` is a string containing all integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a string `result` by joining all elements of the `permutation` list into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by a space. Since the `permutation` list contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once, the resulting string `result` will contain these integers separated by spaces. The initial state of the `permutation` list is not altered by this operation; only the new variable `result` is created and assigned the joined string value.
