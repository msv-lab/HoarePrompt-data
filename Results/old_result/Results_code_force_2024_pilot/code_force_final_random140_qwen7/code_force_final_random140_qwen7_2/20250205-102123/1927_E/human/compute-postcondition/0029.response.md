Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[2k]` is either `bottom_v + 1` or `n` or `n-1`, `n` must be greater than `2k`, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n`, `bottom_v` is either 1 or 3, `top_v` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k + k`, and `idx` is not even.**

Explanation: The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was originally set to `2k`. After executing the line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k`, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to `2k + k`, which simplifies to `3k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
