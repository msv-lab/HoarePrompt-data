Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[2k]` is `bottom_v`, `n` must be greater than `2k`, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n`, `bottom_v` is either 1 or 3, `top_v` is either `n` or `n-1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`, and `idx` is not even.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `bottom_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`, the value of `bottom_v` (which is either 1 or 3) is assigned to `permutation[2k]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
