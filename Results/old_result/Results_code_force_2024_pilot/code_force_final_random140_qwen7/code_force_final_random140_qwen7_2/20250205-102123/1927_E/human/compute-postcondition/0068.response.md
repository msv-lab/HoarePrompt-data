Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `idx` is `k`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.
   - `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Currently, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is currently `k`, we need to ensure that `k` is less than `len(permutation)`.

Given the current state and the loop condition, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` (which is `k`) is less than `len(permutation)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`idx` is `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`**
