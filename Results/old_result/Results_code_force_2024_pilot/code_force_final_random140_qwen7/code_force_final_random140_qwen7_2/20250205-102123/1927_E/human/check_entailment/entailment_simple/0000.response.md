Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two pointers `bottom_v` starting at 1 and `top_v` starting at `n` to fill the `permutation` list.
   - The loop fills the `permutation` list in a specific pattern:
     - If the index `idx` is even, it assigns the smallest available value (`bottom_v`) to the positions.
     - If the index `idx` is odd, it assigns the largest available value (`top_v`) to the positions.
   - This ensures that the values from 1 to `n` are used exactly once in the `permutation` list.
   - The resulting permutation is printed.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, `t` is decremented until it reaches 0.

3. **K-Level Permutation Check**:
   - The constructed permutation in `func_1` ensures that the difference between any two sums of continuous segments of length `k` is at most 1.
   - This is because the values are alternately assigned from the lowest to highest and vice versa, ensuring that the sums of segments of length `k` do not deviate too much from each other.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the constraints correctly, including the range of `n` and `k`.
   - The solution guarantees that the permutation is constructed within the given constraints.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
