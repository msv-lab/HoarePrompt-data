Output State: **`idx` is `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`. `top_v` is `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] - 1`, and `idx` remains odd.**

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1, so `top_v` becomes `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
