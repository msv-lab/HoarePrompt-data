Output State: **`idx` is less than `k` and equals `idx + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed; if `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v + (1 - n)`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `top_v - n`.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since `idx` was initially less than `k` and equals `idx + n * k + (n - 1)`, after incrementing, `idx` now equals `idx + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
