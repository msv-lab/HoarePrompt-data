Output State: **`idx` is less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 2 * k + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than `idx + 2 * k + 1`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now equal to `bottom_v`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` from `top_v - 1` to `bottom_v`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx` remains less than `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still equal to `idx + 2 * k + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is still greater than `idx + 2 * k + 1`. The new value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`.
