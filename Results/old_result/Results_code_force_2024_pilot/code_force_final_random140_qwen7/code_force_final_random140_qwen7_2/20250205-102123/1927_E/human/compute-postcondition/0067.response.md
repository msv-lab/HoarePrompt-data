Output State: **`idx` is `k`; `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`; `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2`**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx` assigns the value of `idx`, which is `k`, to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `len(permutation)` is greater than `nk + n + k - 2` also remains valid.
