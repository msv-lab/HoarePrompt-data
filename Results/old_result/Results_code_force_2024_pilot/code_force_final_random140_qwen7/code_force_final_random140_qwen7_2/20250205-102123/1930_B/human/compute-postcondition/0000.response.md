Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute based on the input value provided by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the input value is valid according to the constraints provided.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input value (which determines the number of iterations) is within the specified range.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment**:
- Since the loop is driven by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input value is within the range \(1 \leq \text{input value} \leq 10^3\).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input value is valid for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and the input value must be within the range \(1 \leq \text{input value} \leq 10^3\)**.
