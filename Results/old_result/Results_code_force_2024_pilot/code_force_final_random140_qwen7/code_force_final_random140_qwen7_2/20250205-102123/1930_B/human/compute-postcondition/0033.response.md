Output State: **`n` is greater than 13, `i` equals `n // 2`, `a` is a list where for each `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `a[2 * i]` equals `i + 1` and `a[2 * i + 1]` equals `n - i`, and `a[n - 1]` equals `n // 2 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is greater than 13, `i` equals `n // 2`, and `a` is a list where for each `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `a[2 * i]` equals `i + 1` and `a[2 * i + 1]` equals `n - i`.
- The code `a[n - 1] = n // 2 + 1` updates the element at index `n - 1` of list `a` to `n // 2 + 1`.
- All other elements of `a` remain unchanged according to the initial conditions. Therefore, the updated list `a` follows the same pattern as before, except for the last element which is now `n // 2 + 1`.
