Postcondition: `n` is greater than 13, `i` equals `n // 2`, `a` is a list where for each `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `a[2 * i]` equals `i + 1` and `a[2 * i + 1]` equals `n - i`. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element `a[n - 1]` equals `n // 2 + 1`. All other elements of `a` remain as they were initially.
