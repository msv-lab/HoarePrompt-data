Output State: **`a[6]` is 4, `t` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `a[2 * i] = i + 1` updates the element at index `2 * i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, `2 * i` equals 6. Therefore, `a[6]` is set to `i + 1`, which is 4. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
