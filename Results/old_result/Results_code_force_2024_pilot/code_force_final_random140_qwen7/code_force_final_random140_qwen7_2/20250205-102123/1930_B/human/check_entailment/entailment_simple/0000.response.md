Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic of the function `func()` step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - It initializes a list `a` with the integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then constructs the permutation according to the specified pattern:
     - For even `n`, the permutation will have pairs of the form `[i+1, n-i]` for `i` from 0 to `n//2 - 1`.
     - For odd `n`, the same pattern is applied up to `n//2 - 1`, and the middle element is set to `n//2 + 1`.

3. **Handling Odd Lengths**:
   - If `n` is odd, the last element of the list `a` is set to `n // 2 + 1`. This ensures that the length of the list remains `n` and the permutation is constructed correctly.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed list `a` for each test case.

Let's verify if this construction guarantees that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (with `1 ≤ i, j < n` and `i ≠ j`) exist such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

- For even `n`, the constructed permutation is `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2]`.
  - Each pair `[i+1, n-i]` ensures that no two elements in the same pair can divide each other because `i+1` and `n-i` are relatively prime (since `i+1` and `n-i` are consecutive in the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`).
  - Similarly, `p_{i+1}` (which is `n-i`) cannot divide `p_{j+1}` (which is `n-j`) because `n-i` and `n-j` are also relatively prime.

- For odd `n`, the constructed permutation is `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2+1, n//2+1]`.
  - The same argument applies as for even `n`, ensuring that no two elements in the same pair can divide each other.
  - The middle element `n//2 + 1` is placed in the correct position to maintain the structure and ensure no division conditions are violated.

Given the construction method, the permutation generated by the function satisfies the required condition.

Therefore, the function correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
