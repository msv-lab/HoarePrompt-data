Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `n // 2`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - The value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`
   - The value of `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1`

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(n // 2)`. This means the loop continues as long as `i < n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was some value `k` (where `k < n // 2`). For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration to occur is `k + 1 < n // 2`, which simplifies to `k < n // 2 - 1`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - The value of `a[2 * (k + 1) + 1]` will be `n - (k + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - k - 1`.
   - The value of `a[2 * (k + 1)]` will be `(k + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 2`.

Given these updates, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a[2 * (i + 1) + 1]` is `n - (i + 1)`; `a[2 * (i + 1)]` is `i + 2`**
