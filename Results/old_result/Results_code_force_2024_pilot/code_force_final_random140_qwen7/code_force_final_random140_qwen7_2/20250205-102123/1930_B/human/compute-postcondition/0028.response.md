Output State: **`n` must be greater than 13, `i` is `i + 1`, `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1`, `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[2 * i + 1]` to `n - i`. Since `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, the value of `a[2 * (i + 1) + 1]` is now `n - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - i - 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `a[2 * i + 1]`.
