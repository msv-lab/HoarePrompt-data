Output State: **`a[8]` is 5, `a[6]` is 4, `a[9]` is 3, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 6**

Explanation: The code `a[2 * i] = i + 1` updates the element at index `2 * i` in the list `a` to the value `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 4, `2 * i` equals 8. Therefore, `a[8]` is updated to `4 + 1`, which is 5. The other values of `a`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.
