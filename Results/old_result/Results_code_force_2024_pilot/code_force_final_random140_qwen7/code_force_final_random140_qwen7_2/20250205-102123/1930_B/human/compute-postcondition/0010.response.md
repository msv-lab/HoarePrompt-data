Output State: **`a[6]` is 4, `t` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `a[9]` is 3, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 6**

Explanation: The code `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i` updates the list `a` at index `2 * i + 1`. Given that `i` is 4, the new index is `2 * 4 + 1 = 9`. Since `n` must be greater than 6, the value of `n - i` (which is `n - 4`) is assigned to `a[9]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
