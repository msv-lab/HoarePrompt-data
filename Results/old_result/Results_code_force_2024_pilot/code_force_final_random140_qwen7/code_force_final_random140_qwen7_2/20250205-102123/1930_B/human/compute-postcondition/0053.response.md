Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **List Construction**: 
   - The list `a` is constructed based on the value of `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, the list `a` will be `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2+1, n//2+1]`.
   - If `n` is even, the list `a` will be `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2]`.
   - The length of `a` is guaranteed to be odd.
   - Additionally, `a[n - 1]` is specified to be `n // 2 + 1` if the length of `a` is odd.

2. **Understanding the List Structure**:
   - The list alternates between odd numbers starting from 1 and decreasing even numbers starting from `n` until it reaches the middle.
   - For both odd and even `n`, the last element of the list is `n // 2 + 1`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Given these details, let's consider the general form of the list `a`:

- If `n` is odd, the list `a` will look like this: `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2+1, n//2+1]`.
- If `n` is even, the list `a` will look like this: `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2]`.

In both cases, the last element is `n // 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the elements of the list `a` with a space separating each element.

Output: **1 n 3 n-1 5 n-2 ... n//2+1 (where n is the given value and the sequence alternates as described)**
