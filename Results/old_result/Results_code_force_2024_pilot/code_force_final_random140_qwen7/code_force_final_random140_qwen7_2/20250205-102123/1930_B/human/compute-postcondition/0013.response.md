Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 7, `i` is 4, `a` is a list where `a[1]` to `a[8]` are modified as follows: `a[1]` is 2, `a[2]` is 3, `a[3]` to `a[8]` are set to their respective values based on the loop, specifically `a[3]` is 6, `a[4]` is 7, `a[5]` is 4, `a[6]` is 4, `a[7]` is 5, `a[8]` is 5, and all other elements of `a` remain unchanged.

This output state is calculated by observing the pattern in which the loop modifies the list `a`. The loop runs until `i` reaches `n // 2`. Given that the loop executes 3 times, `i` is 4 when the loop finishes. For each iteration, the loop sets `a[2 * i + 1]` to `n - i` and `a[2 * i]` to `i + 1`. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `a[1]` to `a[8]` will be as described above, and all other elements of `a` remain unchanged.
