Output State: The list `a` will be structured as follows based on the final iteration of the loop:

- If `n` is odd, `a` will be `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2+1, n//2+1]`.
- If `n` is even, `a` will be `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2]`.

In both cases, the length of `a` will be equal to `n`. The list `a` is constructed such that for each `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `a[2 * i]` equals `i + 1` and `a[2 * i + 1]` equals `n - i`. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element `a[n - 1]` will be `n // 2 + 1`.
