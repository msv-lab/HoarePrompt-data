Output State: **`n` must be greater than 13, `i` is `i + 1`, `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `a[2 * i] = i + 1` updates the value of `a[2 * i]` to `i + 1`. Given the initial state, `n` must be greater than 13, `i` is `i + 1`, and `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1`. Since the code only affects `a[2 * i]`, the other conditions remain unchanged.
