Output State: **The value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`; `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `i + 1` to `a[2 * i]`. This updates the array `a` such that the element at index `2 * i` is now `i + 1`. The value of `a[2 * i + 1]` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `a[2 * i]` and retains the original value for `a[2 * i + 1]`.
