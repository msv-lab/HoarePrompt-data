You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        for i in range(n // 2):
            a[2 * i + 1] = n - i
            a[2 * i] = i + 1
        
        if len(a) % 2 == 1:
            a[n - 1] = n // 2 + 1
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a list `a` where for each `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `a[2 * i]` equals `i + 1` and `a[2 * i + 1]` equals `n - i`. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element `a[n - 1]` equals `n // 2 + 1`. All other elements of `a` remain unchanged.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will be structured as follows:
    #- For even `n`, the list will be `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2]`.
    #- For odd `n`, the list will be `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, ..., n//2+1, n//2+1]`.
    #
    #The length of `a` will always be equal to `n`, and the specific values of `a` will depend on the value of `n` as described above.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers: t (a positive integer between 1 and 10^3) and n (an integer between 3 and 10^5). It ensures that the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns a result based on the given t and n for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
