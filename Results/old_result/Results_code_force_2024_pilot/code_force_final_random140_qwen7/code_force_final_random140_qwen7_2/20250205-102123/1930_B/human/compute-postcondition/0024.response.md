Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n // 2`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 12.
   - `a[2 * i]` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - `a[2 * i + 1]` is equal to `n - i`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n // 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i + 1` must still satisfy this condition, meaning `i + 1 < n // 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 12 (since it doesn't change within the loop).
   - The values of `a[2 * i]` and `a[2 * i + 1]` will change according to the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`. The new values for `a[2 * i_new]` and `a[2 * i_new + 1]` will be:
- `a[2 * (i + 1)] = (i + 1) + 1 = i + 2`
- `a[2 * (i + 1) + 1] = n - (i + 1) = n - i - 1`

However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of the loop head variables, the relevant states to adjust are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 12, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`**.

To be more precise, if we denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`, then:
- `i` becomes `i_new = i + 1`
- `n` must still be greater than `i_new`

So the final state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 13, `i` is `i + 1`**.
