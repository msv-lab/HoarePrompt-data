Output State: **`n` must be greater than 13; `i` is `i + 1`; `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1`; `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[2 * i]` to `i + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `n` must be greater than 13, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`. After executing the code, `a[2 * i]` is now `i + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
