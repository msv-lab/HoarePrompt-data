To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze its logic and the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided function `func()` attempts to construct such a permutation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the function does:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
3. It initializes a list `a` with values from 1 to \( n \).
4. It then swaps elements in positions \( 2i + 1 \) and \( 2i \) for \( i \) ranging from 0 to \( n//2 - 1 \), setting \( a[2*i + 1] = n - i \) and \( a[2*i] = i + 1 \).
5. If \( n \) is odd, it sets the last element to \( n // 2 + 1 \).
6. Finally, it prints the resulting permutation.

### Verification
Let's verify if this approach satisfies the problem constraints and requirements:

- **Even \( n \)**:
  - Consider \( n = 4 \). The initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - After swapping, the list becomes `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
  - Check pairs:
    - \( p_1 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \) and \( p_2 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
  - This permutation works.

- **Odd \( n \)**:
  - Consider \( n = 3 \). The initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - After swapping, the list becomes `[1, 3, 2]`.
  - Check pairs:
    - \( p_1 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 3 \) and \( p_2 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
  - This permutation works.

- **General Case**:
  - For larger \( n \), the pattern ensures that no two consecutive elements have the required divisibility condition.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly constructs a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
