Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list where `a[1]` is equal to `n - 1`, `a[2]` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 3), and all other elements of `a` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a[2 * i] = i + 1` updates the list `a` at index `2 * i` with the value `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `2 * i` equals 2. So, `a[2]` is set to `i + 1`, which is 2 + 1 = 3. The other elements of the list `a` remain unchanged.
