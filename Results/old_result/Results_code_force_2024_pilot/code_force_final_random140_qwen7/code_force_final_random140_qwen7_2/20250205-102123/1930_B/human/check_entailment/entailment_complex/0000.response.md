Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
2. The provided solution generates a permutation based on the value of \( n \):
   - For even \( n \), the list is structured as \([1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, \ldots, n/2, n/2]\).
   - For odd \( n \), the list is structured as \([1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-2, \ldots, (n+1)/2, (n+1)/2]\).
3. Let's verify if this construction satisfies the problem constraints:
   - Consider any pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \).
   - The constructed permutation alternates between small and large numbers, ensuring that no two consecutive numbers have a divisibility relationship that would violate the condition.
   - Specifically, for any \( k \), \( p_{2k} = k + 1 \) and \( p_{2k+1} = n - k \). This ensures that \( p_{2k} \) and \( p_{2k+1} \) are not divisible by each other because they are from different halves of the range.
4. The construction handles both even and odd \( n \) correctly, ensuring that the resulting permutation meets the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly constructs a valid permutation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
