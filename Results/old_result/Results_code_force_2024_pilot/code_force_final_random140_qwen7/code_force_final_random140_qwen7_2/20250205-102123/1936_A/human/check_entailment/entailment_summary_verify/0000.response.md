### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description and Requirements
- We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
- We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \((p_a \mid p_b)\) vs \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
- After finding the indices, we need to print them.

#### Provided Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to perform a query and return the result.
   - However, the function signature and implementation details are missing in the provided code snippet. This is a critical issue as the function is used extensively in the main program.

2. **Main Program Logic**
   - The program iterates through indices starting from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1` to compare \((p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to \(i\).
   - Then, it initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to \([0]\).
   - It iterates through indices starting from 1 to \(n-1\) again and uses `func_1` to compare \((mx \mid ans1)\) with \((i \mid ans1)\).
     - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` to an empty list and sets `mx` to \(i\).
     - If the result is `=`, it appends \(i\) to `v`.
   - It selects the first element of `v` as `mx` and prints `v`.
   - Finally, it iterates through the elements of `v` and uses `func_1` to determine the maximum XOR value and prints the corresponding indices.

#### Issues Identified
1. **Undefined `func_1` Function**
   - The function `func_1` is called but not defined in the provided code snippet. This will result in a runtime error.

2. **Incorrect Query Logic**
   - The logic for determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is flawed.
   - The program attempts to find the maximum value of the bitwise OR operation and then tries to find the indices that maximize the XOR operation, but this approach is not guaranteed to work as intended.

3. **Redundant and Incorrect Steps**
   - The program unnecessarily resets and updates variables in a way that does not align with the problem requirements.

#### Correct Approach
- A more effective approach would involve using the properties of bitwise operations to efficiently find the maximum XOR value.
- One common strategy is to use a divide-and-conquer approach to narrow down the indices that could potentially maximize the XOR value.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the undefined `func_1` function and the flawed logic for determining the indices that maximize the XOR value.
