Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and initializes `ans1` to 0.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR Result:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` to find the index `i` such that `(p_i | p_i)` is maximized.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `ans1` as both `a` and `b`, and `i` as both `c` and `d`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`.

3. **Finding the Indices with Maximum XOR:**
   - It initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` as a list containing 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` to find the index `i` such that `(p_i | ans1)` is maximized.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `mx` as `a` and `ans1` as `b`, and `i` as both `c` and `d`.
   - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` to an empty list and updates `mx` to `i` and adds `i` to `v`.
   - If the result is `=`, it simply adds `i` to `v`.

4. **Selecting the Best Pair:**
   - It selects the first element of `v` as `mx` and prints `v`.
   - It initializes `ans` to `v[0]`.
   - It iterates through the rest of the elements in `v` to find the index `i` such that `(p_i | p_i)` is greater than `(ans | ans)`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `ans` as both `a` and `b`, and `v[i]` as both `c` and `d`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - It prints the final pair of indices `ans` and `ans1`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Query Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)` and `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)` to find the maximum bitwise OR results. However, these queries are not valid because `a` and `b` should be different indices.
   - The program should use different indices for `a` and `b` in the queries.

2. **Incorrect Selection of Indices:**
   - The program selects the first element of `v` as `mx` and prints `v`. This is incorrect because `v` might contain multiple indices that give the same maximum bitwise OR result.
   - The program should select the best pair of indices from `v` that gives the maximum XOR result.

3. **Incorrect Final Pair Selection:**
   - The program selects the best pair of indices from `v` based on the bitwise OR result, but it should select the pair that gives the maximum XOR result.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the queries and does not select the correct pair of indices that maximize the XOR result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: **False**
