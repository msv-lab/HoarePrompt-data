Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly finds the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.

1. **Initialization and First Query:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \(n\) of the permutation.
   - It initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates from 1 to \(n-1\). For each index \(i\), it calls `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`. This query compares \((p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\). Since both sides are the same, the result is always `=`. This step seems unnecessary and doesn't provide useful information.

2. **Finding Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to `[0]`.
   - It iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and for each index \(i\), it calls `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)`.
     - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` to an empty list and sets `mx` to \(i\) and appends \(i\) to `v`.
     - If the result is `=`, it appends \(i\) to `v`.
   - This step aims to find the index \(i\) that maximizes \((p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1})\).

3. **Selecting the Best Pair:**
   - The program selects the first element from `v` as `mx` and prints `v`.
   - It then iterates through the rest of the elements in `v` and uses `func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])` to compare \((p_{ans} \mid p_{ans})\) with \((p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]})\). Since both sides are the same, this step is redundant.
   - Finally, it prints the pair \((ans, ans1)\).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Redundant Queries:**
   - The initial loop querying \((p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) is unnecessary and does not provide useful information.
   - The final loop querying \((p_{ans} \mid p_{ans})\) with \((p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]})\) is also redundant.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum XOR value is flawed. The program is only comparing OR values and not directly comparing XOR values.
   - The program does not ensure that the selected pair \((ans, ans1)\) has the maximum XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
