Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the comparison of bitwise OR operations, but the implementation of the query logic is flawed. Specifically, the code is not correctly comparing `(p_a | p_b)` with `(p_c | p_d)`.

2. **Incorrect Maximization Logic**: The code attempts to find the maximum XOR value, but the logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is incorrect. It seems to be trying to find the maximum value of `(p_a | p_b)` and then using that to find the maximum XOR, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Output Format**: The code prints the indices `v` directly without formatting them correctly. It should print `! i j` where `i` and `j` are the indices that maximize the XOR value.

4. **Query Count**: The code is not ensuring that the number of queries does not exceed `3n`. While the code is limited to a fixed number of queries, the logic itself is flawed, leading to potential incorrect results even within the query limit.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ans1 = 0
    for i in range(n):
        x = func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)
        if x == '<':
            ans1 = i
    mx = 0
    v = [0]
    for i in range(n):
        x = func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)
        if x == '<':
            v = []
            mx = i
            v.append(i)
        elif x == '=':
            v.append(i)
    if v:
        mx = v[0]
        for i in v:
            x = func_1(mx, mx, i, i)
            if x == '>':
                mx = i
        print(f'! {mx} {ans1}')
    else:
        print(f'! {ans1} {ans1}')

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print(f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}')
    return input()
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Correct Query Logic**: The `func_1` function now correctly prints the query in the required format.
2. **Maximizing XOR**: The code now correctly identifies the indices that maximize the XOR value.
3. **Output Formatting**: The final output is formatted correctly as `! i j`.

This corrected version should adhere to the problem's requirements and constraints.
