Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), all of which are non-negative integers less than \(n\), where \(n\) is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^4\). It prints these parameters and then waits for user input, which must be a non-negative integer between 0 and \(n-1\). The function returns this input value.**
