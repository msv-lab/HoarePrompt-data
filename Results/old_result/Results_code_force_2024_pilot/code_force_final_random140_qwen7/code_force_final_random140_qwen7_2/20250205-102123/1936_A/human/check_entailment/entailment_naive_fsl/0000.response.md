Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses a `func_1` function that is not defined within the provided code snippet. Additionally, the logic for querying and determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is flawed.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is called but not defined in the provided code. This will result in a runtime error.
2. **Incorrect Query Logic**: The logic for determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is not implemented correctly. The program attempts to find the maximum value of the bitwise OR operation and then tries to find the indices that maximize the XOR operation, but this approach is not guaranteed to work as intended.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered correct as it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
