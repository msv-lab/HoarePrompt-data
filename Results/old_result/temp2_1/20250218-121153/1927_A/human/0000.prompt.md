Your task is to generate a Python script with assertions to test the correctness of a given Python program, based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

The output must be a complete Python script with assertions that verify the program’s correctness. Do not execute the program yourself; just provide the test code.
If the code uses `stdin`, include the following helper function to automate input/output capture:

import io
import sys

def capture_output(func, input_data):
    sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
    captured_output = io.StringIO()
    sys.stdout = captured_output
    func()
    sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__
    return captured_output.getvalue().strip()


# Problem:
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        t = int(input())
        x = list(input())
        if 'B' in x:
            start = x.index('B')
            end = len(x) - x[::-1].index('B') - 1
            print(end - start)
        else:
            print(0)



# Your response:
```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.

from program import *

# Write your test cases below
# Each test case should include assertions based on the problem description
# Example:
# assert function_name(input) == expected_output

# Add multiple test cases to ensure correctness across edge cases
assert ...

# End of script
