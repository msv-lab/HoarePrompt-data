Your task is to generate a Python script with assertions to test the correctness of a given Python program, based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

The output must be a complete Python script with assertions that verify the program’s correctness. Do not execute the program yourself; just provide the test code.
If the code uses `stdin`, include the following helper function to automate input/output capture:

import io
import sys

def capture_output(func, input_data):
    sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
    captured_output = io.StringIO()
    sys.stdout = captured_output
    func()
    sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__
    return captured_output.getvalue().strip()


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

# Program:
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')



# Your response:
```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.

from program import *

# Write your test cases below
# Each test case should include assertions based on the problem description
# Example:
# assert function_name(input) == expected_output

# Add multiple test cases to ensure correctness across edge cases
assert ...

# End of script
