`a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `a` and `b` are that they are positive integers with \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(a \neq b\). After the code execution, these conditions still hold.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(a \neq b\)**
