`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we know they are positive integers between 1 and 1000. Variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
