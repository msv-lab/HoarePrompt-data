`a` remains unchanged.
`b` remains unchanged.
`n` remains unchanged.
`m` remains unchanged.
`k` remains unchanged.
`a_floor` is calculated as \((a - 1) \% m + 1\).
`a_block` is assigned the value \((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1\).

Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(a \neq b\); `m` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `a_floor` is \((a - 1) \% m + 1\); `a_block` is \((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1\)**.
