Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fully account for the scenario where the apartments are on different floors within the same block. While the program calculates the block difference and the minimum time to switch blocks, it fails to consider the time required to travel between different floors within the same block. This oversight can lead to incorrect results, as demonstrated by the example input provided:

```
4 10 5
100 105
```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the time to be 10 seconds (10 seconds to switch blocks + 0 seconds to switch floors), while the correct time should be 15 seconds (10 seconds to switch blocks + 5 seconds to switch floors). Therefore, the original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the program.
