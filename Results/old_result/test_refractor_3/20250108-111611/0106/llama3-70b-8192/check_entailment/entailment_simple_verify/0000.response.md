Final: **False**

Reasoning: Despite the detailed annotations, the original assessment correctly points out a flaw in the program's logic. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the time required to move between floors within the same block. The annotations show that the program calculates the minimum time to move between blocks correctly (`min_block_time`), but the time to move between floors within the same block (`min_floor_time`) is incorrectly calculated. 

In the given example with the input:
```
4 10 5
100 105
```
- Apartment 100 is on the 1st floor of the 4th block.
- Apartment 105 is on the 2nd floor of the 4th block.

The program calculates `min_block_time` as 0 (since both apartments are in the same block) and `min_floor_time` as 15 (which includes waiting time and moving up 1 floor), but it should only add the time to move up 1 floor, which is 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time should be 5 seconds, not 15 seconds.

The annotations confirm that the program needs to adjust the `min_floor_time` calculation to reflect the actual time required to move between floors within the same block. Since the program currently does not handle this correctly, the original assessment is accurate.
