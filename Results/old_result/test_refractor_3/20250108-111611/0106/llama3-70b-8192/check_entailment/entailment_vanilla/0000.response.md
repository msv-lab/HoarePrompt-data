Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the target floor is on the same block but the starting floor is on a different floor within the same block. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum time to reach the target block using the formula `min_block_time`, which assumes the minimum time is always the shortest path around the building. However, this does not account for the possibility that the shortest path might involve going up or down the same block if the floors are close enough.

For example, consider the following inputs:
```
3 1 5
7 2
```

In this case:
- Edward is on the 2nd floor of block 2.
- Natasha is on the 1st floor of block 1.

The program calculates the time to move from block 2 to block 1, which is 15 seconds. However, the optimal solution would be for Edward to go directly down from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor within his own block, which takes only 5 seconds. Thus, the total time should be 5 seconds, not 15 seconds.

This example shows that the program does not handle the case where the target floor is on the same block but the starting floor is on a different floor, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.
