Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Calculation of Floor and Block Indices**:
   - The current implementation correctly calculates `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` using the formulas provided.
   - However, the logic for calculating `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` is flawed. Specifically, the way `min_floor_time` is calculated does not cover all possible scenarios, especially when `a_floor` and `b_floor` are different.

2. **Minimum Time Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `min_block_time` considers the minimum time to move between blocks, which is correct.
   - The calculation of `min_floor_time` should consider both directions (up and down) and choose the optimal one. However, the current implementation only handles one direction, which is insufficient.

3. **Lift Usage**:
   - The problem statement specifies that the lift can be used, but the current implementation does not account for using the lift to minimize travel time. The lift is faster and can potentially reduce the time significantly, depending on the exact positions of `a` and `b`.

Here's a more detailed explanation with an example:

### Example Walkthrough
Consider the following input:
```
4 10 5
200 6
```
- `n = 4`, `m = 10`, `k = 5`
- `a = 200`, `b = 6`

#### Current Calculation:
1. Calculate `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`:
   - `a_floor = 200 % 10 + 1 = 10`
   - `a_block = (200 - 1) // (10 * 5) + 1 = 4`
   - `b_floor = 6 % 10 + 1 = 6`
   - `b_block = (6 - 1) // (10 * 5) + 1 = 1`

2. Calculate `min_block_time`:
   - `abs(a_block - b_block) = 3`
   - `min_block_time = min(3, 4) * 15 = 45`

3. Calculate `min_floor_time`:
   - Since `a_floor > b_floor`, `min_floor_time = (10 - 6) * 5 + 10 = 30`

4. Total time: `45 + 30 = 75`

However, the correct approach would involve considering the lift to optimize the travel time. For instance, if Edvard uses the lift to go to the first floor of the target block, the actual time could be much less.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider the following steps:
1. Determine the optimal path between blocks using the lift.
2. Calculate the minimum time to move between floors using the elevator and stairs.
3. Account for the possibility of using the lift to minimize the total travel time.

Given the complexity, the current implementation fails to cover all necessary scenarios and thus is not correct according to the problem description.
