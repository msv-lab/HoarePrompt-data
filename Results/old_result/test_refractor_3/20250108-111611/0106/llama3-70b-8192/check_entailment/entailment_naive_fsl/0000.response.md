Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the apartments are on different floors within the same block. Specifically, it calculates the minimum time based solely on the block difference and the floor difference, but it does not consider the time to go up or down multiple floors within the same block.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 10 5
100 105
```
- Apartment 100 is on the 1st floor of the 4th block.
- Apartment 105 is on the 2nd floor of the 4th block.

The program would calculate the time to move from the 4th block to the 4th block (0 seconds), and then from the 1st floor to the 2nd floor (5 seconds). However, it does not account for the fact that going from the 1st floor to the 2nd floor involves moving up 1 floor, which takes 5 seconds.

The correct calculation should include the time to move up 1 floor (5 seconds). Therefore, the total time should be 5 seconds, not 0 seconds.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the absolute difference in floors within the same block and multiply it by 5 seconds.
