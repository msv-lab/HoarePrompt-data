First, let's analyze the initial state:
- `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `apartment` is an integer within the range [1, n*m*k].
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.
- `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.

Now, let's look at the code snippet:
```python
floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
```

This line of code calculates the `floor` by dividing `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1. We need to express this in terms of the original variables:

Given:
- `floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.

So,
- `floor = ((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1`.

Let's denote `r` as the remainder when `apartment - 1` is divided by `m * k`, i.e., `r = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. Therefore, the formula for `floor` can be written as:
- `floor = r // k + 1`.

Since `r` is the remainder, its value is between 0 and `m * k - 1`. Thus, `floor` will be an integer from 1 to `k` depending on the value of `r`.

To summarize, the variables remain unchanged except for `floor`, which is now calculated based on the given formula. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`block` is `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `apartment` is an integer within the range [1, n*m*k]; `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `floor_within_block` is `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`; `floor` is `((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1`.**
