Output State: **The program returns total_time which is calculated as follows:**
- `time_to_exit` is \(10 + (floor_a - 1)\) if `floor_a` is not 1, otherwise 0.
- `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
- `reverse_walk_time` is \((n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15\).
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
- `total_time` is `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + (floor_b - 1) * 5`.
