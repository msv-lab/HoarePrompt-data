The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. These parameters are described as follows:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k and a != b.

The function calculates and returns a value named `total_time`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept five parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) and return a value named `total_time`.
