The code updates the variable `time_to_target_floor` by setting it to `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The value of `floor_b` is unchanged, and the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated value of `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\), `block_a` is the first return value of `get_location(a)`, `floor_a` is the second return value of `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is the first return value of `get_location(b)`, `floor_b` is the second return value of `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is \(10 + (floor_a - 1)\) if `floor_a` != 1 else 0, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is \((n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15\), `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is \((floor_b - 1) * 5\).**
