Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates and returns the `total_time` required for a person to move from the location corresponding to `a` to the location corresponding to `b` in a building with `n` floors, `m` blocks per floor, and `k` elevators per block. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the steps and actions performed:

1. The function first determines the floor and block positions of both `a` and `b` using the `get_location` function.
2. Based on the floor position of `a`, it calculates the `time_to_exit` required to exit the elevator, which is 0 if `a` is on the ground floor (i.e., `floor_a == 1`) or `10 + (floor_a - 1)` otherwise.
3. It calculates the `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` required to walk directly or reverse direction between the blocks corresponding to `a` and `b`, considering the modulus operation to wrap around the block count.
4. The `min_walk_time` is determined as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
5. The `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `5 * (floor_b - 1)` because each floor above the ground floor takes 5 units of time to reach.
6. Finally, the `total_time` is computed as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

The function handles all valid inputs for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` within their specified ranges and correctly calculates the total time required for the movement. Edge cases such as when `a` or `b` is on the ground floor are appropriately handled.**

This summary covers all the steps and actions performed by the function based on the actual code and includes potential edge cases.
