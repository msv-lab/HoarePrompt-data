The code defines a new variable `reverse_walk_time` which is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. This calculation does not affect any other variables, and it uses the values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` from the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\)
- `block_a` is the first return value of `get_location(a)`
- `floor_a` is the second return value of `get_location(a)`
- `block_b` is the first return value of `get_location(b)`
- `floor_b` is the second return value of `get_location(b)`
- `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)` if `floor_a` != 1 else 0
- `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`

After executing the code, the value of `reverse_walk_time` is updated, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\), `block_a` is the first return value of `get_location(a)`, `floor_a` is the second return value of `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is the first return value of `get_location(b)`, `floor_b` is the second return value of `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is \(10 + (floor_a - 1)\) if `floor_a` != 1 else 0, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is \((n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15\)**
