The code `min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)` calculates the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` and assigns it to `min_walk_time`. The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` depend on the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`.

Given:
- `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
- `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.

The value of `min_walk_time` will be the smaller of these two times.

Since the actual values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min_walk_time`. However, we know that `min_walk_time` will be one of the two values calculated from `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\), `block_a` is the first return value of `get_location(a)`, `floor_a` is the second return value of `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is the first return value of `get_location(b)`, `floor_b` is the second return value of `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is \(10 + (floor_a - 1)\) if `floor_a` != 1 else 0, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is \((n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
