Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= n * m * k and a != b, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= n * m * k and a != b, `block_a` is the first return value of `get_location(a)`, `floor_a` is the second return value of `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is the first return value of `get_location(b)`, `floor_b` is the second return value of `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` equals 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `floor_a` is not equal to 1 and `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)`.***
