The code `total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor` calculates the total time by adding `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. Let's break down each component:

1. `time_to_exit` is defined as `10 + (floor_a - 1)` if `floor_a` is not 1, otherwise it is 0.
2. `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
3. `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
4. `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
5. `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

The calculation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, but it introduces new values for `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, and `total_time`.

Since the exact values of `floor_a`, `block_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are not specified, we will keep them as they are in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n \times m \times k\) and \(a \neq b\), `block_a` is the first return value of `get_location(a)`, `floor_a` is the second return value of `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is the first return value of `get_location(b)`, `floor_b` is the second return value of `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is \(10 + (floor_a - 1)\) if `floor_a` != 1 else 0, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is \((n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15\), `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `total_time` is `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + (floor_b - 1) * 5`**.
