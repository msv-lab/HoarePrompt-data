Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not account for the scenario where the target floor is lower than the current floor. In such cases, the program only considers the time to reach the first floor via the elevator and the time to walk to the target block, but it fails to calculate the time required to go down to the target floor using the elevator.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `n = 4`, `m = 10`, `k = 5`
- `a = 200` (4th block, 10th floor)
- `b = 6` (1st block, 1st floor)

The program will incorrectly calculate the time because it does not consider the scenario where the target floor (1st floor) is lower than the current floor (10th floor).

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the time to go down to the target floor if necessary. Here is a revised version of the `func_1` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    (block_a, floor_a) = get_location(a)
    (block_b, floor_b) = get_location(b)
    
    if floor_a == 1:
        time_to_exit = 0
    else:
        time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)
    
    direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15
    reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
    
    # Calculate time to go down if necessary
    time_to_target_floor = (1 - floor_a) * 5 if floor_a > floor_b else 0
    time_to_target_floor += (floor_b - 1) * 5
    
    min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)
    
    total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
    return total_time

def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return (block, floor)
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases correctly.
