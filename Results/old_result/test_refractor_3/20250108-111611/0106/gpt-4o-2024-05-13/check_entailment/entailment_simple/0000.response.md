Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key aspects of the solution:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of blocks (n), floors per block (m), apartments per floor (k), and the apartment numbers of Edward (a) and Natasha (b).
   - The input handling is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Location Calculation:**
   - The `get_location` function correctly calculates the block and floor for a given apartment number. This function is used to determine the positions of both Edward and Natasha.
   - The calculations for block and floor are based on the formulae provided in the problem description:
     - `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
     - `floor = ((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1`

3. **Time Calculations:**
   - The program correctly calculates the time taken to exit the current block (if necessary) using the formula:
     - `time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)` if `floor_a` is not 1.
   - It also calculates the minimum time to walk around the building to reach the target block using:
     - `direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`
     - `reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`
     - `min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)`
   - The time to reach the target floor is calculated as:
     - `time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5`
   - Finally, the total time is computed as:
     - `total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`

4. **Overall Logic:**
   - The program considers all possible scenarios for moving between blocks and floors, including using the elevator and walking.
   - It handles the circular nature of the building correctly, ensuring that the shortest path is chosen.

Given that the program accurately follows the logic and calculations described in the problem statement, it is correct. Therefore, the output is `True`.
