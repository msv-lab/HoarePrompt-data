Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has an issue with handling the case when the input apartment number is outside the valid range [1, n*m*k]. Specifically, the `get_location` function does not check if the input `apartment` is within the valid range, which means it can produce incorrect block and floor numbers. This can lead to incorrect calculations in the `func_1` function, as it relies on accurate block and floor information.

For example, if `n=1`, `m=1`, `k=1`, `a=2`, and `b=1`, the apartment number 2 is out of range, and the `get_location` function will incorrectly calculate the block and floor, leading to incorrect time calculations.
