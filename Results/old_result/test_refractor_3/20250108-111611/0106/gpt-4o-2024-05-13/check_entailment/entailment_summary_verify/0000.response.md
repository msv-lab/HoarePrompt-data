Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the program is correct, but upon closer inspection, there are some issues that need to be addressed based on the provided output hints and the problem description. Specifically, the function `get_location` does not validate whether the input apartment number is within the valid range `[1, n*m*k]`. If the input apartment number is outside this range, the function will still compute block and floor numbers, but these results may be incorrect or undefined. Since the problem description guarantees that the input will be valid, the program should include validation to ensure that the input apartment number is within the specified range. Without this validation, the program may produce incorrect results for invalid inputs.

Given that the problem description specifies that the input will be valid and within the range, and considering that the function `get_location` does not perform this validation, the program is not fully correct. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
