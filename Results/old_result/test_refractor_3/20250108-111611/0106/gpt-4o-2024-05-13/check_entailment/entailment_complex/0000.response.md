Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input apartment number is outside the valid range `[1, n*m*k]`. According to the problem description, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with bounds `1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000`, and `a` and `b` are integers such that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n * m * k` and `a != b`. However, the `get_location` function does not check if the input `apartment` is within the valid range, which could lead to incorrect block and floor values being calculated. This could result in invalid calculations for `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, leading to an incorrect total time calculation.

For example, if `a` or `b` is outside the valid range, the block and floor calculations would produce invalid values, and the subsequent time calculations would be incorrect. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
