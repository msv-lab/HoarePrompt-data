Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to create a list of `N` empty dictionaries, and the provided test cases assert that it correctly returns lists of 5, 6, and 7 empty dictionaries. The annotated version clearly states that the function takes a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list of `N` empty dictionaries. Since the function behaves as expected for the given assertions and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the annotation, the program is correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
