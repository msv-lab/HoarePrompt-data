Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries, as evidenced by the annotations. The function uses list comprehension to generate a list of `N` empty dictionaries, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as intended, returning a list with exactly `N` empty dictionaries. No edge cases or issues have been identified that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
