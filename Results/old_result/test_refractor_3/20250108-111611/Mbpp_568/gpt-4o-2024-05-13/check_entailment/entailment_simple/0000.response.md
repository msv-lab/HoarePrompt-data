Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `N` as input and returns a list containing `N` empty dictionaries. The provided test cases confirm this behavior:

- For `N = 5`, the function returns `[{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]`.
- For `N = 6`, the function returns `[{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}]`.
- For `N = 7`, the function returns `[{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}]`.

The implementation uses a list comprehension to create a list of `N` empty dictionaries, which correctly fulfills the requirement. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
