Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries for the given test cases. The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of `N` empty dictionaries, which aligns with the problem description. Since the function behaves as expected for the given assertions and no edge cases have been identified that would cause the function to fail, the program is correct.
