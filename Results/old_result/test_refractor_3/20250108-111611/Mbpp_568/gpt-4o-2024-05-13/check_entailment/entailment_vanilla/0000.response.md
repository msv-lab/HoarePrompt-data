Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The examples given cover different values of `N` (5, 6, and 7), and the function returns lists with the correct number of empty dictionaries for each case. Since the function behaves as expected for the provided assertions, and there is no indication of any edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program appears to be correct.
