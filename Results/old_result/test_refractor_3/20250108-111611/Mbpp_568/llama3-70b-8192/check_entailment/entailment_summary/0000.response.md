Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of `n` empty dictionaries. The code uses a list comprehension to create a list of `n` empty dictionaries, which accurately implements the problem description. Since the problem description and the output hints do not mention any specific edge cases or functionalities that are missing, and the provided code satisfies the requirement for every potential valid input (a non-negative integer), the program is correct.
