Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1(n)` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries. The annotation states that `n` is a non-negative integer before the function call, which is a valid assumption given the problem description and the nature of the Python `range` function, which only accepts non-negative integers. Therefore, the function will always return a list of empty dictionaries as required, making the original assessment correct.
