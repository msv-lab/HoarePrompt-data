Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list containing `n` empty dictionaries. The comprehension `[{} for _ in range(n)]` generates a list of length `n`, with each element being an empty dictionary `{}`. Since the problem description asks for a function that creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries, and the provided function achieves this exactly, the program is correct.
