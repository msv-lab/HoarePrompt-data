Let's break down the given code snippet step by step to understand what it will print based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Input for `t`**:
   - The first `input()` call reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - This value is converted to an integer using `int(input())`.

2. **Loop for Each Test Case**:
   - The list comprehension `for _ in range(int(input()))` will iterate `t` times, once for each test case.

3. **Input for `p_i`**:
   - Inside the loop, `input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - `map(int, input().split())` converts this list of strings into a list of integers, which represents `p_i`.

4. **Enumerate and Calculate**:
   - `enumerate(map(int, input().split()))` provides both the index `i` and the value `x` for each element in `p_i`.
   - The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is evaluated for each element in `p_i`:
     - `x // 2` gives the integer division of `x` by 2.
     - `3 * (x // 2)` multiplies this result by 3.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder of `x` when divided by 2 (0 if even, 1 if odd).
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` multiplies the remainder by 1 if `i` is less than 3 (i.e., for the first three elements of `p_i`), and by 0 if `i` is 3 (i.e., for the fourth element of `p_i`).
   - The sum of these values is calculated using `sum()`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The sum is divided by 3 using integer division `// 3`.

6. **Output**:
   - The result of the final calculation is converted to a string using `str()`.
   - All results for each test case are joined into a single string with newlines using `'\n'.join()`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `t = 2` and the inputs for `p_i` are:
- For the first test case: `p_i = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- For the second test case: `p_i = [0, 1, 2, 3]`

#### First Test Case:
- `p_i = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Calculation:
  - For `i = 0`, `x = 1`: \(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 1\)
  - For `i = 1`, `x = 2`: \(3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 0 * 1 = 3\)
  - For `i = 2`, `x = 3`: \(3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 4\)
  - For `i = 3`, `x = 4`: \(3 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 2 + 0 * 0 = 6\)
- Sum: \(1 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 14\)
- Final result: \(14 // 3 = 4\)

#### Second Test Case:
- `p_i = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
- Calculation:
  - For `i = 0`, `x = 0`: \(3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 * 0 + 0 * 1 = 0\)
  - For `i = 1`, `x = 1`: \(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 1\)
  - For `i = 2`, `x = 2`: \(3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 0 * 1 = 3\)
  - For `i = 3`, `x = 3`: \(3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 1 * 0 = 3\)
- Sum: \(0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7\)
- Final result: \(7 // 3 = 2\)

### Final Output:
The code will print the results of the calculations for each test case, each on a new line.

Output: **4
2**
