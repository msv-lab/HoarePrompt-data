The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `t` are integers where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and `t` = 1
- `edges` is an empty list
- `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is an empty list
- `start` is an integer such that 1 <= `start` <= `n`
- `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves from the `start` node to each leaf node
- `empty` is True

The state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 0**
