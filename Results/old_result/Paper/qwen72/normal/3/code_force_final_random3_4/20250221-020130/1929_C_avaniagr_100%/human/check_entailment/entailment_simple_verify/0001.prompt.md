You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

The loop itself has finished executing, and the program is ready to terminate or move on to the next part of the code.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of \( y \) coins.
   - If he wins, his coins increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - If he loses, his coins decrease by \( y \).
   - He cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has \( a \) coins.
   - The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
   - It then checks different conditions to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal.

3. **Conditions in the Program:**
   - **Condition 1:** `if x < k - 1`
     - If \( x \) (the maximum number of consecutive losses) is less than \( k - 1 \):
       - If Sasha has at least \( x + 1 \) coins, he can guarantee winning any number of coins.
       - Otherwise, he cannot.
   - **Condition 2:** `elif x == k - 1`
     - If \( x \) is exactly \( k - 1 \):
       - If Sasha has at least \( x + 2 \) coins, he can guarantee winning any number of coins.
       - Otherwise, he cannot.
   - **Condition 3:** `else`
     - If \( x \) is greater than or equal to \( k - 1 \):
       - The program calculates a value \( z \) using a loop.
       - If Sasha has at least \( z \) coins, he can guarantee winning any number of coins.
       - Otherwise, he cannot.

4. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** `if x < k - 1`
     - This condition is correct because if \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can always recover from a series of losses by placing small bets. Specifically, he can place bets of 1 coin and recover after \( x \) losses.
   - **Condition 2:** `elif x == k - 1`
     - This condition is correct because if \( x = k - 1 \), Sasha can still recover from a series of losses, but he needs an extra coin to ensure he can place a bet after \( x \) losses.
   - **Condition 3:** `else`
     - This condition is more complex. The program calculates \( z \) using a loop, which is intended to determine the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee he can always recover from a series of losses. However, the logic in the loop is not clearly explained and might be incorrect.

5. **Detailed Analysis of Condition 3:**
   - The loop in condition 3 is intended to calculate the minimum number of coins \( z \) needed to guarantee recovery.
   - The loop iterates \( x - k + 3 \) times, and in each iteration, it updates \( z \) by adding \( z // (k - 1) + 1 \).
   - This logic is not straightforward and might not correctly capture the minimum number of coins needed for recovery.

6. **Correctness of the Loop Logic:**
   - The loop logic in condition 3 is not clearly justified and might be incorrect. The correct approach to determine the minimum number of coins needed for recovery should involve a more systematic calculation of the total loss and the required recovery.

### Conclusion:
The program's conditions for \( x < k - 1 \) and \( x = k - 1 \) are correct. However, the loop logic in condition 3 is not clearly justified and might be incorrect. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
