Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to several issues:

1. **Handling of Undecided Transitions**: The program attempts to assign 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions ('?') based on the number of scenarios that have already been assigned 'F' or 'S'. However, it does not ensure that the transitions will not exceed the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Assignment**: The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions is flawed. Specifically, the program uses the first \(n // 4 - 1\) elements of `sa` or `sb` to assign 'F' or 'S', which is not a valid strategy to ensure the constraint is met for all permutations.

3. **Symmetry Constraint**: The program does not explicitly ensure that the matrix remains symmetric (i.e., the transition from scenario \(i\) to scenario \(j\) is the same as from \(j\) to \(i\)). While the input guarantees symmetry, the program's logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' might break this symmetry.

4. **Permutation Check**: The program does not check if the resulting transition matrix satisfies the condition for all permutations of scenarios. This is a crucial part of the problem, and the program fails to address it.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Ensuring the matrix remains symmetric.
- Assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions in a way that guarantees no permutation will have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
- Using a more sophisticated algorithm to balance the transitions, possibly involving backtracking or a greedy approach to ensure the constraint is met.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem's requirements.
