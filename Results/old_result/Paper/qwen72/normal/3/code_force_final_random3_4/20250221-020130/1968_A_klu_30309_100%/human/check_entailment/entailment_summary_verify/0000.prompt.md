You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it finds the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) such that the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is maximized. The function returns a list `results` containing these values of `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. The input parameters `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). The issue lies in the `break` statement inside the loop. Once the program finds a `y` that gives a higher sum than the current `max_sum`, it immediately breaks out of the loop without checking other potential values of `y` that might yield an even higher sum. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

For example, consider the input \(x = 10\). The program will start with \(y = 9\), calculate \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\), and then break out of the loop, returning \(y = 9\). However, the correct answer should be \(y = 5\) because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is also the maximum possible sum. The program fails to find this optimal `y` due to the premature `break`.
