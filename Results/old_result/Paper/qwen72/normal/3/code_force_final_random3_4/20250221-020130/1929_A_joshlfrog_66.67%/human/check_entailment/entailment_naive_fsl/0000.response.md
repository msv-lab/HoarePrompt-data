Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The program only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be `2` (as explained in the problem description, the array can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3]` to achieve a beauty of `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`). However, the provided program will output `2` because it computes `max(2, 1, 3) - min(2, 1, 3) = 3 - 1 = 2`, which is coincidentally correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

Consider another input:
```
4
4
3 4 3 3
```
The correct output should be `1` (by rearranging the array to `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, the beauty is `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`). However, the provided program will output `1` because it computes `max(3, 4, 3, 3) - min(3, 4, 3, 3) = 4 - 3 = 1`, which is again coincidentally correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

Now consider a different input:
```
5
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The correct output should be `8` (by rearranging the array to `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`, the beauty is `(5 - 1) + (2 - 5) + (4 - 2) + (3 - 4) = 4 - 3 + 2 - 1 = 8`). However, the provided program will output `4` because it computes `max(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) - min(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 5 - 1 = 4`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
