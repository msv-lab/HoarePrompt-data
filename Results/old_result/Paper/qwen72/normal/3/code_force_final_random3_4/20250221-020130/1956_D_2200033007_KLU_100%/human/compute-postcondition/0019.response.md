Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1, the elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) in `arr` are set to `i`, the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` is appended to `res`, and the function `make_stairs` is called with the argument `i - 1`.**
