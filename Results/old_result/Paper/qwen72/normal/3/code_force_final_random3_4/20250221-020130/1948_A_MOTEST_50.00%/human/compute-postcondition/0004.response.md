Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case, the console screen is cleared, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, if `n` was 1, 'NO' was printed. If `n` was greater than 1, 'YES' was printed followed by a string `ans` constructed as follows: if `n` was even, `ans` contains each of the first `n // 2` letters of `s` repeated twice; if `n` was odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then contains each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of `s` repeated twice.**
