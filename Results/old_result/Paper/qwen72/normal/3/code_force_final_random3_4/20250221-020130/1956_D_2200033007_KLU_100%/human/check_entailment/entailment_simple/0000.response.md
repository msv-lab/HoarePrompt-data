Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations by storing results in `res_dict`.
   - For a single element subarray, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself.
   - For a subarray with more than one element, it tries to split the subarray and compute the maximum sum recursively.
   - The initial value of `res` is set to \((end_index - start_index + 1)^2\), which is a valid upper bound for the sum of a subarray of length \((end_index - start_index + 1)\).
   - The function then iterates over possible split points and updates `res` if a better sum is found.
   - Finally, it considers the cases where the maximum sum can be achieved by including the first or last element of the subarray.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
   - It first computes the maximum sum using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is greater than 0. If not, it returns a single operation to set the element to 1.
   - If the maximum sum is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" and appends the operation to the result list.
   - Otherwise, it tries to split the subarray and recursively find the operations that achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function transforms a subarray into a "staircase" where each element is equal to its index relative to the start of the subarray.
   - It checks if the subarray is already a staircase. If so, it returns.
   - If the subarray length is 1 and the element is not already 1, it sets the element to 1 and appends the operation to the result list.
   - For longer subarrays, it recursively transforms the subarray and appends the necessary operations to the result list.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program uses a divide-and-conquer approach to find the optimal subarray splits and operations.
   - The memoization in `func_1` ensures that the program does not perform redundant calculations, which is crucial for efficiency given the constraints.
   - The `make_stairs` function ensures that the subarray is transformed into a form that maximizes the sum.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles single-element arrays correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the initial array already has a high sum or is in a form that does not require many operations.

7. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \times 10^5\), which is within the allowed limit.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic is sound, and the functions are designed to handle the constraints and edge cases effectively.

Correctness: **True**
