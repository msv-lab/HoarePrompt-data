### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads from standard input, which is a valid approach for handling input in a contest environment.
   - The function processes each line of input as a test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Conditions for Determining 'YES' or 'NO':**
   - The function checks if `x < k - 1`. If this condition is true, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
     - If Sasha can lose at most `x` times in a row and `x < k - 1`, then the maximum number of consecutive losses is less than the number of coins he gains from a single win (since `k - 1` is the net gain from a win).
     - Therefore, if Sasha has at least `x + 1` coins initially, he can always recover from any sequence of losses and eventually win more coins, making it possible to achieve any number of coins.
   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
     - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, then the maximum number of consecutive losses equals the net gain from a single win.
     - To ensure he can recover, Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins initially. This is because he needs to cover the maximum possible loss and still have enough to place a bet that can recover the losses.
   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
     - If Sasha can lose more than `k - 1` times in a row, the function calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee that he can recover from the maximum possible sequence of losses.
     - The calculation of `z` is based on the idea that after `x - k + 3` iterations, Sasha should have enough coins to cover the losses and still have a chance to win more coins.
     - The condition `a >= z` is used to determine if Sasha has enough initial coins to guarantee he can achieve any number of coins.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `x` is very close to `k - 1` or when `a` is very large.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of the function aligns with the problem description and the provided examples. The conditions and calculations are designed to ensure that Sasha can always recover from losses and achieve any number of coins given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, and the conditions and calculations are logically sound.

Correctness: **True**
