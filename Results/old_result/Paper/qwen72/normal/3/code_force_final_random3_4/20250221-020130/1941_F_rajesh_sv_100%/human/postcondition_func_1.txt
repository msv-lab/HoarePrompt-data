The function `wrapper` does not accept any parameters. It checks if the tuple `args` is a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not a key in `d`, it computes the result of `func(*args)`, adds `args` as a key in `d` with this result, and returns the result. If `args` is already a key in `d`, it returns the value associated with `args` in `d`, which is the previously computed result of `func(*args)`.
