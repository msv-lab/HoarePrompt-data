Output State: **`A` is True; `not_c` is False; `arr` remains unchanged; `set_` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the sorted unique elements in `set_`. If the difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `A` toggles between True and False with each iteration. Since `set_` is a sorted list of unique elements starting with 1, and the loop checks the difference between consecutive elements, if there is any gap greater than 1, `not_c` will be set to False. If all differences are exactly 1, `A` will toggle an even number of times, ending up as True. The variables `arr` and `set_` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
