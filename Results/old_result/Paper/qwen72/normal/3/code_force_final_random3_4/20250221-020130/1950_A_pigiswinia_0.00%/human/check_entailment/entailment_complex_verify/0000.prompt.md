You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the loop will have printed 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each of the `t` test cases based on the conditions provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (integers where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`). Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the function prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained, and the program state is unchanged except for the output printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the digits are equal. According to the problem description, if the digits are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation will output "STAIRS" for `0 0 0` because the condition `a < b < c` is evaluated as `0 < 0 < 0`, which is `False`, but the condition `a < b > c` is evaluated as `0 < 0 > 0`, which is also `False`. Therefore, the program will incorrectly output "STAIRS" instead of "NONE". 

To fix this, the conditions should be adjusted to ensure that the digits are not equal when checking for "STAIR" or "PEAK". For example, the conditions should be `a < b and b < c` for "STAIR" and `a < b and b > c` for "PEAK".
