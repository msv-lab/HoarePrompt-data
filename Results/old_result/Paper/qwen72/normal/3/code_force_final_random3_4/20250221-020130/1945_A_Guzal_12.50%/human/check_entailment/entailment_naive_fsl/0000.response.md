Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails in scenarios where the number of extroverts (b) is not a multiple of 3 and the number of universals (c) is insufficient to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts. For example, consider the input:

```
1
1 2 1
```

In this case:
- There is 1 introvert, which requires 1 tent.
- There are 2 extroverts, which require 1 tent with 3 people (since each extrovert needs to be with 2 others).
- There is 1 universal, which is not enough to form a complete tent with the 2 extroverts.

The program will output:
```
3
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
-1
```

This is because it is impossible to form a tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal, as the extroverts need to be with 2 others, and the universal alone cannot fulfill this requirement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
