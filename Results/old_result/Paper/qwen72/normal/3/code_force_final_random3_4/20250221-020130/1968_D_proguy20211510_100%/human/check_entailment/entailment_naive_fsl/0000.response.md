Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are part of the same cycle in the permutation. In such a case, the program will incorrectly compute the scores because it does not account for the possibility that Bodya and Sasha might end up at the same position after a certain number of moves, which would affect their scores and the final outcome of the game.

Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 1 2
2 3 4 1
1 2 3 4
```
- Bodya starts at position 1.
- Sasha starts at position 2.
- The permutation is [2, 3, 4, 1].
- The array a is [1, 2, 3, 4].

In this case:
- Bodya's first move: He moves to position 2 and gains 2 points.
- Sasha's first move: He moves to position 3 and gains 3 points.
- Bodya's second move: He moves to position 3 and gains 3 points (total 5 points).
- Sasha's second move: He moves to position 4 and gains 4 points (total 7 points).

The correct output should be "Sasha" because Sasha has a higher score after 2 turns. However, the provided program will incorrectly compute the scores because it does not handle the cycle correctly.
