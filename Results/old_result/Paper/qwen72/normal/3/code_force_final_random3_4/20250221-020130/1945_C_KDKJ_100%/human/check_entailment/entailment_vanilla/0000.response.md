### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`.
   - `S[i][0]` represents the number of zeros from the start of the string up to the i-th house.
   - `S[i][1]` represents the number of ones from the start of the string up to the i-th house.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road can be built (from 0 to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of zeros on the left side of the road.
     - `lsum`: the total number of houses on the left side of the road.
     - `right`: the number of ones on the right side of the road.
     - `rsum`: the total number of houses on the right side of the road.
   - It checks if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the total houses on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
   - It checks if the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the total houses on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).

4. **Optimal Position Selection**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` to the current position `i` if `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`n / 2`) than the previously stored answer.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `-1` to ensure it gets updated on the first valid position.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the road can be built before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`).

### Analysis:
- The prefix sum calculation ensures that the program can efficiently determine the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road for any position `i`.
- The condition checking ensures that the road is laid in a way that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- The optimal position selection ensures that the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible, and if there are multiple such positions, it selects the smaller one.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all the edge cases and ensures the optimal position is selected based on the given conditions.

### Correctness:
