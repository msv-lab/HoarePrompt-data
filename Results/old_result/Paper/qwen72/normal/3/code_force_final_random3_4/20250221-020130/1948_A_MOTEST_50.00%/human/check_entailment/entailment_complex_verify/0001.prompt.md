You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

Output

    YES
    MM

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case, the console screen is cleared, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, if `n` was 1, 'NO' was printed. If `n` was greater than 1, 'YES' was printed followed by a string `ans` constructed as follows: if `n` was even, `ans` contains each of the first `n // 2` letters of `s` repeated twice; if `n` was odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then contains each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of `s` repeated twice.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It clears the console screen and then reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the user. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed such that if `n` is even, it contains each of the first `n // 2` letters of the uppercase English alphabet repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then contains each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of the alphabet repeated twice. The function executes this process `t` times.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because a special character must have a neighbor, and if it has only one neighbor, it cannot be special.

3. **String Construction:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program constructs a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs the string by repeating each letter from `string.ascii_uppercase` twice, `n // 2` times. This ensures that each repeated letter is a special character because it is equal to its neighbor.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with the string "AAA" (which has 3 special characters) and then constructs the rest of the string by repeating each subsequent letter from `string.ascii_uppercase` twice, `n // 2 - 1` times. This ensures that the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string `ans` if `n` is greater than 1.
   - The program prints "NO" if `n` is 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - The program ensures that the constructed string has at most 200 characters, as required by the problem statement. Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `ans` will be `2 * 50 = 100` characters, which is within the limit.

6. **General Validity:**
   - The program uses the `string.ascii_uppercase` to ensure that it has enough unique characters to construct the string.
   - The logic for constructing the string is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters and that the string length does not exceed 200 characters.

### Correctness:
**True**
