Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the digits are equal. According to the problem description, if the digits are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation will output "STAIRS" for `0 0 0` because the condition `a < b < c` is evaluated as `0 < 0 < 0`, which is `False`, but the condition `a < b > c` is evaluated as `0 < 0 > 0`, which is also `False`. Therefore, the program will incorrectly output "STAIRS" instead of "NONE". 

To fix this, the conditions should be adjusted to ensure that the digits are not equal when checking for "STAIR" or "PEAK". For example, the conditions should be `a < b and b < c` for "STAIR" and `a < b and b > c` for "PEAK".
