You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: 4
    #2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and a list `p_i` of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.

2. **Winning Condition**: The key to solving the problem is understanding the winning condition based on the bitwise XOR of the sequence. The XOR of a sequence of numbers is non-zero if and only if the sequence contains an odd number of 1s, 3s, or both. This is because:
   - \(1 \oplus 3 = 2\)
   - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
   - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
   - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
   - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**: To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible. This can be achieved by removing pairs of 1s and 3s, and single 1s or 3s if necessary.

4. **Calculation**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the maximum number of pairs of 1s and 3s that can be removed, which is given by \(3 \times (x // 2)\) for each \(x\) (count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s).
   - It also considers the remaining single 1s or 3s, which is given by \(x \% 2 \times (i < 3)\). This ensures that only 1s and 3s are considered for the single removals.
   - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

5. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented in the program, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
