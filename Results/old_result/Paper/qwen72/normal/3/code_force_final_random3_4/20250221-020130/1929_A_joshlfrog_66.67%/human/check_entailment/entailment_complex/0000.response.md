Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array. The goal is to maximize this sum by rearranging the elements of the array.

The given program, however, does not attempt to rearrange the elements of the array. Instead, it simply finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints the difference between them. This approach is incorrect because the maximum beauty is not necessarily the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. The beauty of the array is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
2. To maximize this sum, we should try to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.
3. One effective way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This will ensure that the differences are as large as possible.

The given program does not follow this approach and instead prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the correct solution.

Correctness: **False**
