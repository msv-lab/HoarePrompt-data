Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and `t` = 1, `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= `n`, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the key node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= `start` <= `n`, `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves from the `start` node to each leaf node, `n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, t = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to `n` and `t` respectively.
- The initial values of `n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- The other variables (`edges`, `nodes`, `start`, `moves`) are not affected by this code, so their initial states remain valid.
