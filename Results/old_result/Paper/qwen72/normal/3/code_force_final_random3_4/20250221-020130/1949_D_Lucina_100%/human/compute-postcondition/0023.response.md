Output State: **The list `xx` remains unchanged. The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `sa` remains unchanged. The list `sb` now contains the indices of the rows or columns where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0, as well as the indices of the rows or columns where both the count of 'F' and 'S' characters are 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Additionally, the length of `sa` is still less than the length of `sb`. The loop prints the modified rows of `xx` where '?' characters are replaced with 'S' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise.**
