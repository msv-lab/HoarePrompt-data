Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and will solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: In `func_1`, the program calculates a prefix sum array `S` where `S[i]` contains the number of `0`s and `1`s up to the `i`-th house. This is done by iterating through the string `a` and updating the counts accordingly.

3. **Condition Checking**: The program then iterates through all possible positions to place the road (from 0 to `n`), and for each position, it checks if the number of `0`s on the left side and the number of `1`s on the right side meet the required conditions:
   - At least \(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\) `0`s on the left side.
   - At least \(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\) `1`s on the right side.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**: If the conditions are met, the program checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found optimal position `ans`. If it is, `ans` is updated to `i`.

5. **Output**: After processing all possible positions, the program prints the optimal position `ans`.

6. **Test Case Handling**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

The program efficiently checks all conditions and ensures that the road is placed in the optimal position as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
