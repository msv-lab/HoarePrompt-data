### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The function initializes an array `s` of length 30 with binary digits of `x`. This is done by checking each bit of `x` using bitwise AND (`x & pow(2, i)`), and appending '1' if the bit is set, otherwise appending '0'.
   - This step is correct and ensures that the binary representation of `x` is stored in `s`.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints:**
   - The function then iterates over the array `s` to adjust the values to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero values exist.
   - It uses a flag to keep track of whether a carry-over adjustment is needed.
   - If a '1' is followed by another '1', the first '1' is changed to '-1', and the flag is set to 1, indicating a carry-over.
   - If the flag is set and the next bit is '0', the '0' is changed to '1', and the flag is reset to 0.
   - If the flag is set and the next bit is also '1', the current bit is set to '0', and the flag remains 1.
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set, it adjusts the last bit or appends a new bit to handle the carry-over.
   - This logic is mostly correct, but it has a few issues:
     - The flag handling at the end of the array is not robust. If the last bit is '0' and the flag is set, it changes the last bit to '1', which might not be correct if the array needs to be extended.
     - If the flag is set and the last bit is '1', it changes the last bit to '0' and appends a '1', which might not always be the correct adjustment.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The function makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero values exist by checking if a '-1' is followed by a '1'. If so, it changes the '-1' to '0' and the '1' to '-1'.
   - This step is necessary to correct any issues that might have been introduced by the carry-over handling.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the length of the array `s` and the array itself.
   - The length of the array should be recalculated after the adjustments, as the array might have been modified. However, the function does not do this, which can lead to incorrect output lengths.

### Issues:
- **Carry-Over Handling:**
  - The carry-over handling at the end of the array is not robust. If the last bit is '0' and the flag is set, it changes the last bit to '1', which might not be correct if the array needs to be extended.
  - If the flag is set and the last bit is '1', it changes the last bit to '0' and appends a '1', which might not always be the correct adjustment.

- **Final Adjustments:**
  - The final adjustment loop is necessary but could be simplified. The condition `if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')` should be handled more carefully to avoid unnecessary changes.

- **Output Length:**
  - The length of the array `s` is not recalculated after the adjustments, which can lead to incorrect output lengths.

### Conclusion:
The program is **not** entirely correct due to the issues in the carry-over handling and the final adjustments. The logic is close but needs refinement to handle edge cases correctly, especially the length of the output array.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
