### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not implement the logic to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the MEX operation as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning behind the original assessment:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray, but it does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function uses a dynamic programming approach to compute a value that is not related to the MEX operation. Specifically, it calculates a value based on the length of the subarray and the elements within it, but it does not compute the MEX of the subarray and apply it to the elements.
   - The function's logic is flawed because it does not consider the MEX operation at all. It instead uses a recursive approach to maximize a sum that is not based on the MEX.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
   - It relies on the output of `func_1` to determine the sequence of operations, but since `func_1` does not correctly compute the MEX, `func_2` also fails to generate the correct sequence of operations.
   - The logic in `func_2` is based on the incorrect values computed by `func_1`, leading to incorrect operations being generated.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is intended to modify the array `arr` to form a sequence from 0 to `i` and append the corresponding operation to `res`.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the MEX operation. It only sets the elements to `i` and does not compute the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function's logic is also flawed because it does not consider the MEX of the subarray, which is a crucial part of the problem.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  105 2
  3 3
  3 4
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarrays and apply it to the elements.
  - The function `func_1` will compute a value that is not based on the MEX, and `func_2` will generate operations based on this incorrect value.
  - The function `make_stairs` will not correctly set the elements to the MEX of the subarray.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the MEX operation as required by the problem statement. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` do not align with the problem's requirements, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
