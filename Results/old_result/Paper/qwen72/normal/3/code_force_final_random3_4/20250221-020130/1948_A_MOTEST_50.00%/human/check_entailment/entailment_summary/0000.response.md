Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - This matches the problem description.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function prints 'NO' because a string with exactly one special character is impossible (a special character must be equal to one of its neighbors, and with only one character, this is not possible).
   - This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For `n` greater than 1, the function constructs the string `ans`:
     - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating each of the first `n // 2` letters of the alphabet twice.
     - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then repeats each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of the alphabet twice.
   - This approach ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters:
     - For even `n`, each pair of repeated letters (e.g., 'AA', 'BB', 'CC') contributes 2 special characters.
     - For odd `n`, the initial 'AAA' contributes 3 special characters, and the subsequent pairs contribute 2 special characters each, summing up to `n` special characters.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans` for valid cases.
   - This matches the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - The function ensures that the length of the string `ans` does not exceed 200, as required by the problem constraints.

6. **Screen Clearing**:
   - The function uses `os.system('cls')` to clear the console screen. This is not necessary for the correctness of the algorithm but is a minor implementation detail that does not affect the solution's validity.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
