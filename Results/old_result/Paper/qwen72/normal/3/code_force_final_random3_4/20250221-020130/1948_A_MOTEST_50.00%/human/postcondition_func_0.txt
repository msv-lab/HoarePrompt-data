The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It clears the console screen and then reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the user. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed such that if `n` is even, it contains each of the first `n // 2` letters of the uppercase English alphabet repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then contains each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of the alphabet repeated twice. The function executes this process `t` times.
