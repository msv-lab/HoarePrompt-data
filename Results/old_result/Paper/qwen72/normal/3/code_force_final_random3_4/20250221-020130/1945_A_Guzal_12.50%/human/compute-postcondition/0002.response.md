Output State: **a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; n is an input integer. The values of a, b, and c are updated in each iteration based on user input, and k is recalculated in each iteration. After n iterations, the final values of a, b, and c are the ones provided in the last iteration of input, and k is the value calculated in the last iteration.**
