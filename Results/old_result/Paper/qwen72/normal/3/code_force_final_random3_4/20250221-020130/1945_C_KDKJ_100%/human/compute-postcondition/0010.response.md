The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters in its function signature. However, within the function, `n` is an integer representing the number of houses (with the constraint 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function returns a value based on the input string `a`.

Since the function signature does not include these parameters, it is assumed that they are either defined within the function or passed in some other way (e.g., global variables, user input).

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on a string `a` of length `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) consisting only of '0' and '1'.**
