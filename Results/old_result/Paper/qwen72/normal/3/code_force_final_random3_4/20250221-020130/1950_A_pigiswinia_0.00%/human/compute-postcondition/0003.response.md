The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates with an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, it uses digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer `t` and digits `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 <= t <= 1000 and 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
