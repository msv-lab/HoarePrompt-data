Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases by calling `func_3()` and then iterates this number of times, calling `func_6()` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the variable `testcases` remains unchanged, and any variables modified by `func_6()` will reflect their final state after all iterations. The function does not return any value. **
