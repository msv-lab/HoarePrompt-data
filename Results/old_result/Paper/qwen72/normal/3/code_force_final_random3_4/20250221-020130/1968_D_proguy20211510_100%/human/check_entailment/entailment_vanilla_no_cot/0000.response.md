Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha over the turns. Specifically, the way the scores are calculated does not correctly simulate the game's rules. Here are the issues:

1. **Score Calculation Logic**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the score by summing up the values of `a` at the current position and then multiplying by the remaining number of turns. This is incorrect because the score should be incremented by the value at the current position on each turn, not multiplied.
   - The program should simulate the game turn by turn, adding the value at the current position to the score and then moving to the next position based on the permutation.

2. **Cycle Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies cycles in the permutation, but it does not handle the cycle correctly when calculating the score over multiple turns. It should consider the total score accumulated within the cycle and the number of complete cycles that fit into the remaining turns.

3. **Initial Position Handling**:
   - The program should start the score calculation from the initial positions of Bodya and Sasha and then simulate the game for `k` turns.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the cycle for each player's starting position.
2. Calculate the score for the initial segment of the cycle and the total score for one complete cycle.
3. Simulate the game for `k` turns, taking into account the number of complete cycles and the remaining turns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate_game(start, k):
            score = 0
            vis = [0] * n
            curr = start
            path = []
            while not vis[curr - 1]:
                vis[curr - 1] = 1
                path.append(a[curr - 1])
                curr = p[curr - 1]
            
            cycle_start = curr
            cycle_score = 0
            cycle_length = 0
            while True:
                cycle_score += a[curr - 1]
                cycle_length += 1
                curr = p[curr - 1]
                if curr == cycle_start:
                    break
            
            initial_score = 0
            initial_length = 0
            for i in range(len(path)):
                if path[i] == a[cycle_start - 1]:
                    break
                initial_score += path[i]
                initial_length += 1
            
            full_cycles = (k - initial_length) // cycle_length
            remaining_turns = (k - initial_length) % cycle_length
            
            total_score = initial_score + full_cycles * cycle_score
            for i in range(remaining_turns):
                total_score += a[cycle_start - 1 + i]
            
            return total_score
        
        resb = simulate_game(pb, k)
        ress = simulate_game(ps, k)
        
        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the game by handling the initial segment and the cycle separately, and then calculating the total score for each player over `k` turns.
