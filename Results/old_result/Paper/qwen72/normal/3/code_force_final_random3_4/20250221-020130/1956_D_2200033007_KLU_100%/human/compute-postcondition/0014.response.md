Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer (specifically `i - 1`), `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` is now `i - 1`.
- The value of `start_index` remains the same, but the condition `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1` is updated to `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i` because `i` has been decremented.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The list `res` remains unchanged.
- The variable `is_already_stairs` remains False because the condition that at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index` still holds, but the range is now `arr[start_index:start_index + i]`.
- The condition that `i` is not equal to 0 still holds.
- The condition that `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` still holds, but `i` is now `i - 1`.
