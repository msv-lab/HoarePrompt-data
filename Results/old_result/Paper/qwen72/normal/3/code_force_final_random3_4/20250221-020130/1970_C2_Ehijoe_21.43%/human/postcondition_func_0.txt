The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `nodes` representing a tree, an integer `start` representing the starting node, and an integer or `None` `parent` representing the parent node. It returns a list of distances from the `start` node to all other nodes in the tree that are reachable from `start` and not equal to `parent`, incremented by 1. If the `start` node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one adjacent node which is its parent), the function returns a list containing the single element 0. The `nodes` list and the `parent` variable remain unchanged.
