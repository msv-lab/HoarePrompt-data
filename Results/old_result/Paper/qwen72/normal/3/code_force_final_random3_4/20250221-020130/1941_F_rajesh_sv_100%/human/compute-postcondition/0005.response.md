The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 1, as the loop will start with `i = 1`.

State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9. `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. `F` is a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. `F` is now the list returned by `func_4()`. `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
