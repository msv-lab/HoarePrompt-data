Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. It returns 'Alice' if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone or if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all exactly 1. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'. The input list `arr` remains unchanged. **
