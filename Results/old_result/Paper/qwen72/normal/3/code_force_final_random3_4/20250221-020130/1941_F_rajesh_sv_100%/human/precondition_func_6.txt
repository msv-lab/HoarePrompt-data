n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5. A is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9. D is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
