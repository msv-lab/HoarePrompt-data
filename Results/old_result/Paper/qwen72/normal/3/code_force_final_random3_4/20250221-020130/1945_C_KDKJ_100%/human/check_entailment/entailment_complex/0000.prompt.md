Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed in the function signature, but within the function, n is an integer representing the number of houses (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.

    #State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing sublists where each sublist represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point. The final sublist in `S` will be `[count_of_0s, count_of_1s]` where `count_of_0s` is the total number of '0's in `a` and `count_of_1s` is the total number of '1's in `a`.

    for i in range(n + 1):

        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):

    #State: `n` is the same input integer, `a` is the same string consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is the same list containing sublists where each sublist represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point, and `ans` is the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `i` that meets the above criteria.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the given conditions.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`. The function then determines the value of `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n) that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while ensuring that the number of '0's on the left side of the split (up to index `i`) is at least half the length of the left side, and the number of '1's on the right side of the split (from index `i` to the end) is at least half the length of the right side. Finally, it prints this value of `i`. If no such `i` exists, it prints `-1`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used.
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: None of the variables in the function signature are used. 
    #
    #The loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input, and each iteration calls the function `func_1()`. However, since `func_1()` does not modify any variables in the function signature and no variables are used within the loop, the initial state remains unchanged after all iterations of the loop have finished.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer from user input, which determines the number of times it will call the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` is called repeatedly, but since `func_1` does not modify any variables in the function signature of `func_2`, the overall state of the program remains unchanged after `func_2` concludes.
