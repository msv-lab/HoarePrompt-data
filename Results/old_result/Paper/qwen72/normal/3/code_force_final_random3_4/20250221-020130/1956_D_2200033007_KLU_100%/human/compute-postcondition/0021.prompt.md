You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, arr is a list of integers, and res is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in arr.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, `is_already_stairs` is False if any element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`; otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `i` is a non-negative integer (specifically `i - 1`), `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `arr` is a list of integers where the elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) have been set to `i`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` has been appended to `res`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1, the elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) in `arr` are set to `i`, the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` is appended to `res`, and the function `make_stairs` is called with the argument `i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs operations on a list `arr` and a list of tuples `res`, but it does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None.

Case_2: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
