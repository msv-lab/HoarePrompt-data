The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, where each element is `10 ** 9`.

- `ans` is now a list of length `n`, with each element being `10 ** 9`.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` with each element equal to `10 ** 9`.**
