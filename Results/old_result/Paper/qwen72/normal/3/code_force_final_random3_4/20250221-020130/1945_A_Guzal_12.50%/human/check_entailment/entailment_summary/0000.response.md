### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Introverts (a)**:
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent. This is correctly handled by adding `a` to the total number of tents `k`.

3. **Extroverts (b)**:
   - Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two others. This is correctly handled by adding `(b + c) // 3` to the total number of tents `k`, which accounts for the extroverts and the universals that can fill the remaining spots in the tents.

4. **Universals (c)**:
   - Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. The function uses `c` to help fill the tents with extroverts and any remaining spots.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function checks if it is impossible to accommodate the participants by using the condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`. This condition ensures that if there are extroverts that cannot be paired with others (i.e., `b % 3 != 0`), and there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots (i.e., `c < 3`), and the total number of extroverts and universals is not divisible by 3 (i.e., `(b + c) % 3 != 0`), then it prints `-1`.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - The function correctly calculates the total number of tents `k` by adding the number of tents for introverts and the number of tents for extroverts and universals. It also increments `k` by 1 if there are any remaining participants that need a tent.

### Correctness:
- The function handles all the given constraints and edge cases correctly.
- The logic for calculating the minimum number of tents is sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
