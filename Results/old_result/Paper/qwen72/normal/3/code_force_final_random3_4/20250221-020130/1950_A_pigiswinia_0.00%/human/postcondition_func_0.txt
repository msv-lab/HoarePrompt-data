The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (integers where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`). Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the function prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained, and the program state is unchanged except for the output printed to the console.
