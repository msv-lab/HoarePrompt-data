Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, `is_already_stairs` is True.**

The variable `is_already_stairs` is set to `True`, while the other variables (`i`, `start_index`, `arr`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
