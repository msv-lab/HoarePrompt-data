The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop can execute because `range(n + 1)` will include at least one value (0). Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is not yet defined. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing sublists where each sublist represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point, `ans` is -1**
