### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track whether Alice or Bob will win.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes using `set(arr)` and then sorting it.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - If the smallest pile size (i.e., `set_[0]`) is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. Hence, the function returns 'Alice'.

4. **Consecutive Check**:
   - The program then checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. It iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, it toggles the value of `A` one more time.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Initial Check**:
  - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. This is correct.

- **Correctness of the Consecutive Check**:
  - The program checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. If they are not, Alice can always win by choosing a `k` that breaks the sequence, ensuring Bob will be left with a non-consecutive sequence on his turn.
  - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the game essentially reduces to a Nim game with a single pile of size 1, which is a losing position for the player who is forced to play it. The program toggles `A` one more time to account for this, which is correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the pile sizes are consecutive.
  - It also handles the case where the smallest pile size is not 1, which is correctly identified as a win for Alice.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

### Correctness:
**True**
