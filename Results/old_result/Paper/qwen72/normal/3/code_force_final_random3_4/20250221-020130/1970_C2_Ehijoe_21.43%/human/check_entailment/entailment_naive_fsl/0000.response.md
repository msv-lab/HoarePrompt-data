Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the starting node is a leaf node. According to the problem description, if the starting node is a leaf node, the player who starts (Ron) will immediately lose because they cannot make a move. However, the function `func_1` incorrectly returns `[0]` in this case, which means the function `func_2` will incorrectly determine that Ron can win if the starting node is a leaf. For example, if the input is:

```
3 1
1 2
1 3
2
```

The starting node is `2`, which is a leaf node. Ron cannot make a move, so Hermione should win. However, the program will output "Ron" because `func_1` returns `[0]` for the leaf node, and the condition `if any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves])` will be true, leading to the incorrect output.
