Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the input and constructs an adjacency list `nodes` to represent the tree. This is done by iterating over the edges and adding each node to the adjacency list of the other node.

2. **Leaf Node Identification**:
   - The function `func_2` identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one adjacent node) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. This step is not strictly necessary for the problem but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - `func_1` is called with the `nodes` adjacency list and the `start` node. This function computes the distances from the `start` node to all leaf nodes, which is essential for determining the winner of the game.
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the base case where the `start` node is a leaf node by returning `[0]`.
   - For non-leaf nodes, it recursively calculates the distances to all leaf nodes, incrementing the distance by 1 for each step.

4. **Game Outcome Determination**:
   - After computing the distances, `func_2` checks if there is at least one odd number in the list `moves`. If there is, it prints 'Ron', indicating that Ron can make a move that leaves Hermione with no valid move. If all numbers are even, it prints 'Hermione', indicating that Hermione can always make a move that leaves Ron with no valid move.
   - This logic is correct because in a tree, if the distance to any leaf node is odd, the player who starts (Ron) can always force the other player (Hermione) into a position where they have no valid move. Conversely, if all distances are even, the player who starts (Ron) will eventually be forced into a position where they have no valid move.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem specifies that the tree has at least 2 nodes, and the input constraints are handled correctly by the functions.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and input constraints.

Correctness: **True**
