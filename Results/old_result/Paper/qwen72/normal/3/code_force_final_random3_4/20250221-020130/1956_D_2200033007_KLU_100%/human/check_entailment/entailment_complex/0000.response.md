### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing a specific operation up to \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming (memoization) to store and reuse results for subarrays.
   - For a single element subarray (`start_index == end_index`), the maximum value is the maximum of 1 and the element itself.
   - For a subarray with more than one element, it recursively splits the subarray and tries to maximize the sum by considering different splits and the MEX value of the subarray.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the optimal operations.
   - If the subarray is already optimal (i.e., its maximum value is equal to the square of its length), it returns a single operation to set the entire subarray to its MEX value.
   - Otherwise, it recursively splits the subarray and constructs the operations for each split.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is used to transform a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where each element is set to its index.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired pattern.
   - If not, it recursively sets the elements to the MEX value and appends the operation to the result list.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the input, initializes the result dictionary, and calls `func_1` to compute the maximum sum.
   - It then calls `func_2` to construct the sequence of operations.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the MEX value for the subarray. It uses a heuristic that is not guaranteed to find the correct MEX value.
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The function `func_1` splits the subarray in a way that does not always lead to the optimal solution. The logic for splitting and combining results is flawed.
- **Missing `start_index` in `make_stairs`**: The function `make_stairs` is called without passing `start_index` as an argument, which is necessary for the function to work correctly.
- **Infinite Recursion**: The recursive calls in `func_1` and `func_2` might lead to infinite recursion if the base cases are not correctly handled.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect MEX calculation and the flawed splitting logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: **False****
