The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` from the input, then constructs a dictionary `nodes` representing a graph where each key is a node and each value is a list of its adjacent nodes based on the input edges. It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one adjacent node) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. The function then reads an integer `start` from the input, calls `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` to compute a list of integers `moves` representing the number of moves from the start node to each leaf node. Finally, it prints 'Ron' if at least one element in `moves` is an odd number, otherwise it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `edges` is still an empty list, `nodes` contains the adjacency information of the graph, `start` is the input start node, `moves` contains the number of moves from the start node to each leaf node, and `leaves` is a deque containing all leaf nodes.
