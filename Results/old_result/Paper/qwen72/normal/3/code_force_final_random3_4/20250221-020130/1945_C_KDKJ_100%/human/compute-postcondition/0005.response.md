Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing sublists where each sublist represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point. The final sublist in `S` will be `[count_of_0s, count_of_1s]` where `count_of_0s` is the total number of '0's in `a` and `count_of_1s` is the total number of '1's in `a`.**
