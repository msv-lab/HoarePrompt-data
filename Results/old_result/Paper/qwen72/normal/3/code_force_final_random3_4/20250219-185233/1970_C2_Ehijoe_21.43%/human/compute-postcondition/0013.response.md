Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements, and `v` has been appended to `nodes[u]` again. `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as an additional element.**

Explanation:
- The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`.
- The values of `u` and `v` are now the input integers.
- The other variables and conditions (`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` including each other as elements) remain unchanged.
