Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with the key 'a' mapped to `char`, `decoded` is an empty list, and `c` is 97.**

### Explanation:
- **`encoded`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`char`**: This variable also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`mapping`**: The loop iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. The first time it finds a character that is not already in the values of `mapping`, it adds that character to `mapping` with `char` as its value and then breaks out of the loop. Since `mapping` starts empty, the first character 'a' will be added to `mapping` with `char` as its value.
- **`decoded`**: This list remains empty because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`c`**: The loop breaks after the first iteration where `chr(c)` (which is 'a') is added to `mapping`, so `c` will be 97, which is the ASCII value of 'a'.
