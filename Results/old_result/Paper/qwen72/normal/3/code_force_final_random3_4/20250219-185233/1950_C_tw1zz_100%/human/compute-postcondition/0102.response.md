Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59, `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, and `m1` is equal to `m`. If `h` is '21', `h1` is set to '09' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '22', `h1` is set to '10' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '23', `h1` is set to '11' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.***
