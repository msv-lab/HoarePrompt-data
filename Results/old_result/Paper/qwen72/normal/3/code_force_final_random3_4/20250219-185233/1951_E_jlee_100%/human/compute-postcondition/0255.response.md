Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, `count2` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1. If `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False. Otherwise, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
