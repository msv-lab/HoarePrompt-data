Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` is a list that includes `v` three times, `nodes[v]` is a list that includes `u` three times.**

The code `nodes[v].append(u)` adds the integer `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` included `u` twice, so after the code execution, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` three times. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
