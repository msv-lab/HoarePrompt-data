Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `d.get(i) == None`, `d[i]` is set to 1 and `i` is added to `pl`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `pl` now includes the third element in `palka` as an additional element if it was not already in `pl`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `pl.append(i)` adds the third element of the list `palka` (which is `i`) to the list `pl`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, and `palka` remain unchanged.
- The dictionary `d` and the list `pl` are updated based on the initial conditions. If `i` was not already a key in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.
- The list `pl` now definitely includes `i` as an additional element if it was not already present.
- The variable `shapes` remains unchanged and is not affected by the code.
