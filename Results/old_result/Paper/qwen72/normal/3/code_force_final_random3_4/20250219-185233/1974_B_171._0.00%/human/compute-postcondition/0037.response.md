Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, and `c` is the ASCII value of the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values, or 123 if all lowercase Latin letters are already in `mapping` values. If the first lowercase Latin letter that is not present in `mapping` values is found, `mapping` is updated such that this letter maps to `char`, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `encoded` string remains unchanged.
- The `char` variable remains the second character in `encoded`.
- The `decoded` list remains unchanged.
- The `c` variable will be the ASCII value of the first lowercase letter (from 'a' to 'z') that is not present in the values of `mapping`, or 123 if all lowercase letters are already in `mapping` values.
- The `mapping` dictionary will be updated with the first lowercase letter that is not present in its values, mapping it to `char`, and the loop will break. If all lowercase letters are already in `mapping` values, `mapping` will remain unchanged.
