Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is equal to `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`**

Explanation:
- `lsum` is assigned the value of `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`.
- Since `i` is 0, `lsum` is equal to `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `left` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions and the new value of `lsum`.
