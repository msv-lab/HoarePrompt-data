The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'1 2'`. The initial state describes the values of `t`, `i`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **1 2**
