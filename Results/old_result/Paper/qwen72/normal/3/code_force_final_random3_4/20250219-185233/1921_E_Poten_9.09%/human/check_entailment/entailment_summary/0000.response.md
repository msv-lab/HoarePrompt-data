Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the six integers representing the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Conditions and Edge Cases**:
   - The function checks if Alice's chip is already in a position where she cannot move (i.e., `x_a > x_b` or `h == 1`). In such cases, it correctly appends 'Draw' to the `answers` list.
   - The function also handles the case where Alice and Bob are in the same column at the start. If both `x_a` and `x_b` are on the same parity (both even or both odd), Bob wins if they are in the same column. Otherwise, Alice wins.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The function then proceeds to check the relative positions of Alice's and Bob's chips to determine the outcome.
   - It correctly handles the scenarios where Alice's and Bob's chips are in different columns and calculates the number of moves required for them to potentially meet.
   - The function uses the absolute difference in the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates to determine if the chips can meet within the board boundaries.

4. **Draw Conditions**:
   - The function correctly identifies scenarios where the game ends in a draw. This happens when the chips cannot meet within the board boundaries or when the number of moves required for them to meet is such that they will not intersect.

5. **Win Conditions**:
   - The function correctly identifies scenarios where Alice or Bob wins. Alice wins if she can force Bob into a position where he cannot avoid a collision, and Bob wins if he can force Alice into a similar position.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case after processing all of them, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified conditions and edge cases, and it produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
