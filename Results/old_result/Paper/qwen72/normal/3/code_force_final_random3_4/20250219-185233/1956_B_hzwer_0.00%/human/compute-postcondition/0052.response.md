Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, and `j` is -1. The `dp` table has been fully updated for all values of `j` from `n - 1` down to 0, based on the conditions in the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `n - 1` down to 0.
- For each iteration, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be -1 because the loop runs until `j` is -1 (the loop condition is `j >= 0`).
- The `dp` table will have been updated for all values of `j` from `n - 1` down to 0, and the values will reflect the maximum values based on the conditions specified in the loop.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `cards` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
