Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair from the elements of `arr`, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs `(a % x, a % y)` that were encountered before the current element in the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values.
- The `arr` list is fully iterated through, and each element has been processed.
- The `results` list contains the final value of `count`.
- The `freq` dictionary contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair found in `arr`.
- The `count` variable is updated to reflect the total number of times a pair `(a % x, a % y)` was encountered before the current element in the loop. This means `count` will be the sum of the frequencies of all pairs that were seen before each element in `arr` was processed.
