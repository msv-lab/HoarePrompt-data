Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and the value `factor` is yielded.**

Explanation:
- `prime_to_i` is initially 1 and is multiplied by `prime`, which is equal to `primes[k]`. Therefore, `prime_to_i` is now equal to `prime`.
- The values of `k`, `rest`, `prime`, `factors[prime]`, and the yielded value `factor` remain unchanged.
