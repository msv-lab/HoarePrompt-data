Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list` + (len(rev_val) - 1), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, and the condition is not met.**

Explanation:
- The code `list_len, max_power = input().split()` updates the values of `list_len` and `max_power` based on the input string.
- `list_len` is assigned the first part of the input string.
- `max_power` is assigned the second part of the input string.
- All other variables remain unchanged, including `y`, `operational_list`, `x`, `x_rev`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, and the condition.
