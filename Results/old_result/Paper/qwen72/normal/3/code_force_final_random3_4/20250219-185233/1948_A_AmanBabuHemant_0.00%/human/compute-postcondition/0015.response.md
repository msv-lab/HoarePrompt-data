Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `_`, or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.**

The initial state is updated with the new value of `n` based on the input. The conditions regarding `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The conditions for `s` are only applicable if `n` is even, and the length of `s` is determined by the value of `n // 2`.
