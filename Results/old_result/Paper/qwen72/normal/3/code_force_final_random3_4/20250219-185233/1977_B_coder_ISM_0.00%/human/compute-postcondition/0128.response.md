Postcondition: ***`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1' and `s[2]` is '1', then `s[1]` is '-1' and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', then `s[1]` is changed to '1' and `flag` is 0. If neither of these conditions is met, `s` remains unchanged and `flag` retains its original value.***
