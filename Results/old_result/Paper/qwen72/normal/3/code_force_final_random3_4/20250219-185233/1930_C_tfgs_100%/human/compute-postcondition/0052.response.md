The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `adv` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `j` will be 2 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `adv` must be greater than 2.

State: **`adv` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `ans` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[i - 1] - 2`**
