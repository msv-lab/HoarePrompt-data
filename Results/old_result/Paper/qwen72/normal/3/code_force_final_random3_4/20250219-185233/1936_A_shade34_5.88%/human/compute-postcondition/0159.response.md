Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
