Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray. The provided functions aim to achieve this goal through a combination of dynamic programming and recursive backtracking.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.
   - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store and reuse results for subarrays, which helps in optimizing the solution.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, where it returns the maximum of 1 and the value at `arr[start_index]`. This is because the MEX of a single-element subarray is either 1 (if the element is 0) or the element itself (if it is greater than 0).
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it considers different splits and calculates the maximum sum by recursively calling itself on the subarrays and adding the MEX of the current subarray. The MEX is calculated as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It first checks if the subarray length is 1. If the single element is greater than 0, no operation is needed. If it is 0, the operation is to set the element to 1.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it checks if the maximum value of the subarray is equal to the square of the subarray's length. If so, it returns a single operation that sets the entire subarray to the MEX.
   - Otherwise, it recursively divides the subarray into smaller segments and combines the results of these recursive calls to ensure the sum of the maximum values of these segments equals the maximum value of the original subarray.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is intended to modify the array to form a "staircase" pattern, where the elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i`.
   - It checks if the subarray already forms a staircase. If it does, it returns without making changes.
   - If the subarray does not form a staircase, it recursively sets the elements to `i` and appends the corresponding operation to `res`.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the MEX. It assumes the MEX can be derived from the length of the subarray squared, which is not accurate. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
- **Recursive Splitting in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` attempts to split the subarray and find the correct operations, but it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. It should be based on the actual MEX of the subarray, not just the length.
- **`make_stairs` Function**: This function is not used correctly in the context of the problem. It seems to be intended to set a subarray to a specific value, but it does not align with the MEX operation described in the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The MEX calculation and the recursive splitting logic need to be revised to ensure they align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
