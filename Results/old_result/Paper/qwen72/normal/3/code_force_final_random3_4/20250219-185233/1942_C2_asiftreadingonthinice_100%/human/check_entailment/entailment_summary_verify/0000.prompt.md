You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Program:
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for ii in range(tt):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = x + y - 2
        tmp = []
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
                tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1

            tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        tmp.sort()
        for i in tmp:
            if y >= i - 1:
                ans += i
                y -= i - 1
            else:
                break
        ans += y
        print(min(ans, n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers `a` within the range [1, n]. It calculates the minimum number of operations needed to ensure that the difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `a` is at least 2, using the value of `y` to perform additional operations if necessary. The function prints the result of this calculation, which is the minimum of `ans` (the calculated number of operations) and `n - 2`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The program does not handle the case where the chosen vertices are not in a contiguous block. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
8 4 2
1 3 6 8
```

In this case, the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 3, 6, and 8. The program will sort these vertices and then calculate the gaps between them. However, the logic for handling the gaps and adding vertices to maximize the number of triangles is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the gaps between the vertices and the additional vertices that can be added to form triangles.

The program will output 6, but the correct output should be 5. Here's why:

- The vertices 1, 3, 6, and 8 form the following gaps:
  - Gap between 3 and 1 (considering the polygon is cyclic): 2
  - Gap between 6 and 3: 3
  - Gap between 8 and 6: 2
  - Gap between 8 and 1 (cyclic): 3

- The program will try to add vertices to these gaps to maximize the number of triangles. However, the logic for adding vertices and calculating the number of triangles is not correct, leading to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to more carefully handle the gaps between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices that can be added to form triangles without intersecting diagonals.
