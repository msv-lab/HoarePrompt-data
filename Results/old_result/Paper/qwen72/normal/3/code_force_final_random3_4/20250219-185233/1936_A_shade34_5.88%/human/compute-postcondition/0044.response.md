Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `_` has completed its iterations, which means any loop or process involving `_` has finished.
   - The output buffer has been flushed, meaning any pending output has been written.
   - `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<`.
   - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is not `<` or `=`, and `s` is the new user input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The string `'?'` is a constant and will be printed as is.
   - `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak2` is again equal to `mak`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order.
   - Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the value of `mak2` will be the same as `mak`.

Given the initial state, the values of `mak` and `mak2` are either the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given. The value of `i` is 2.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak] (where [mak] is the highest value of i for which the user input was '<' or 0 if no such input was given)**
