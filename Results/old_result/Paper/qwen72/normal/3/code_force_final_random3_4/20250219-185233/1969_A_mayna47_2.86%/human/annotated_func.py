#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be defined to accept input parameters for the number of test cases t, the number of friends n for each test case, and the list of best friends p for each test case. However, the provided function definition `def func_1():` does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of integers (1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, all p_i are distinct).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n`, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` at any iteration, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program completes the loop and returns nothing.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *The function definition `def func_1(t, test_cases):` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is an input integer. The variable `v` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. The values of `t` and `test_cases` are not affected. If `n` is 2, the program does not modify `v` and returns nothing. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is set to `n`, and the program iterates from `i` down to 0. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` at any iteration, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program completes the loop and returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user input and a list of integers `v` of length `n`. It then checks if `n` is 2, in which case it prints 2 and returns. If `n` is greater than 2, it iterates through the list `v` and checks if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. If this condition is met at any point, it prints 2 and returns. If the condition is never met, it prints 3 and returns. The function does not modify any external variables or parameters and always returns nothing.
