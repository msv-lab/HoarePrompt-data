You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
        
    #State: `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `1 + t * (1 + n)`, where `n` is the sum of the values of `n` for each iteration. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations. `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration. `a` is a list of `n` integers for the last iteration, starting from the element at index `idx - n - 1` in `data`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing all the results from `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, and the loop has printed each result in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases, producing output based on the input.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
