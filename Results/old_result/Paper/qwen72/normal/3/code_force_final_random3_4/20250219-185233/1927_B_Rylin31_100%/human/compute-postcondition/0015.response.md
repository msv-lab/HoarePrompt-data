To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - For each test case, a valid string `s` exists.
   - `l` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at each index `j` in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`, and all other elements are 0.
   - `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element.
   - `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `array` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `s` is a list of length `l` where each element at index `j` in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`.
   - `ans` is a string where each character is determined by converting the value `s[j] + 97` to its corresponding ASCII character for each `j` in `array`.

3. **Steps to Determine `ans`**:
   - Initialize `s` as a list of zeros of length `l`.
   - For each element `j` in `array`, increment the value at `s[j]` by 1.
   - Construct `ans` by converting each `s[j] + 97` to its corresponding ASCII character.

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose `array = [0, 1, 0, 2]` and `l = 3`.
   - Initialize `s` as `[0, 0, 0]`.
   - For `j = 0`, increment `s[0]` by 1: `s = [1, 0, 0]`.
   - For `j = 1`, increment `s[1]` by 1: `s = [1, 1, 0]`.
   - For `j = 0` again, increment `s[0]` by 1: `s = [2, 1, 0]`.
   - For `j = 2`, increment `s[2]` by 1: `s = [2, 1, 1]`.
   - Now, construct `ans`:
     - For `j = 0`, `s[0] = 2`, so `ans += chr(2 + 97) = 'c'`.
     - For `j = 1`, `s[1] = 1`, so `ans += chr(1 + 97) = 'b'`.
     - For `j = 0` again, `s[0] = 2`, so `ans += chr(2 + 97) = 'c'`.
     - For `j = 2`, `s[2] = 1`, so `ans += chr(1 + 97) = 'b'`.
   - Therefore, `ans = 'cbcb'`.

5. **General Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print a string where each character is determined by the value `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`.
   - The exact characters will depend on the values in `array` and the length `l`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string containing characters corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`)**
