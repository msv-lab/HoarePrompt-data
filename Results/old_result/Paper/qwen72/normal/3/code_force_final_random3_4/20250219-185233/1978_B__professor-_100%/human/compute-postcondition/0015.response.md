Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 but one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `t`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `t`.
- Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made to `t`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to user-provided values.
   - The value of `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output.
   - The print statement calculates the value of the expression `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)` and prints it.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `2 * b - n + 1`: This is a linear combination of `b` and `n`.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This multiplies the result of the linear combination by `n`.
   - `// 2`: This performs integer division by 2, which means the result is truncated to the nearest whole number towards zero.
   - `int(...)`: This ensures the result is an integer.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The expression `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)` will be evaluated based on the values of `b` and `n`.
   - Since the exact values of `b` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the integer value of the expression \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\), where `b` and `n` are the values provided by the user.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) (where b and n are the values provided by the user)**
