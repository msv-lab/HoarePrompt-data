Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` is updated to include tuples from the loop operations, `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements, which are the remaining elements after all iterations of the loop, `v1` and `v2` are the last values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the loop condition fails, and if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` before the loop condition fails.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing `v1`. `p2` is an empty list if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`. `ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple. `v1` and `v2` are the values from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements. `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop condition fails.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing `v1` and the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. `p2` is an empty list if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`. `ops` is a list that must contain at least two tuples. `v1` and `v2` are the values from the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements. `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop condition fails.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `p1` now contains the initial elements of `vx` plus `v1`. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `p2` now contains `v1` and the last element of `p1` is still equal to `v2`. `p2` remains an empty list if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`. `ops` is a list that must contain at least three tuples. `v1` and `v2` are the values from the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements. `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop condition fails.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
