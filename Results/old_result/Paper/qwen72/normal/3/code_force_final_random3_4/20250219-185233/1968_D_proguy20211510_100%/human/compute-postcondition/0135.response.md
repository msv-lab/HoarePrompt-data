Postcondition: ***`vis` is a list where the element at index `ps - 1` is now 1, and all other elements remain 0. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `pb - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again, `paths` is a list containing the elements `a[ps - 1]` and `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the loop or if statement that this `break` statement is inside has been exited. Otherwise, the loop continues.***
