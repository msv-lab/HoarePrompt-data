Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `i` is 2. If `ar[1]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 3 and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `minn` is 1, and `num` is updated to the value at index 1 of `ar`.**
