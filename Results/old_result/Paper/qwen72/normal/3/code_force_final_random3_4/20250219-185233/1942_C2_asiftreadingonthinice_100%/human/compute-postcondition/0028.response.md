Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 2 + k` where `k` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is 2, and `tmp` is a list containing the values `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is an even number but not 2. Additionally, the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2.**
