Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. It then runs a loop `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. For each set of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the function prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After `t` iterations, the function completes and the program returns to the state it was in before the function was called. **
