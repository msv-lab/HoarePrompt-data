Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` > 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.**

Explanation:
- `eta_ln` is assigned the value of the length of the list `eta`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`, and `eta` remain unchanged.
- The length of `eta` is the number of unique integers in the list `w` that are in the range 0 to `n`, since `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, and `eta` contains all indices `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0. Therefore, `eta_ln` is the count of these unique integers.
