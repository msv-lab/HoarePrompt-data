Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is 0, and `best` is the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`).
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, and `total` is updated based on the condition. If `v` ≤ `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` > `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` > `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either the cost to change at position -1 in `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is lower, and `best` remains the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user. If `v` ≤ `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` < `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. If `best` > `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is set to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. If `v` > `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers input by the user. If `v` ≤ `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` < `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` before the code execution, otherwise `best` remains unchanged. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` ≥ `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` remains unchanged. If `v` > `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` < `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
