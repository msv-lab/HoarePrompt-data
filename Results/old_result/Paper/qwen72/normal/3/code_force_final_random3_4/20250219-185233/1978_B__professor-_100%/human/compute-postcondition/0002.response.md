The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer, assigning them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and this state is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
