To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.

2. **Conditions for `h1` and `time`:**
   - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '04' to '11', `h1` is the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

Let's analyze the possible values of `h1` and `time` based on the value of `h`:

- If `h` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', `h1` will be the same as `h` and `time` will be 'AM'.
- If `h` is '12', `h1` will be '12' and `time` will be 'PM'.
- If `h` is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `h1` will be the corresponding hour in 12-hour format (i.e., `h1` will be `h - 12`), and `time` will be 'PM'.
- If `h` is '00', `h1` will be '12' and `time` will be 'AM'.
- If `h` is any other value, `h1` and `time` will both be empty strings.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement will concatenate `h1`, ':', `m`, ' ', and `time` without any separators.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `s` is "01:30", then `h` is '01' and `m` is '30'. According to the conditions, `h1` will be '01' and `time` will be 'AM'.
  Output: **01:30 AM**

- If `s` is "12:45", then `h` is '12' and `m` is '45'. According to the conditions, `h1` will be '12' and `time` will be 'PM'.
  Output: **12:45 PM**

- If `s` is "15:20", then `h` is '15' and `m` is '20'. According to the conditions, `h1` will be '03' (since 15 - 12 = 3) and `time` will be 'PM'.
  Output: **03:20 PM**

- If `s` is "00:00", then `h` is '00' and `m` is '00'. According to the conditions, `h1` will be '12' and `time` will be 'AM'.
  Output: **12:00 AM**

- If `s` is "24:00" (which is not a valid input as per the format "hh:mm"), then `h` is '24' and `m` is '00'. According to the conditions, `h1` and `time` will both be empty strings.
  Output: **:00**

### General Output:
Based on the given conditions, the output will be in the format:
- **h1:m time** where:
  - `h1` is the hour in 12-hour format based on the conditions.
  - `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
  - `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions.

If the hour part `h` does not match any of the conditions (i.e., `h` is not in the range '00' to '23'), `h1` and `time` will both be empty strings, resulting in an output of `:m`.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format based on the conditions, m is the minute part of the input string s, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions)**
