Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 but one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `t`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `t`.
- Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made to `t`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `b - a`**:
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `b - a` will be 0 or a negative number.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, `b - a` will be a positive number.

2. **Calculate the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`**:
   - This expression calculates the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers. If `b - a` is 0 or negative, the sum will be 0.
   - If `b - a` is positive, the sum is the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers, which is a triangular number.

3. **Calculate the expression `a * n`**:
   - This is simply the product of `a` and `n`.

4. **Combine the results**:
   - The final expression is `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
   - This will be an integer value.

### Output Determination:
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` will be 0, so the output will be `a * n`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` will be the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers, and the output will be the sum of this value and `a * n`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the integer value of the expression \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n\).

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n) (where `b - a` is the difference between `b` and `a`, and `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`)**
