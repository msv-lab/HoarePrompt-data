The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `k` and `b` to its current value. Since `ans` was initially 0, the new value of `ans` will be `k * b`. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `k` <= min(`n`, `b`), 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `ans` is `k * b`.**
