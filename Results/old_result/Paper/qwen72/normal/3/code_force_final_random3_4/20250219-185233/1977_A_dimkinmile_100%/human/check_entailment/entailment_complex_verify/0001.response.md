### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the final number of cubes.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the final number of cubes, which is necessary because Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves he has made.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the logic within `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case, and it processes the input values `n` and `m` correctly.
   - The conditions `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` are correctly implemented and logically sound for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
