Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
   - `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement will execute regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, or `done`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a constant string, the output will be exactly `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
