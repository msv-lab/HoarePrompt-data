Output State: **The loop control variable `_` has completed its iterations, `n` remains an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that equals `<` at any iteration, `mak` is set to the highest value of `i` for which this condition was true. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop control variable has finished its range from 1 to `n-1`. The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially, being an integer greater than 0. The value of `i` is the last value it took in the loop, which is `n-1`. The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration. The value of `mak` will be the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If the user never inputs `<`, `mak` will remain 0.
