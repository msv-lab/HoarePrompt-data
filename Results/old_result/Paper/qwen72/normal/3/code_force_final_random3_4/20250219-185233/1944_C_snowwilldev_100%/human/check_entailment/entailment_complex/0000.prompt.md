Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

# Annotated Program:
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: The list `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and now contains each unique integer `a_i` from the list `a` as keys with their respective values being the count of how many times each integer appears in the list `a`, `i` is `N-1`, `N` is the size of the list `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `N`. `t` is the count of unique integers in the list `a` that appear exactly once, and it is less than 2. If `t` reaches 2 or if `cnt[i]` is 0 for any `i` during the loop, the loop returns the value of `i` at that point. If the loop completes without `t` reaching 2 or encountering a `cnt[i]` that is 0, the final value of `i` is `N` and `t` is the count of unique integers that appear exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers `a` of size `N`, where each integer `a_i` is in the range (0 ≤ a_i < N). The function counts the occurrences of each integer in the list using a `defaultdict`. It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` and returns the first integer `i` that either appears exactly once in the list or is missing from the list, provided that no more than one other integer has appeared exactly once before `i`. If no such integer is found, the function returns `N`.
