Reasoning:  
The program aims to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) for each test case. Let's analyze if this approach is correct:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is a key factor in the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). For \( y = x // 2 \):
   - If \( x \) is even, \( y = x // 2 \) is exactly half of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = y \).
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x / 2 \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) (since \( y \) is not a divisor of \( x \)).

2. **Maximizing the Expression**: 
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) gives \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), so \( \gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2y \). This is the maximum possible value because any other \( y \) less than \( x // 2 \) would result in a smaller \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) gives \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + y \). This is the maximum possible value because any other \( y \) less than \( x // 2 \) would result in a smaller \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

3. **Test Cases**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 5 \) and \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \) and \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 10 \) and \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 50 \) and \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \) and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 500 \) and \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \) and \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

The program's approach of setting \( y = x // 2 \) is correct for both even and odd \( x \) because it ensures that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
