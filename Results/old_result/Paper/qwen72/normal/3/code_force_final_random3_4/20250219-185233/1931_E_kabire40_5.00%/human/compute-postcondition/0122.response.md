Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings with at least one element, `x` is the last element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different string length compared to their original string length, and `rev_res` is a string containing the elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same string length as their original string length, concatenated together.**

Explanation:
- `y` remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `int(input())` remains a positive integer greater than 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `operational_list` is a list of strings and is not modified within the loop.
- `x` is the last element of `operational_list` after the loop has completed all iterations.
- `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`.
- `rev_val` is a list that contains the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different string length compared to their original string length.
- `rev_res` is a string that contains the elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same string length as their original string length, concatenated together.
