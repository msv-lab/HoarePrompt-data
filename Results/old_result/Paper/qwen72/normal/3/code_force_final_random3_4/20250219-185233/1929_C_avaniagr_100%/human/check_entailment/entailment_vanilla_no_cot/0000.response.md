Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `x < k - 1` Case:**
   - The program checks if `x < k - 1` and then prints "YES" if `a >= x + 1` and "NO" otherwise.
   - This logic is incorrect because if `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win by placing a bet of 1 coin each time. He will never lose more than `x` times in a row, and each win will increase his coins by `k - 1` times the bet amount. Therefore, he can always guarantee to win any number of coins if `x < k - 1`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `x == k - 1` Case:**
   - The program checks if `x == k - 1` and then prints "YES" if `a >= x + 2` and "NO" otherwise.
   - This logic is also incorrect. If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can still guarantee to win any number of coins if he starts with at least 2 coins. The correct condition should be `a >= 2`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `x > k - 1` Case:**
   - The program uses a loop to calculate `z` and then checks if `a >= z`.
   - The logic for calculating `z` is not correct. The correct approach should be to determine if Sasha can always recover from a series of losses and still guarantee a win. The correct condition for this case is more complex and should involve checking if Sasha can always recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

- If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win by placing a bet of 1 coin each time.
- If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins if he starts with at least 2 coins.
- If `x > k - 1`, Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins if he starts with at least `x + 1` coins.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            print('YES')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
  - Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin and win, so he can always guarantee to win any number of coins.
- **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
  - Sasha needs at least 2 coins to guarantee a win. If he starts with 1 coin, he can lose it and not be able to place any more bets.
- **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
  - Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to guarantee a win. This is because he can lose up to `x` times in a row, and after that, he will win and recover his losses plus gain additional coins.

This corrected program will correctly determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins for all test cases.
