Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - The value of `h1` and `time` depends on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', `h1` is set to the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (i.e., '01' for '13', '02' for '14', etc.), and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is neither '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', nor '00', `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

   - The `sep=''` parameter in the `print` function means that there will be no spaces or other characters separating the arguments.
   - The `print` statement will concatenate `h1`, `':', `m`, `' '`, and `time` into a single string.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The output will depend on the value of `h` in the string `s`.
   - Let's consider a few examples to understand the output better:

   - If `s` is "01:30":
     - `h` is '01'.
     - `h1` is '01'.
     - `m` is '30'.
     - `time` is 'AM'.
     - Output: **01:30 AM**

   - If `s` is "12:45":
     - `h` is '12'.
     - `h1` is '12'.
     - `m` is '45'.
     - `time` is 'PM'.
     - Output: **12:45 PM**

   - If `s` is "13:15":
     - `h` is '13'.
     - `h1` is '01'.
     - `m` is '15'.
     - `time` is 'PM'.
     - Output: **01:15 PM**

   - If `s` is "00:00":
     - `h` is '00'.
     - `h1` is '12'.
     - `m` is '00'.
     - `time` is 'AM'.
     - Output: **12:00 AM**

   - If `s` is "24:00" (which is not a valid input as per the precondition):
     - `h` is '24'.
     - `h1` remains an empty string.
     - `m` is '00'.
     - `time` remains an empty string.
     - Output: **:00**

Given the precondition and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where [h1] is the 12-hour format hour corresponding to [h], [m] is the minute part of the input string, and [time] is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of [h])**
