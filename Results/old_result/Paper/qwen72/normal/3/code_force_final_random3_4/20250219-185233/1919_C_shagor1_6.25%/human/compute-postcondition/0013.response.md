Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is the first element in the list `inp`, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element in the list `inp`, and `a` is greater than `n + 1`. The comparison `x == y` is False.**
