The code snippet `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` updates the value of `l` to the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.

Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\)
- `i` is 2
- `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must not be a power of 2 plus \(2^{(p - 1)}\)
- `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix
- `p` is the length of `l`
- `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\)
- `f` is \(k - 2^{(p - 1)}\) and must not be a power of 2

The code updates `l` to the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix. The binary representation of `f` is calculated and stored in `l`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must not be a power of 2 plus \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `p` is the length of the original `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is \(k - 2^{(p - 1)}\) and must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**
