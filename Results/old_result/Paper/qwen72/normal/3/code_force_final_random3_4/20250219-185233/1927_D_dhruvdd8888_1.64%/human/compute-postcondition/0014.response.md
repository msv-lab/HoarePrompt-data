To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `N`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop uses `i` as the iteration variable, and it is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

2. **Variable `N`**: The loop condition is `i in range(N + 1)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `N` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N + 1`. Since `i` is now 1, `N` must be at least 0 for the loop to continue (because `1 < N + 1`).

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, and `nums` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. However, we should still include their current states in the final answer.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`; otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.**
