Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to construct a sequence where each element is the maximum number that can be represented with the bit length of `k` minus one, and then it assigns the remaining value to the last element. However, this approach does not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Bitwise OR Maximization**:
   - The function `func_1` sets each element of the sequence to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`. This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the function will set both elements to `3` (binary `11`), and then add the remaining `2` to the last element, resulting in the sequence `[3, 2]`. However, the sequence `[5, 0]` (binary `101` and `0`) would also satisfy the conditions and have more 1s in the bitwise OR.

2. **Handling Remaining Value**:
   - The function adds the remaining value `k` to the last element, which can lead to incorrect results if the remaining value is large enough to change the bitwise OR significantly.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence, you should:
1. Distribute the bits of `k` across the sequence such that each bit is set in at least one element.
2. Ensure that the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    bit = 1
    while k > 0:
        if k >= bit:
            nums[0] |= bit
            k -= bit
        else:
            nums[1] |= k
            k = 0
        bit <<= 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = 1
            k -= 1
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Approach:
1. **Distribute Bits**:
   - Start with the least significant bit and set it in the first element if possible.
   - If the bit cannot be set in the first element (i.e., `k < bit`), set the remaining value in the second element.
   - Continue this process for all bits of `k`.

2. **Ensure Sum**:
   - After distributing the bits, if there is any remaining value, distribute it among the elements to ensure the sum equals `k`.

This approach ensures that the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized while maintaining the sum constraint.
