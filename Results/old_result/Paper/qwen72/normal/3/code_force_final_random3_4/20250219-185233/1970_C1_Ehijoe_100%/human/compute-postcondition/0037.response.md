Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` (`s`) and the first element in the list `nodes[s]` (`prev`), `prev` is now equal to the first element in the list `nodes[s]` (`curr`), `curr` is now the second element in the list `nodes[curr]`.**

Explanation:
- `curr` was initially the first element in the list `nodes[s]`.
- The code `curr = nodes[curr][1]` updates `curr` to the second element in the list `nodes[curr]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
