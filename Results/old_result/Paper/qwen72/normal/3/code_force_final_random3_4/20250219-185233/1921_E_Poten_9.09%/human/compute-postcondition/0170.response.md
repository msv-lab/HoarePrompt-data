Output State: **`answers` is a list that must have at least `test_cases` strings ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the last string in the `answers` list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `answers` list must contain at least as many strings as the value of `test_cases`. The variable `j` will be the last string in the `answers` list, which is the string corresponding to the last test case. The initial state of `i` and `clues` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
