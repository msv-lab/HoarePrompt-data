Let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
2. `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
3. `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
4. `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`.
5. `j` is 1.
6. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
7. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
8. Either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This is a list of integers provided by the user. The exact values and length of `a` are not specified, but we know it contains integers.
2. **List `cntl`**: This list has a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is the maximum integer in `a`. Each element at index `i` in `cntl` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`.
3. **`cntl[0]`**: This element is not equal to 0. This means that the integer 0 appears at least once in the list `a`.
4. **`c`**: This is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`. Since `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` will be 1.
5. **`j`**: This is initialized to 1.
6. **`n`**: This is the maximum integer in the list `a` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
7. **`cntl[j]`**: The current value of `cntl[j]` (where `j` is 1) is less than 2. This means that the integer 1 appears either 0 or 1 times in the list `a`.
8. **Condition**: Either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`. Since `c` is 1, `j` must be equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `j` is 1 and `j` must be equal to `n`, it follows that `n` must be 1. Therefore, `j` is 1.

### Output:
The code prints the value of `j`, which is 1.
Output: **1**
