Output State: **`minn` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and `minn`, `maxx` is 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` (which is either 0 or 1) is appended to the list `mex`.
- The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `maxx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, `minn` is 1, `mex` contains 0 and 1, and `maxx` remains 0.
- If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, `minn` is 0, `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and 0, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if it is greater than 0, otherwise `maxx` remains 0.
