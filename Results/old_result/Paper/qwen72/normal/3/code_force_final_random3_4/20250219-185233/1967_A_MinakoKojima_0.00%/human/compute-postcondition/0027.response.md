Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0 initially. If `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`, `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is set to 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, and `ans` is set to `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, with `i` being `n-1`.***
