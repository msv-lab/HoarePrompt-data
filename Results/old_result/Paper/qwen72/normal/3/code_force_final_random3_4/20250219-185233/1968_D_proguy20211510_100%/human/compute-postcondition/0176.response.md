Output State: **`i` is 1, `paths` must have at least two elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[1]`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The list `paths` still has at least two elements.
- The value of `curr` is still `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`.
- The value of `pres` is still `pres + paths[1]`.
- `ress` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr`. Since `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, and `pres` is `pres + paths[1]`, the new value of `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * k`.
