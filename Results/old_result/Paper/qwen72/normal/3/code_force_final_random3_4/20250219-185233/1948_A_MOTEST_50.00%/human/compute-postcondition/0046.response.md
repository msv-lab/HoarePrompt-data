Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `ans` is 'AA' + 'BB', `x` is 1, `j` is 1.**

The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `x` in the string `s` (which is 'B') twice. Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AA' + 'BB'. The other variables remain unchanged.
