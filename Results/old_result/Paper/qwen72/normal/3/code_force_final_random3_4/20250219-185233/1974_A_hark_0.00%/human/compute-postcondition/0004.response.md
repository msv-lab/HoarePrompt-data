Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, and `func_2()` has been called.** 

The code snippet `func_2()` simply calls the function `func_2()`, which has already been called according to the initial state. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, and no new variables are introduced or modified. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
