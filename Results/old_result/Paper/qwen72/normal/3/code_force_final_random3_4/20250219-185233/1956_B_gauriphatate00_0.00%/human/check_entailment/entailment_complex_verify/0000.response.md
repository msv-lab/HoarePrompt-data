Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - The function correctly uses the `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of cards you have (`pairs`).
   - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This is a correct approach because:
     - You can only score points for pairs of cards that you have.
     - You can only play `n // 2` turns optimally, as Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - The logic ensures that you are not overestimating your score, as Nene will always play the card that minimizes your points if she has a choice.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - The input handling is correct, and it correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and the logic for determining the maximum number of points you can get.
   - It considers the optimal play by both you and Nene, ensuring that the result is accurate for all test cases.
   - The program does not have any logical errors or off-by-one issues that would affect the correctness of the solution.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly solves the problem as described.

Final: **True**
