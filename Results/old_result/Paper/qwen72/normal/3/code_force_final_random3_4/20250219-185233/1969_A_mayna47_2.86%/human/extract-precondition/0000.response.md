Precondition: **The function should be defined to accept input parameters for the number of test cases t, the number of friends n for each test case, and the list of best friends p for each test case. However, the provided function definition `def func_1():` does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of integers (1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, all p_i are distinct).**
