The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, where `n` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The function generates a string of uppercase Latin letters that contains exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should not exceed 200 characters. If such a string can be generated, the function returns the string; otherwise, it returns "NO".
