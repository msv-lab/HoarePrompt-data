The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop depends on the value returned by `int(input())` to determine how many times it will iterate. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented by 1.

However, the value of `int(input())` is not stored in a variable and is re-evaluated each time the loop condition is checked. Therefore, `_` is not a state that is modified in the loop head; it is simply the loop variable that increments automatically.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `int(input())` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be 2.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2**
