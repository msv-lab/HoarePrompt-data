The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases where each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and is provided in the input. The function returns the result for each test case, which is likely a matrix of size `n` or some computation based on `n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function returns the result of some computation or matrix generation based on `n` for each test case.**
