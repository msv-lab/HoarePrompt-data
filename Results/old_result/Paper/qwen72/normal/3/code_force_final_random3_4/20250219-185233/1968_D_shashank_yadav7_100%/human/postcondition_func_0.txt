The function `func` reads multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their movements and the values in the permutation `p` and array `a`. The function then prints the result of the game for each test case: 'Bodya' if Bodya's maximum score is greater, 'Sasha' if Sasha's maximum score is greater, and 'Draw' if their scores are equal. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
