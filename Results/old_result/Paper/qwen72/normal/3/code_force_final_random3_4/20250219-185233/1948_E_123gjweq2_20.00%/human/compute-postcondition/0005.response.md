Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`, `i` is 0, `arr[left]` is `left + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + i] = small_element + i` modifies the array `arr` at the index `left + i`.
- Given that `i` is 0, the index `left + i` simplifies to `left`.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`, and `i` is 0, so `small_element + i` simplifies to `left + 1`.
- Therefore, `arr[left]` is assigned the value `left + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
