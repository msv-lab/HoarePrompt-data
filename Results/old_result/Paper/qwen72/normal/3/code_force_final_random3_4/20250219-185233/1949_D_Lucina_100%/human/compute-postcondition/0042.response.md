Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `x` is a new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x` as its last element, `j` is 1, and the second character of `x` is not 'F'. If the first character of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of `b[1]` remains unchanged.***
