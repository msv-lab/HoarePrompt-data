Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed.
2. `trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining elements that were not used, and `trumps` must not be empty.
3. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`trumps` List**: Since `trumps` is a sorted list and it must not be empty, it contains at least one element. The elements in `trumps` are the remaining ranks that were not used.
2. **`trump` Variable**: The variable `trump` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. We can infer that `trump` is one of the suits ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') that is designated as the trump suit.
3. **`trumps.pop()` Method**: The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element of the list. Since `trumps` is sorted, the last element will be the highest remaining rank in the list.
4. **First `trumps.pop()` Call**: This will remove and return the highest remaining rank in `trumps`.
5. **Second `trumps.pop()` Call**: This will remove and return the second highest remaining rank in `trumps`.

### Output Calculation:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return the highest remaining rank in `trumps`.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return the second highest remaining rank in `trumps`.
- Each rank will be concatenated with the `trump` suit.

### Example:
If `trumps` is `[2, 3, 4, 5]` and `trump` is 'H', then:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return `5`.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return `4`.
- The output will be `5H 4H`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `trumps` and `trump` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given information.

Output: **[highest remaining rank in trumps][trump] [second highest remaining rank in trumps][trump] (where [trump] is the designated trump suit and [highest remaining rank in trumps] and [second highest remaining rank in trumps] are the highest and second highest elements in the sorted `trumps` list, respectively)**
