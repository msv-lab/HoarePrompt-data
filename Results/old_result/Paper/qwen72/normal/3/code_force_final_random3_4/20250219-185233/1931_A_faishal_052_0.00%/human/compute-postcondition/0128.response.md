The only variables in the loop head are `k` and the `range` value, which is 3. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` being less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The `range` value remains 3, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `range` is 3, `lex` is the same as before, and `arr` is sorted in ascending order**
