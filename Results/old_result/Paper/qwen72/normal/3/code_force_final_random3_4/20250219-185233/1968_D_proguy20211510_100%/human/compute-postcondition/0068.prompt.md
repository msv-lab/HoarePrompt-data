Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is the final index in the sequence of `p` that leads back to a previously visited index, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `ps - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except those indices that have been visited, which are set to 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is the final index in the sequence of `p` that leads back to a previously visited index, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `ps - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except those indices that have been visited, which are set to 1, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0, `pathb` must have at least 1 element. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is the final index in the sequence of `p` that leads back to a previously visited index, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `ps - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except those indices that have been visited, which are set to 1, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 1, `pathb` must have at least 2 elements. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is the final index in the sequence of `p` that leads back to a previously visited index, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `ps - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except those indices that have been visited, which are set to 1, `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 2, `pathb` must have at least 3 elements. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
