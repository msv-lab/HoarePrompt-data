The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since no variables are passed to the function `func_2`, we need to ensure that the input provided by the user is a positive integer.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
