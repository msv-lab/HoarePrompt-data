Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is `1 + (x - 1)`, `max_sum` is `1 + (x - 1)`, `best_y` is 1, and the current value of `current_sum` is greater than the current value of `max_sum`.**

The code updates `max_sum` to the value of `current_sum`, which is `1 + (x - 1)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
