Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, arr = test_cases[i]` updates the values of `n` and `arr` to the first and second elements of the tuple at index `i` in `test_cases`.
- Since `i` is 1, `n` and `arr` are now set to the first and second elements of the second tuple in `test_cases`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` remain unchanged, except for `n` and `arr` which are updated as described.
- The new `median_index` is calculated as `n // 2` based on the new value of `n`.
- The new `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the new `arr`.
- The `heap` is still a min-heap containing elements from the new `arr` starting from the new `median_index` to the end, where all elements are greater than the new `current_median`.
- The `operations` variable remains the same as it was not affected by this code snippet.
