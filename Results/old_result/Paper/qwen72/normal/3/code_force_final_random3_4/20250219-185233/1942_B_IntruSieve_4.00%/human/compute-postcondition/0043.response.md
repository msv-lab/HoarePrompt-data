Output State: **`minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers that has been fully iterated, `i` is `n - 1`, and `itm` is the last element in `mex`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `minn` remains unchanged as it was initially set.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was initially set.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially set.
- The list `mex` has been fully iterated, meaning all elements in `mex` have been printed.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set.
- The variable `itm` holds the last element of the `mex` list, which was the last value printed in the loop.
