The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `3` to `n + 1` (exclusive), so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `i` must still be less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented to 3 (since the loop starts from 3)
- `n` must be such that `i` is less than `n + 1`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 3**
