Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (which is 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`. `t` is now an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    print(x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers where each integer is the result of converting the corresponding string from the initial `arr` list to an integer, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`. `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 2` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the first `x` strings in the original `arr`, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 3` and `t` must be at least 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `y` is the third integer from the new input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
