Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is the value of `freq[rx, ry]` added to the previous `count` value, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`, and the tuple `(rx, ry)` is a key in the dictionary `freq`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.
- The previous values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `freq`, `a`, `rx`, and `ry` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `count` is the sum of the previous `count` value and the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.
