Output State: **The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The variable `rank` is assigned the rank of the next card from the input, and the variable `suit` is assigned the suit of the next card from the input. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`, except for the key `suit` which is now set to `rank`. If the previous `suit` was equal to `trump`, the list `trumps` contains the rank of the first card, and the list `answers` is empty. Otherwise, the list `trumps` is empty, and the list `answers` is either empty or contains a single string which is the result of joining the sorted list of `suits[previous_suit]` and `previous_rank` with a space, and appending the `previous_suit` to each element. The key `previous_suit` in the dictionary `suits` is either `None` or set to `previous_rank`. The list `input().split()` must have at least one more element, and `card` is the next element in this list.**
