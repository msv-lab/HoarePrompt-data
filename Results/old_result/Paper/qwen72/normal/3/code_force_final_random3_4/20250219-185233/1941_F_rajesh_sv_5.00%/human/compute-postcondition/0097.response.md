The variables in the loop head are `l` and `h`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `l < h`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`, and `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. It is also given that `l` must be less than `h`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must still be less than `h` after the previous iteration. Since the loop body updates `l` or `h` based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, the new values of `l` and `h` must still satisfy `l < h`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `l` is still less than `h` after the update. The specific values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` will be recalculated based on the new `l` and `h`.

State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`, `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
