The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `start_index`, and the array `arr`, along with the value `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop head will evaluate the next time.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`.
- `j` is initialized to `start_index`.
- `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.

The loop head is `for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1)`. This means that `j` starts at `start_index` and will increment by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `start_index + i`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `start_index + i + 1`.

Given that `j` is initialized to `start_index` at the start of the loop, after the first iteration, `j` will be `start_index + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is greater than 0, `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`, `j` is `start_index + 1`, `arr[j]` is equal to `i`**.
