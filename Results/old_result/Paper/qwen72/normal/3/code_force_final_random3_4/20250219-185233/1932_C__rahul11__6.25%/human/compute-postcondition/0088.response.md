Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`. Since `c` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, `res[c]` is now the next element in the `res` list and is set to the same value as `res[c-1]`, which is `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
