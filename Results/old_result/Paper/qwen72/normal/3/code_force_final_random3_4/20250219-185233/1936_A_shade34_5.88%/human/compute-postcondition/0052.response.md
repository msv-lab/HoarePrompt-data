Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains an input integer greater than 0, `_` has completed its iterations, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing the values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` if no `=` inputs were given.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop control variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The input integer `n` remains the same as it was initially, and it is still greater than 0.
- The loop has finished executing, so the loop control variable `_` has completed its iterations.
- The output buffer has been flushed, ensuring that all printed outputs have been displayed.
- `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, or it remains 0 if no such input was given.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`, as it was set to the same value as `mak` at the start and is updated whenever `mak` is updated.
- `pans` is a list that contains the values of `i` for which the user input was `=`, or if no `=` inputs were given, it contains the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If no `<` or `=` inputs were given, `pans` will be an empty list.
