Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `x` remains 0, `y` is set to `nums[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `nums[1]`.
- The value of `x` remains 0 because the code snippet does not change it.
- All other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, `i`) retain their initial values or conditions.
