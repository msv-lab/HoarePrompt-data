Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -3 or decreased by 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
