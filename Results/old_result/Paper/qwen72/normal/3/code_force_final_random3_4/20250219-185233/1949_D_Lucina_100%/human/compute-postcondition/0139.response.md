Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at position 0 in `xx[1]` concatenated with the character at position 0 in `xx[1][0]`. Otherwise, if `xx[1][1]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at position 0 in `xx[1]` followed by 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or followed by 'S' otherwise. If `xx[1][1]` is '?', `nx` is 'FF' if `n` is 8 or more, 'SF' if `n` is less than 8, 'FS' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'SS' otherwise.***
