Initial State: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `i` is 1

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y`, which are both input integers. The exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, so we can only describe them as the input integers provided by the user.

Output: **x, y (where x and y are the input integers provided by the user)**
