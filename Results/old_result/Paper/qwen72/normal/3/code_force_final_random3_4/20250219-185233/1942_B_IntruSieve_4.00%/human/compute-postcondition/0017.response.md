Postcondition: ***`minn` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `maxx` is 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 0. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, `minn` is 1, `mex` contains 0, and `maxx` remains 0. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, `minn` is 0, `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if it is greater than `maxx` (which is 0), otherwise `maxx` remains 0.***
