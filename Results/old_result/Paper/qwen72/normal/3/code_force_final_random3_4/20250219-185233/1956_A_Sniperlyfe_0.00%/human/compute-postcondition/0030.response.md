Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains greater than 1.
- The values of `k` and `q` remain as the input integers they were initially.
- The list `p` remains unchanged as the list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `qs` remains unchanged as the list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `res` now contains the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, in the order they appear in `qs`.
