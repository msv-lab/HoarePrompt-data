Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**

The value of `y` is updated to 4, as `i` is 2 and `y` is calculated as `i * i`. The values of `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
