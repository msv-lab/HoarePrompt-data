The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer, and the function is expected to handle multiple test cases where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already defined to be within a range that ensures it is greater than 0, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an input integer, and the function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
