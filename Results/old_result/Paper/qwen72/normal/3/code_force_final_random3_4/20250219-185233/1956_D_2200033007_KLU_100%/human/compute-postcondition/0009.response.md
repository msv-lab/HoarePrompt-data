Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 2, and `i + 1` must be greater than 2. `is_already_stairs` is False.**

The value of `is_already_stairs` is explicitly set to False, and the other conditions and variables (`i`, `j`, and the requirement that `i + 1` must be greater than 2) remain unchanged. The condition about the element at index `start_index + j` in the array `arr` being not equal to 1, which would set `is_already_stairs` to False, is no longer relevant since `is_already_stairs` is now explicitly False.
