The variables in the loop head are `heap[0]` and `current_median`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, and `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, and `current_median` is the median value of the sorted array, the loop can execute again if the smallest element in the heap is less than or equal to the median value.

Given that `heap` is a min-heap and contains elements starting from index `median_index + 1` to the end of `arr`, plus the value `smallest + 1`, and `smallest` is the value of `current_median`, the smallest element in the heap should be `smallest + 1` (i.e., `current_median + 1`). For the loop to execute again, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `heap[0]` is `current_median + 1`, the loop will not execute again unless `heap[0]` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `current_median`. However, we cannot directly modify `heap[0]` as it is derived from the heap's structure. Instead, we need to ensure that the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` holds true by adjusting `current_median` to be greater than or equal to `heap[0]`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `current_median` to be greater than or equal to `heap[0]`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `heap[0]`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` + 1 to the end, plus the value `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the value of `current_median`**
