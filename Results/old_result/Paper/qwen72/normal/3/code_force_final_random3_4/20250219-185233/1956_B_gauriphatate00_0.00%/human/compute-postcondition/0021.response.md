Output State: **`func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `4 + n + n`. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than the new value of `_`. `n` is now assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx - n - 1` in `data`. `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`. `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` updates the list `a` to contain `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx` in `data`.
- The values of `func_2`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is still the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is now `_ + 1`.
- The new list `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx - n - 1` in `data`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`.
- `idx` is assigned the value `4 + n + n`.
- `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than the new value of `_`.
- `n` is now assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx - n - 1` in `data`.
- `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
