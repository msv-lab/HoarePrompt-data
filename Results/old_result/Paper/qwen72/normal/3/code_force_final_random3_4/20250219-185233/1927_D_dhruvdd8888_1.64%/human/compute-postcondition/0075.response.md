To determine what will be printed by the `print(l, r)` statement, let's analyze the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` and `r` are updated to new input integers.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `tc > 5`.
   - `ppp` is either 23 or not 23.

2. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `l` and `r` are explicitly mentioned as new input integers. Therefore, their values are not determined by any formula or condition in the initial state; they are directly provided as inputs.
   - `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. However, the values of `eli` and `LA` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `s` and `e`.
   - `tc` is a condition that is greater than 5, but it is not directly relevant to the `print(l, r)` statement.
   - `ppp` is either 23 or not 23, but it is also not directly relevant to the `print(l, r)` statement.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(l, r)` statement will print the values of `l` and `r`.

Since `l` and `r` are updated to new input integers, their exact values are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe their values as new input integers.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are new input integers)**
