Output State: **`v3` is assigned the value returned by `q(0)`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1` and `v3`, `v1` and `v2` are now assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `len(vx)` is now greater than 1. If `v2` > 0, `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1` and `v3`, `ops` is a list that includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. `v1` and `v3` have been removed from `vx`.**
