Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Check**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". This is correct because a string with an odd number of special characters cannot be constructed where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is due to the nature of the special character requirement, which implies a pairing of special characters (e.g., "AA" or "CC").

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "110" `n // 2` times. This is a valid approach because each "110" pattern contributes exactly 2 special characters (the first and second '1' are special, while the '0' is not).

4. **String Length Check**: The program then checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". This check is necessary because the problem specifies that the length of the string should not exceed 200 characters.

5. **Edge Case**: The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2. For `n = 2`, the string "MM" is a valid solution, and the program will generate "110" which is also valid.

6. **General Case**: For any even `n`, the string "110" repeated `n // 2` times will always have exactly `n` special characters and will not exceed 200 characters, as the maximum value of `n` is 50, and `50 // 2 = 25`, which means the maximum length of `s` is `25 * 3 = 75` characters, well within the 200-character limit.

7. **Output Format**: The program adheres to the required output format, printing "YES" followed by the string if a valid string is found, and "NO" otherwise.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
