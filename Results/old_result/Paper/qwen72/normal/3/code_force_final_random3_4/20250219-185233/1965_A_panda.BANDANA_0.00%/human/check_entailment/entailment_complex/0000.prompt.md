Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function should be able to process an input t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        e = set(l)
        
        m = len(l)
        
        if 1 in l:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements of `l`, and `m` is the length of `l`. If 1 is in `l`, the set `e` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in `e`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, the function checks if the list contains the integer 1. If 1 is present, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program includes the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` as described in the annotations, but these variables are not returned or further used. The function's primary purpose is to determine and print the winner ("Bob" or "Alice") for each test case based on the presence of the integer 1 in the list of stones.
