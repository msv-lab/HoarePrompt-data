Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `results` is a list containing at least two results from `func_1(n, a)`.
   - `result` is the second result in the list `results`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `result`.
   - According to the initial state, `result` is the second element in the list `results`.
   - Since `results` contains at least two results from `func_1(n, a)`, `result` will be the value returned by the second call to `func_1(n, a)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The exact value of `result` depends on the specific values of `n` and `a` used in the second call to `func_1(n, a)`.
   - Without knowing the exact values of `n` and `a`, we can only describe `result` as the second result from the list `results`.

Output: **result (where result is the second result in the list `results` from the function `func_1(n, a)`)**
