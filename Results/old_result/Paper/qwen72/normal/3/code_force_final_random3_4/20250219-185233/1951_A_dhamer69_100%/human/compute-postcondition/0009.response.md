Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer with a current value of 2, and `s` is an input string. If `s` is '00', the program performs the actions specified in the if part. If `s` is not '00', the program performs the actions specified in the else part.*** 

(Note: Since the if and else parts do not specify any changes to the variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition, with the addition of the conditions based on the value of `s`.)
