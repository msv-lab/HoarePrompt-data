Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. The issue lies in the way the `mapping` dictionary is being populated and used. The program attempts to map each character in the encoded string to a character that has not yet been used in the `mapping` dictionary, but this approach does not follow the symmetric replacement rule described in the problem.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create the auxiliary string r with distinct characters in alphabetical order
    r = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Create a mapping from characters in r to their symmetric counterparts
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Creating the Auxiliary String `r`**:
   - `r` is created by taking the set of distinct characters from the encoded string and sorting them alphabetically.
   
2. **Creating the Symmetric Mapping**:
   - A dictionary `mapping` is created where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart. The first character in `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
   
3. **Decoding the String**:
   - The encoded string is decoded by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary.

This corrected program will correctly decode the string as per the problem's requirements.
