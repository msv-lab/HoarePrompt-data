Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `j` is the second element of `pl`, `shapes` is now `shapes` + (`d[j]` // 3).**

Explanation:
- The value of `shapes` is incremented by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3.
- If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.
- If `d[j]` is less than 3, `shapes` remains unchanged.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
