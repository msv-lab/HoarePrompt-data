Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3 or 4, `same` is 1 or 2, `num` is equal to the element at index `i` in `ar`, and `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same`.
- Since `same` is either 1 or 2, and `minn` is already the minimum of its previous value and 1, `minn` will be 1 if its previous value was greater than 1, or it will remain the same if its previous value was already 1 or less.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
