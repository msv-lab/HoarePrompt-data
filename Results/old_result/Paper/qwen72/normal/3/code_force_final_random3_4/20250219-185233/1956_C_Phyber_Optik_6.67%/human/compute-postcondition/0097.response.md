To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498
- `n` is at least 1
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `n + r`
- `r` is either 0 or 1
- `sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
4. **Check Loop Condition**: After incrementing `i`, the loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 2) is less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must still be at least 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` is now 2).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is either 0 or 1, and `sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`**
