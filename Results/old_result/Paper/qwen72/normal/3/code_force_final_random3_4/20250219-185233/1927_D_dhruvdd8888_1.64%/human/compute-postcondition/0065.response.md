Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0.
2. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user.
3. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
4. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.
5. `tc > 5`.
6. `ppp` is either 23 or not 23.
7. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
8. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `eli`**:
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. This means `eli` is the position in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` fits based on the sorting criteria of `arr`.

2. **Determine `min(eli, LA)`**:
   - `LA` is the length of the list `arr`.
   - `min(eli, LA)` will be the smaller of `eli` and `LA`. If `eli` is within the bounds of the list, it will be used; otherwise, `LA` will be used, which is the last valid index in the list.

3. **Determine `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - Therefore, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`, and `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(s - 1, s)` will print the value of `s - 1` followed by the value of `s`.

### Final Output:
- Since `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, the print statement will output `s - 1` and `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`)**
