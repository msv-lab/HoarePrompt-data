Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This value is not directly used in the code snippet.
   - `i` is 2. This value is not directly used in the code snippet.
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as the integer result of `x` divided by 2. This means `y` will be the floor division result of `x` by 2, i.e., `y = x // 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.

Output: **y (where y is the integer result of x divided by 2)**
