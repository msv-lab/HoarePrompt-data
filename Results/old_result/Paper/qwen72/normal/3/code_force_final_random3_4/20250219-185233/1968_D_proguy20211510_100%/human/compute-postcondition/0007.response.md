Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer greater than 0, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `a`. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
