Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is incremented by 1, the values of `ans`, `res[c-1]`, `l`, and `r` are updated based on the condition of `s[k]`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, and `res[c-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `ans`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The values of `res[c]` and the updates to `ans` and `l` or `r` based on the condition of `s[k]` are still valid but now refer to `res[c-1]` since `c` has been incremented.
