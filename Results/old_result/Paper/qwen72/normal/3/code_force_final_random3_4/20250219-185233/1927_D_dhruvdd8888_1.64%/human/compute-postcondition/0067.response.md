Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0.
2. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user.
3. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
4. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.
5. `tc > 5`.
6. `ppp` is either 23 or not 23.
7. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
8. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
- The values of `s` and `e` are not used in the `print` statement.
- The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print `-1` and `-1` regardless of the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
