Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
2. `n` is a positive integer.
3. `i` is `n + 1`.
4. `j` is 1.
5. `r` is `n`.
6. `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
7. The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so each integer in the sequence will be printed separated by spaces.

### Variables:
- `n` is a positive integer, which means `n` can be any integer greater than 0.
- The range `1, n + 1` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the positive integer n)**
