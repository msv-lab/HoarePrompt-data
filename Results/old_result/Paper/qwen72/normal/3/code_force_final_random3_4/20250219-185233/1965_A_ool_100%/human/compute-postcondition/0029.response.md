Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The function determines the winner of a game based on the unique values in `arr` and their differences. If the smallest unique value in `arr` is not 1, the function returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the differences between consecutive unique values are all 1. If they are, the function toggles the value of `A` an even number of times, resulting in `A` being False, and returns 'Bob'. If any difference is greater than 1, `A` is toggled an odd number of times, resulting in `A` being True, and the function returns 'Alice'. **
