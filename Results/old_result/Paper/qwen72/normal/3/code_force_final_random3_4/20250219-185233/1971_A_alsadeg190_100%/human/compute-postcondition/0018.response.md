Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `x-1`, and `x` must be greater than 0. If `x` < `y`, the values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, and `i` also remain unchanged.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `x-1`, which is the last index in the range `0` to `x-1`. The values of `x` and `y` will be the last inputs provided during the loop's execution. The condition `x < y` or `x >= y` will have been checked for each iteration, but the values of `x` and `y` will not have been modified by the loop. The only change is that `i` will have incremented to `x-1`, indicating that the loop has run `x` times.
