### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He wants to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle must be different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle in terms of its dimensions (considering rotations).

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - To form a new rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) must be even. This is because:
     - If \( a \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
     - If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle with dimensions \( 2 \times \frac{a \cdot b}{2} \) or \( \frac{a \cdot b}{2} \times 2 \), which will be different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle.

3. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No".

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies whether at least one of the dimensions is even.
   - If either dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd dimension will result in non-integer dimensions, and the only possible cuts will result in rectangles that are the same as the original when considering rotations.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( a \) and \( b \) are both 1 (which is the smallest possible rectangle and cannot be cut).
   - It also handles the case where \( a \) or \( b \) is 2, which is the smallest even dimension and can be cut to form a new rectangle.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - Each test case consists of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle.
  - The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases \( t \) is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

- **Inside the function:**
  - `t = int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
  - `for _ in range(t)`: Iterates over each test case.
  - `a, b = map(int, input().split())`: Reads the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \) for the current test case.
  - `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`: Checks if either dimension is even.
  - `print('Yes')`: If at least one dimension is even, prints "Yes".
  - `else: print('No')`: If both dimensions are odd, prints "No".

- **State of the program after the loop:**
  - `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
  - `_` is `t-1` (the loop variable).
  - `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
  - The program does not modify `a` or `b` after reading them.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given dimensions \( a \times b \). The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
