Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'. `res` is the input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**
