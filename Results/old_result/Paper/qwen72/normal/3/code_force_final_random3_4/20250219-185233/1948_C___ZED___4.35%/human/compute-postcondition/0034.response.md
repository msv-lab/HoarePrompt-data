To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `k` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character '>'.
   - `k` is the last even number less than `n` + 2, plus 2.
   - `no_path` is False if `a[k]` is not '>', otherwise it remains True.

2. **Calculation of `k`:**
   - First, we need to find the last even number less than `n` + 2.
   - To find the last even number less than `n` + 2, we can use the formula: `last_even = (n + 1) if (n + 1) % 2 == 0 else n`.
   - Then, we add 2 to this last even number to get `k`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n` is 5.
   - `n + 2` is 7.
   - The last even number less than 7 is 6.
   - Adding 2 to 6 gives `k = 8`.

4. **General Case:**
   - For any `n` greater than 2, `n + 2` will be an integer greater than 4.
   - The last even number less than `n + 2` will be `n + 1` if `n + 1` is even, or `n` if `n + 1` is odd.
   - Adding 2 to this last even number will always give an even number `k` that is 2 more than the last even number less than `n + 2`.

5. **Final Value of `k`:**
   - If `n` is even, `n + 2` is even, and the last even number less than `n + 2` is `n`.
   - Therefore, `k = n + 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n + 2` is odd, and the last even number less than `n + 2` is `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `k = n + 3`.

Since `n` is an input integer greater than 2, the value of `k` will be:
- `n + 2` if `n` is even.
- `n + 3` if `n` is odd.

Thus, the `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k` based on the above conditions.

Output: **k (where k is n + 2 if n is even, or n + 3 if n is odd)**
