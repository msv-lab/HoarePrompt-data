Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 200,000, or if any integer in the list is less than 0 or greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns an error message. Otherwise, the function processes the list and returns a specific output for each test case.**
