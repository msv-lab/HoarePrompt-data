Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1`, `i` is 1, `x` is `n`, `y` is 1.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
- Since `x` is `n` and `y` is 1, `math.ceil(n / 1)` is `n` because dividing `n` by 1 and taking the ceiling of the result does not change `n`.
- `n % 1` is always 0 because any integer divided by 1 has no remainder, so `(n % 1 == 0)` evaluates to 1.
- Therefore, `cnt` becomes `-1 + n + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
