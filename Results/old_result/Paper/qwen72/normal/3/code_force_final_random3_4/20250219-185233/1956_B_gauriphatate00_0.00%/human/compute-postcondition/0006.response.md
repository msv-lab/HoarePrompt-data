The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value 1. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `results` is an empty list.**
