Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of the list `a`, `len_b` is the length of the list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 0, and the length of `a` is greater than 1. If `a[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 0. Otherwise, `count_a` and `count_b` remain 0.***
