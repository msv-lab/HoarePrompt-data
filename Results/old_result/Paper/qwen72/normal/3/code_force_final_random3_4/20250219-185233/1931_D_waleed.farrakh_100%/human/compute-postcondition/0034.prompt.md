Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is an empty list, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, and `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1, and `count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is an empty list, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1, and `count` remains unchanged. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 and `count` remains unchanged. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1 and `count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
