Output State: **The program returns a string that is the result of joining all characters in the `decoded` list, where each character in `decoded` is the corresponding key from `mapping` for the character in `encoded`. If `encoded` has more than 26 unique characters, the last 26 characters of `encoded` will be mapped to the 26 lowercase Latin letters in `mapping`, and the `decoded` list will contain the corresponding keys for all characters in `encoded`.**
