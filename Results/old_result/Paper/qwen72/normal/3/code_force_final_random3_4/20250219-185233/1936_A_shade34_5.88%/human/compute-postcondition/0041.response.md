Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `_` has completed its iterations, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is `=`, otherwise `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is not `=`, and `s` is the new user input string.***
