Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 499.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.
   - Additionally, `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`, and will end with a space instead of a newline.
   - From the initial state, we know that `j` is 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The integer `1` is explicitly given.
   - The value of `j` is 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **1 1**
