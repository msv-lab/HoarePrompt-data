Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **If \( x < k - 1 \)**: The program checks if \( a \geq x + 1 \). This is incorrect because \( x \) is the maximum number of consecutive losses, and \( k \) is the multiplier for wins. The correct condition should be \( a \geq 1 \) because Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin and win, or lose and still have enough coins to continue betting.
   - **If \( x == k - 1 \)**: The program checks if \( a \geq x + 3 \). This is also incorrect. The correct condition should be \( a \geq 1 \) for the same reason as above.
   - **If \( x > k - 1 \)**: The program uses a loop to calculate \( z \) and then checks if \( a \geq z \). This loop is not correctly implemented and does not reflect the correct strategy for ensuring Sasha can achieve any number of coins.

2. **Correct Strategy**:
   - Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin. If he wins, his coins increase by \( k - 1 \). If he loses, he loses 1 coin.
   - The key is to ensure that Sasha can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses. After \( x \) losses, he should still have enough coins to place a bet that can potentially win back his losses and more.
   - The correct condition to check is whether Sasha can guarantee that he will always have at least 1 coin after \( x \) consecutive losses. This can be calculated as:
     \[
     a \geq \sum_{i=0}^{x} \left\lceil \frac{1}{k-1} \right\rceil
     \]
     Simplifying, this is:
     \[
     a \geq \left\lceil \frac{x + 1}{k - 1} \right\rceil
     \]

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should check if \( a \geq \left\lceil \frac{x + 1}{k - 1} \right\rceil \).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= (x + 1) // (k - 1) + (1 if (x + 1) % (k - 1) != 0 else 0):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Sasha can always place bets such that he is guaranteed to win any number of coins, given the constraints of the problem.
