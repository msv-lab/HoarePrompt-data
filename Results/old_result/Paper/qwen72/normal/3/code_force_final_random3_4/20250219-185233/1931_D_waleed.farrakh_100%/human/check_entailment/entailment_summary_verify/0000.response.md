### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines. This approach is efficient for large inputs as it avoids multiple calls to `input()`.
   - It then processes the first line to determine the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It constructs a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x` to ensure it is non-negative.
     - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count` because it means there are elements in the array that can form a beautiful pair with the current element.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the results list.

3. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - The conditions for a beautiful pair are:
     - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that these conditions are met:
     - `rx` is calculated to ensure that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. Specifically, `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if `a_i % x + a_j % x` is divisible by `x`.
     - `ry` is calculated to ensure that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. Specifically, `a % y` ensures that `a_i % y - a_j % y` is divisible by `y`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints on the input size and the values of `x` and `y` correctly.
   - It correctly processes each test case independently and accumulates the results.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case and handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
