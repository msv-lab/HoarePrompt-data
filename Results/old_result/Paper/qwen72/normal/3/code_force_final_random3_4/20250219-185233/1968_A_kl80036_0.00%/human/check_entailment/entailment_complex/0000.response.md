Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding an integer \( y \) (1 â‰¤ \( y \) < \( x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The approach taken by the program is to set \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) (i.e., the integer division of \( x \) by 2).

To determine if this approach is correct, let's analyze the problem:

1. **GCD and Divisors**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest positive integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder. For \( y \) to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), \( y \) should be as large as possible while still having a significant GCD with \( x \).

2. **Choosing \( y = x // 2 \)**: 
   - If \( x \) is even, \( x // 2 \) is exactly half of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, x // 2) = x // 2 \). Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x // 2) + x // 2 = x \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is close to half of \( x \). The GCD of \( x \) and \( x // 2 \) will be 1 (since \( x \) is odd and \( x // 2 \) is even), and thus \( \gcd(x, x // 2) + x // 2 = 1 + x // 2 \). This is not the maximum possible value, but it is a valid \( y \) that satisfies the condition \( 1 \le y < x \).

3. **Optimality**:
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is indeed the optimal choice because it maximizes the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is a valid choice, but it may not always be the optimal one. However, the problem statement allows for any \( y \) that satisfies the condition, so this is still a valid solution.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases \( t \) and then processing each test case by reading \( x \) and printing \( y \).
   - The program does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem statement that only requires printing the result.

Given the above analysis, the program is correct in terms of handling the input and output format and providing a valid \( y \) for each \( x \). However, it may not always provide the optimal \( y \) for odd \( x \), but this is acceptable according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
