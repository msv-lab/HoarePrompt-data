Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element (`nums[0]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[i]` is updated to \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\).
- `k.bit_length()` gives the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.
- \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1)\) shifts 1 left by \((k.bit_length() - 1)\) positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\).
- Subtracting 1 from this value gives \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\).
- Since `i` is 0, the first element of the list `nums` is set to this value.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`) remain unchanged.
