Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains `False`.**
