- `n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1.
- `k` remains 1.
- `c` is incremented by 1.
- `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- `r` is decremented by 1.
- `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`.

The specific values of `ans`, `arr[r]`, `m`, and `MOD` are not provided, but the changes to the variables are described based on the given code snippet.
