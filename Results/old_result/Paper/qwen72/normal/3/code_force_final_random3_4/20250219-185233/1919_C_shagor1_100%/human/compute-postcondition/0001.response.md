Functionality: **The function `func_1` is intended to accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is the number of test cases, an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is the size of the array for each test case, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, with each element `a_i` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2·10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
