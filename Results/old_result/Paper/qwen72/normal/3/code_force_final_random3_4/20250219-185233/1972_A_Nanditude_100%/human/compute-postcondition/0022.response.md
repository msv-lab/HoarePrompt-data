Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
3. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
4. `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where \(1 \leq b_1 \leq b_2 \leq \ldots \leq b_n \leq 10^9\).
5. `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b`.
6. `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b` or the length of `a` if all elements in `a` are less than the elements in `b`.
7. `j` is \(n-1\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b`.
   - This means we need to find the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b` and count how many elements in `b` are less than this element.

2. **Understanding `i`**:
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b`.
   - If no such element exists in `a` (i.e., all elements in `a` are less than the elements in `b`), then `i` is the length of `a`.

3. **Calculating `cnt`**:
   - If `i` is the length of `a`, it means all elements in `a` are less than the elements in `b`. In this case, `cnt` will be 0 because there are no elements in `b` that are less than any element in `a`.
   - If `i` is a valid index in `a`, then `cnt` will be the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**:
  - `a = [10, 20, 30]`
  - `b = [5, 15, 25, 35]`
  - The first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b` is `20` (at index 1).
  - Elements in `b` less than `20` are `[5, 15]`.
  - Therefore, `cnt = 2`.

- **Scenario 2**:
  - `a = [5, 10, 15]`
  - `b = [20, 30, 40]`
  - All elements in `a` are less than the elements in `b`.
  - Therefore, `i = 3` (length of `a`), and `cnt = 0`.

### Final Output:
The `print(cnt)` statement will print the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b`. If all elements in `a` are less than the elements in `b`, `cnt` will be 0.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b`, or 0 if all elements in `a` are less than the elements in `b`)**
