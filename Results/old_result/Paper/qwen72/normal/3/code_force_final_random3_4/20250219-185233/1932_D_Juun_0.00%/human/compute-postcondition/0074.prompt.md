You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character trump_suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings cards, where each string is a two-character card description (first character is the rank '2'-'9', second character is the suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and all cards are unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards whose suits match `trump`. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for all suits that have been processed in the loop.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is an empty list or contains the remaining elements that were not used. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit. If `trumps` became empty before all non-`None` values in `suits` were processed, the program returned 'IMPOSSIBLE' and did not complete all iterations.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), and all elements in `answers` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list `cards` of 2n unique strings, where each string is a two-character card description (first character is the rank '2'-'9', second character is the suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). The function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns without any value, as the return statement is not followed by any expression or variable.

Case_3: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
