The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `x` from the input, and for each value of `x`, it reads `x` pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (each pair on a new line). For each pair, it prints the two integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values have been processed and printed, but no changes are made to any external variables or state.
