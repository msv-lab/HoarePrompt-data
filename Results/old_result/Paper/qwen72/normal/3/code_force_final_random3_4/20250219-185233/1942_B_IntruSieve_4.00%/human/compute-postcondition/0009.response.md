Postcondition: **`minn` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the value 0, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is greater than 0. Additionally, `minn` is equal to `maxx` (both are 1 and 0, respectively, which means this condition is false, but the postcondition must reflect the state as if the if condition were true).**
