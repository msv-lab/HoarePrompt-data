### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes the array `ans` with `10^9` for all `n` elements. This ensures that `a_i` is within the required range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

2. **Updating `ans`**:
   - The function then iterates backward through the array `arr` starting from the second last element (index `n-2`).
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it updates `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This is intended to ensure that `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i`.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) should yield `arr[i]`. However, the way `ans[i]` is updated (`ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`) does not guarantee that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i]` will equal `arr[i]`.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the first test case with `arr = [2, 4, 1]` and `n = 4`.
   - The function initializes `ans` as `[1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`.
   - The loop updates `ans` as follows:
     - `ans[2] = ans[3] - arr[2] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`
     - `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995`
     - `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993`
   - The resulting `ans` is `[999999993, 999999995, 999999999, 1000000000]`.
   - However, this does not satisfy the conditions:
     - `999999995 % 999999993` is not `2`.
     - `999999999 % 999999995` is not `4`.
     - `1000000000 % 999999999` is not `1`.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To ensure `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i`, we need to set `a_i` such that `a_{i-1}` is a multiple of `x_i` plus `x_i` itself. For example, if `x_i = 2`, then `a_i` should be `a_{i-1} + 2` or a multiple of `a_{i-1}` plus `2`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly compute the array `a` such that `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 \le i \le n`. The update logic in the function `func_1` does not ensure the correct modulo relationship.
