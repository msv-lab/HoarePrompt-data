### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be satisfied.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` is a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known and correct method for finding the GCD.
   - This function is correct and will be used to find \(\gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The function initializes `cnt` to \(-1\), which is unusual and might be a mistake.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` and checking if `x % y == 0`.
   - Finally, it returns `cnt`.

4. **Analyzing the Logic:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \quad \text{for some integer } k
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
   - This means \(a\) must be of the form \(b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).

5. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to find pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition.
   - The calculation of `x` and `y` and the update of `cnt` do not align with the required condition.
   - Specifically, `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not seem to be related to the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
   - The initialization of `cnt` to \(-1\) and the subsequent operations are not clear and do not seem to count the valid pairs correctly.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not match the required condition for the pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. The logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not align with the problem requirements.
