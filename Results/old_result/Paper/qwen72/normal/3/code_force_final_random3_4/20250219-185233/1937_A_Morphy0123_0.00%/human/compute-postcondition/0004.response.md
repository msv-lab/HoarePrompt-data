The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the values of `i`, `n_cases`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the literal value `1` being printed.

Output: **1**
