Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is `>`, `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
