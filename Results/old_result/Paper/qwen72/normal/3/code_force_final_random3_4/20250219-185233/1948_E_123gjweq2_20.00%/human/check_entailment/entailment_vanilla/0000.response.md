### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We need to add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` is the main function that handles the input and output.
   - `make_array` is a helper function that assigns values to the vertices and determines their clique membership.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned values and clique memberships, respectively.
   - It iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the arrays.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - It takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It calculates the number of elements to be assigned in the current clique.
   - It assigns the smallest elements to the first half of the range and the largest elements to the second half.
   - It updates both `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.

5. **Edge Condition Analysis:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is crucial.
   - The program attempts to partition the vertices into cliques by assigning values in a way that ensures the edge condition is met.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique memberships for each vertex.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( k \ge n \), the graph should be a single clique, and the program should handle this correctly.
   - For smaller values of \( k \), the program should partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

8. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)**
       - `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`
       - `arr = [2, 1]`
       - `cliquess = [1, 1]`
       - This is correct because \( |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 2 \le 3 \).
     - **Example 2: \( n = 5, k = 4 \)**
       - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
       - `arr = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`
       - `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
       - This is correct because the edge condition is met for the given partition.
     - **Example 3: \( n = 8, k = 16 \)**
       - `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`
       - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
       - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
       - This is correct because \( k \ge n \) and the graph is a single clique.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the given problem and examples. It assigns values to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques as required.

Correctness: **True**
