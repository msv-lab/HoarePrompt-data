The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200 characters, the function prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 characters or more, the function prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each case.
