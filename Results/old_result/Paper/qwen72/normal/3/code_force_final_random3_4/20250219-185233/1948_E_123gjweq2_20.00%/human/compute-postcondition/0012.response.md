Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 2, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`, `i` is 2, `arr[left]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left]` is `clique`, `arr[left + 1]` is `left + 2`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + 2]` is `left + 3`, `cliquess[left + 2]` is `clique`.**
