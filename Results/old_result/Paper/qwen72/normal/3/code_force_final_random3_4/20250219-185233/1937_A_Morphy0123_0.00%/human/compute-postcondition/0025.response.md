To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition: `power < log2(n)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n_cases` is greater than 1 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `power` is 1.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `power < log2(n)`.
   - `power` is currently 1.
   - `log2(n)` is the base-2 logarithm of `n`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1.
   - The base-2 logarithm of `n` is greater than 1 if `n` is greater than 2 (since `log2(2) = 1` and `log2(3) â‰ˆ 1.585`).

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop executes the first time, `n` must be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
