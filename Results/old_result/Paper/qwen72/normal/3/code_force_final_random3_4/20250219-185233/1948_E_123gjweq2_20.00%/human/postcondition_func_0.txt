The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, with the constraints 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k` and assigns each element in two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, a clique number (from 1 to the number of cliques). The function then prints the elements of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the elements of `cliquess`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of length `n` where each element is set to its respective clique number, and the number of cliques is printed.
