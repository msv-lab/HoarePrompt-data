### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `tt` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers `a`.
   - The list `a` is sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between chosen vertices.

2. **Initial Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is because each chosen vertex can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and `y` additional vertices can be chosen to maximize the number of triangles.
   - The `-2` term accounts for the fact that the first and last vertices in the sorted list `a` are already counted.

3. **Processing Gaps Between Chosen Vertices**:
   - The function iterates over the sorted list `a` to calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it means a triangle can be formed immediately, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is even but not 2, the gap is divided by 2 and added to the list `tmp`.

4. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertices**:
   - The function checks the gap between the last and first vertices in the sorted list `a` (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - If the gap is exactly 2, `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is even but not 2, the gap is divided by 2 and added to the list `tmp`.

5. **Sorting and Processing `tmp`**:
   - The list `tmp` is sorted to process the gaps in ascending order.
   - For each gap in `tmp`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, the function adds `i` to `ans` and decrements `y` by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the loop breaks as no more gaps can be processed.

6. **Final Adjustment and Output**:
   - The function adds the remaining value of `y` to `ans`.
   - The final result is the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` (since the maximum number of triangles in an n-sided polygon is `n - 2`).
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. It ensures that the number of triangles is maximized by considering the gaps between chosen vertices and using the additional vertices `y` to fill these gaps. The final adjustment to ensure the result does not exceed `n - 2` is also correct.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: True**
