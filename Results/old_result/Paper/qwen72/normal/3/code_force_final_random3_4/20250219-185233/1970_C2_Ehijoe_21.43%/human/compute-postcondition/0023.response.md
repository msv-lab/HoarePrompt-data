Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers that are connected to the key, `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing the integer `n - 1` if the length of the list associated with `key` (which is `n - 1`) in `nodes` is 1, otherwise `leaves` contains the integer `key`.**
