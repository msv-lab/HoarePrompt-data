### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not take any parameters, which means it relies on global input within the function. This is a design flaw, but it does not affect the correctness of the program given the constraints and the way the input is handled.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the highest non-trump card for each suit.
   - It also uses a list `trumps` to store all the trump cards.
   - The list `answers` is used to store the pairs of cards that can be played in each round.

3. **Processing Cards**:
   - The program iterates through each card in the input.
   - If the card is a trump card, it adds the rank to the `trumps` list.
   - If the card is a non-trump card and there is already a card of the same suit in `suits`, it sorts the two cards and adds the pair to the `answers` list, then removes the suit from `suits`.
   - If the card is a non-trump card and there is no card of the same suit in `suits`, it adds the card to `suits`.

4. **Handling Remaining Cards**:
   - After processing all cards, the program checks if there are any remaining non-trump cards in `suits`.
   - If there are remaining non-trump cards and no trump cards left, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.
   - If there are remaining non-trump cards and trump cards are available, it pairs the remaining non-trump card with a trump card and adds the pair to the `answers` list.

5. **Printing Trump Pairs**:
   - The program sorts the remaining trump cards in descending order.
   - It then prints pairs of trump cards, ensuring that the higher-ranked card beats the lower-ranked card.

6. **Printing Answers**:
   - Finally, the program prints all pairs in the `answers` list.

### Potential Issues:
- **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` should ideally take parameters for `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` to make the function more modular and testable. However, the current implementation works as intended given the constraints.
- **Card Pairing**:
  - The program correctly pairs non-trump cards of the same suit and ensures the higher-ranked card beats the lower-ranked card.
  - The program also correctly pairs remaining non-trump cards with trump cards, ensuring the trump card beats the non-trump card.
  - The program handles the case where there are no remaining trump cards to pair with non-trump cards by printing "IMPOSSIBLE".
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where there are no non-trump cards left to pair with trump cards by printing the remaining trump pairs.
  - The program also handles the case where there are no valid pairs to be made, printing "IMPOSSIBLE" as required.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and edge cases. It ensures that each round is valid according to the rules of the game and prints the results in the required format. The only minor issue is the lack of parameterization in `func_1`, but this does not affect the correctness of the program given the constraints and input handling.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
