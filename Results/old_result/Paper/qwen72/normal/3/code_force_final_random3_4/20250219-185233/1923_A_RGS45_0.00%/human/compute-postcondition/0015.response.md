The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, and `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, and `_` will be assigned a new value by the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive)**
