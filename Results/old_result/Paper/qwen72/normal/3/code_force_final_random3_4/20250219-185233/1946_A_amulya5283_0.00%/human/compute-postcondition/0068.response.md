Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the number of operations required for each of the t test cases to ensure all elements in the heap are greater than the current median, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first element of the last tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the last tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are strictly greater than `current_median`, and `operations` is the number of times the loop executed for the last test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same, indicating the total number of test cases.
- The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged, still containing all the test cases.
- The variable `results` now contains a list of integers, each representing the number of operations required for the corresponding test case to ensure all elements in the heap are greater than the current median.
- The variable `i` is equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has processed the last test case.
- The variable `n` is the length of the array in the last test case.
- The variable `arr` is the sorted version of the array in the last test case.
- The variable `median_index` is the index of the median element in the sorted array of the last test case.
- The variable `current_median` is the median value of the sorted array in the last test case.
- The variable `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from the sorted array starting from the median index to the end, with all elements strictly greater than the current median.
- The variable `operations` contains the number of operations performed for the last test case.
