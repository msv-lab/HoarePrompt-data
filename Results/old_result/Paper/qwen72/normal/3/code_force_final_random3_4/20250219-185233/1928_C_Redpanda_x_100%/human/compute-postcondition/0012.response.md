Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.** 

The value of `prime_to_i` has been updated to `prime * prime`, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
