The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is controlled by the range defined by the integer input. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `_` is 1, and the loop can execute again if the range defined by the input is greater than 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented to 2, and the input must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, and `_` is 2. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input. If `n` is odd, the condition 2 * a < b holds if 2 * a < b; otherwise, the condition 2 * a >= b holds. If `n` is even, the condition 2 * a < b holds if 2 * a < b; otherwise, the condition 2 * a >= b holds. The input must be greater than 1.**
