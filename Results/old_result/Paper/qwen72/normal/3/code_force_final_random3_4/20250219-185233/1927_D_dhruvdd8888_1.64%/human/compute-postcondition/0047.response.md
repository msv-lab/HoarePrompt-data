Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0.
2. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user.
3. If `tc` is greater than 5, the loop continues to the next iteration.
4. If `ppp` is equal to 23, the postcondition remains unchanged.
5. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
6. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. Additionally, `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and the current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The `print` statement will always print `-1, -1` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, `tc`, `ppp`, `eli`, or `LA`.

### Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
