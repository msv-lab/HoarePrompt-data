Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is 0, `item` is 0, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`, `res` is the input string, and the current value of `res` is '>'**

Explanation: The code snippet `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` (which is 0) to `mini`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mini` is now 0, while all other initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
