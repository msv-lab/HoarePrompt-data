Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers provided by the user. If the new `a` < new `b` < new `c`, the condition is true. Otherwise, the condition (new `a` < new `b` < new `c`) is false, and if (new `a` < new `b` > new `c`) is true, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition. If neither (new `a` < new `b` < new `c`) nor (new `a` < new `b` > new `c`) is true, both conditions are false.**
