Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. p is a permutation of length n, and a is an array of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'. MOD is 1000000007. `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`pres` is updated to `pres + sum(paths[:min(k, len(paths))])`, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`, `i` is `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[min(k, len(paths)) - 1] * (k - (min(k, len(paths)) - 1))`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`, `paths` must have at least `min(k, len(paths))` elements, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, `resb` is greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `ress` is greater than or equal to `resb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, and `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, `resb` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`, ensuring that `resb` is always greater than or equal to `ress`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, `resb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= i + 1`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `i` is `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`, `paths` must have at least `min(k, len(paths))` elements, `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(k, len(paths)) - 1] * (k - (min(k, len(paths)) - 1))`. If `k` is less than `len(paths)`, the loop breaks after `k` iterations. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, `resb` remains greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `ress` is greater than or equal to `resb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
