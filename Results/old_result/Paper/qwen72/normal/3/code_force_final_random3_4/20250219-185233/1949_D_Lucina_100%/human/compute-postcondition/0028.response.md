Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 3 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 3. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[2]` are each incremented by 1, and `a[2]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b[1]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged, and `a[2]` remains unchanged.***
