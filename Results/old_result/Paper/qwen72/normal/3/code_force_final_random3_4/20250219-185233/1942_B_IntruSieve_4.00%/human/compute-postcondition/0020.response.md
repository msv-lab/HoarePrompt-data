Output State: **`minn` is 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and `minn` (which is now 1 or 2), `maxx` is 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 1.**

The value of `minn` is incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged, but the value of `minn` in the `mex` list is updated to reflect the new value of `minn`.
