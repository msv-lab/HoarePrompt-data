Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between the second element (`new_arr[1]`) and the first element (`new_arr[0]`) of the `new_arr` list. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `left`, `right`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged.
