Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an input integer greater than 0, a, b, and c are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, i is n-1, possible is True if any of the following conditions are met during the loop execution: (1) a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or (2) a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]. Otherwise, possible remains False.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an input integer greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are still input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed. The value of `i` is `n-1` because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`. The value of `possible` will be `True` if, during any iteration of the loop, either `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` was not equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` was not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` was not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If none of these conditions were met during the loop execution, `possible` remains `False`.
