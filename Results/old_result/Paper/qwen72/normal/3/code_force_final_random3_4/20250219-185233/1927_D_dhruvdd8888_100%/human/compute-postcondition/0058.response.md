Postcondition: **`_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1), `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the program maintains the values of `s`, `e`, and `_` as described in the precondition. If `e` is less than `r`, the program also maintains the values of `s`, `e`, and `_` as described in the precondition.**
