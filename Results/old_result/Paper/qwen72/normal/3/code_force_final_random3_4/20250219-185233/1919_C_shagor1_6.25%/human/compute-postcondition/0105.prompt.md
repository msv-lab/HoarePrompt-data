Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem but the function definition is incomplete. The input parameters should include a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list, and the function should handle multiple test cases, so an additional integer `t` representing the number of test cases should also be included. Each element in `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the size of `a` is 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` if it exists and is different from `x`, otherwise `y` is the smallest element in `inp`. `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`, and `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists and is different from `x`), and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
