Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime_to_i * prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `factor` is the next element from `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be a non-negative integer, values `factor * prime_to_i * prime ** i` for i in range(factors[prime] + 1) have been yielded.**

### Explanation:
- **`k`**: This variable remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`rest`**: This variable also remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`prime`**: This variable remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`prime_to_i`**: After all iterations of the loop, `prime_to_i` will have been multiplied by `prime` a total of `factors[prime] + 1` times. Therefore, `prime_to_i` will be equal to its initial value multiplied by `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`.
- **`factor`**: This variable remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`factors[prime]`**: This variable remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **Values Yielded**: The loop yields the value `factor * prime_to_i * prime ** i` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `factors[prime]` (inclusive). This means that the loop will yield `factors[prime] + 1` values, each time multiplying the initial `prime_to_i` by an additional power of `prime`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables and the values that have been yielded after the loop has completed all its iterations.
