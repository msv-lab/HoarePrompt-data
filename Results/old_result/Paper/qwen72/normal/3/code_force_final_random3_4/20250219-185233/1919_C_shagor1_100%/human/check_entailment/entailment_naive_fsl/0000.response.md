Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. According to the problem description, the penalty for such an array should be `n-1` because any split will result in at least one subsequence being sorted, and the penalty will be the number of increasing pairs in that subsequence. However, the program does not account for this and may return a lower penalty than expected.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `3` (since the array is already sorted, and any split will result in at least one subsequence being sorted, leading to a penalty of `3`), but the program will output `0` because it does not correctly handle the case where the array is already sorted.

This indicates that the program is not handling all potential cases correctly, and thus the correctness is **False**.
