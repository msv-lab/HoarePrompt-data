Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`.**

The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
