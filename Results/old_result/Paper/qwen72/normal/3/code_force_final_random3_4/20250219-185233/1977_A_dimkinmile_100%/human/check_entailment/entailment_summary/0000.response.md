Reasoning:  
The program's logic is based on the condition that the difference `(n - m)` must be even and non-negative for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This condition is correct because:

1. **Even Difference**: For Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of times he puts a cube on the tower must be equal to the number of times he removes a cube plus `m`. This means that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes in the tower `(n - m)` must be even. This is because each pair of moves (one put and one remove) cancels out, and the remaining moves must be all puts or all removes, which must be even to balance out to `m`.

2. **Non-negative Difference**: The difference `(n - m)` must be non-negative because Nikita cannot remove more cubes than he has put on the tower. If `n < m`, it is impossible for him to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there is a minor issue in the program: the function `func_1` is called before it is defined. This will cause a `NameError` in Python. To fix this, the function should be defined before it is called.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()
```

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the logic of the program is correct, but the order of function definition and call needs to be fixed.

Correctness: **False** (due to the function definition order issue)
