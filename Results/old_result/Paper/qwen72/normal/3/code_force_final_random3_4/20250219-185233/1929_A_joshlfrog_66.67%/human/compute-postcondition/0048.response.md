Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `e` is 1 (though `e` is not used in the code snippet).
- `l` is a new input integer (though `l` and `i` are not used in the code snippet).
- `i` is `l - 1` (though `i` is not used in the code snippet).
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

The code snippet:
```
print(x - y)
```

This code prints the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the list `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
