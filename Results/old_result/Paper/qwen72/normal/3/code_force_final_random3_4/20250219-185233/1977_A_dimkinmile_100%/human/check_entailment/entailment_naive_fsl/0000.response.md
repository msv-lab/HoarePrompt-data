Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the logic for determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is incorrect. The correct condition should be that `n` and `m` must have the same parity (both even or both odd) for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes in the tower changes with each move.

A case where the program fails:
- Input: `n = 3`, `m = 2`
- Expected Output: `No`
- Actual Output: `Yes`

In this case, `n - m = 1` which is odd, but the program incorrectly returns `Yes` because it checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. The correct condition should be `n % 2 == m % 2`.
