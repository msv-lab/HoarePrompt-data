Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a sequence of four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200) from the input. It then calculates a value based on a formula that depends on whether each `p_i` is even or odd, and whether the index `i` is less than 3. The result of this formula for each test case is printed on a new line. The function does not return any value. **
