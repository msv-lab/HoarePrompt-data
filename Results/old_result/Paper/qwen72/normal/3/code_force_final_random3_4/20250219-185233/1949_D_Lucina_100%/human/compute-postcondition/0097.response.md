Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings. If `b[1]` is greater than 0 and `a[1]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the integer 1 and `sa` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain as they were initially.***
