Output State: **The function `func_1` should actually be defined with parameters `n` and `m`, and the input should be structured such that the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, and each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). `n` and `m` are now assigned the values of the two integers read from the input.**
