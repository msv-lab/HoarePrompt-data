Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- The input value `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.
- The current value of `minn` is `inf` (which stands for infinity).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, and `minn` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
- The initial state provides context for the variables, but the `print` statement is independent of these variables and will always print `-1`.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
