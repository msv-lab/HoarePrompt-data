Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros with the element at index -1 incremented by 1 and the element at index `x` incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least three integers, `r` is 'z' followed by the character at index `x` in `a` and then the character at index `x` in `a` again, `i` is the third integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.** 

In natural language: The string `r` is updated to include the character at index `x` in `a` one more time. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `b` still has the element at index -1 incremented by 1 and the element at index `x` incremented by 1. The string `a` remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The integer `t` is still 1. The integer `n` is still an input integer greater than 1. The list `s` is still a list of integers input by the user that must have at least three integers. The integer `i` is still the third integer in the list `s`. The integer `x` is still the index of `i` in the list `b`.
