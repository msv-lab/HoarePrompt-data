### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not handle the MEX operation as required by the problem. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning step by step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.
   - However, it does not compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it uses a recursive approach to maximize the sum by considering different segments of the array and adding the values of the elements.
   - This approach is fundamentally different from the problem's requirement, which involves computing the MEX and then setting the elements of the subarray to this MEX value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
   - It relies on the results of `func_1` to determine the operations, but since `func_1` does not correctly compute the MEX, `func_2` will also produce incorrect operations.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is designed to transform a subarray into a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`.
   - It checks if the subarray already forms a sequence from 0 to `i` and, if not, sets all elements to `i`.
   - This is not the correct way to handle the MEX operation. The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, not necessarily `i`.

### Example Analysis:

Consider the input:
```
4
0 2 1 3
```

- **Correct Output**:
  - The MEX of the entire array [0, 2, 1, 3] is 4.
  - Setting all elements to 4 results in the array [4, 4, 4, 4], with a sum of 16.
  - The correct output should be:
    ```
    16 1
    1 4
    ```

- **Program Output**:
  - The program does not correctly compute the MEX and will likely produce an incorrect result. For instance, it might set elements to a value that is not the MEX, leading to a suboptimal sum.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the MEX operation and the subsequent transformation of the subarray. Therefore, it will not produce the correct maximum sum or the correct sequence of operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
