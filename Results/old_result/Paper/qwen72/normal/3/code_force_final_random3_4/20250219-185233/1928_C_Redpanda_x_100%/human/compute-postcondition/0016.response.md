Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded for each iteration from 0 to `factors[prime]`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `prime_to_i` will be equal to the prime number `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`. The loop will have yielded the value `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration, where `prime_to_i` starts at 1 and is multiplied by `prime` in each iteration, resulting in `prime_to_i` being `prime` raised to the power of the current iteration index. The loop will have run `factors[prime] + 1` times, and the other variables (`k`, `rest`, `prime`) will remain unchanged from their initial state.
