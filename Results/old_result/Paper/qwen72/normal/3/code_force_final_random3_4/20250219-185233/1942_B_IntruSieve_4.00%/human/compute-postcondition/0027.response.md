To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions within the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `minn` is 0, 1, or 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user
- `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and possibly `minn` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`
- `maxx` is 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`
- `i` is 1

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
- `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i` (which is 2) for the loop to execute again.

### Updated State:
- `minn` remains 0, 1, or 2 (unchanged, as it is not in the loop head)
- `n` is greater than 2 (to ensure the loop can execute again)
- `arr` remains a list of integers input by the user (unchanged, as it is not in the loop head)
- `mex` remains a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and possibly `minn` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)` (unchanged, as it is not in the loop head)
- `maxx` remains 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr` (unchanged, as it is not in the loop head)
- `i` is 2

### Final State:
State: **`minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and possibly `minn` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 2**
