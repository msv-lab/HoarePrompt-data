To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and `j` must start at `n - 1` and be greater than or equal to `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples
- `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
- `cards` is a list of integers input by the user
- `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop
- `i` is `n - 5`
- `j` is `-1`

We need to adjust `j` to ensure it starts at `n - 1` and `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1), `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 1`**
