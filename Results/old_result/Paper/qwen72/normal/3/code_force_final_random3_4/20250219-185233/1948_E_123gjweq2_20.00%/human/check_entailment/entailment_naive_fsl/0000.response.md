Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the construction of the graph and the partitioning into cliques for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in `make_array` and `func_1` does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem description. 

One potential issue is in the `make_array` function, where the elements are assigned in a way that might not satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for all pairs of vertices \( (i, j) \). For example, consider the input \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \):

- The program will create two cliques: one with vertices 1, 2, 3 and another with vertices 4, 5.
- The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays will be:
  - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`

However, this does not form the correct cliques. For instance, vertices 1 and 3 should not be in the same clique because \( |1 - 3| + |1 - 3| = 4 \), which is equal to \( k \), but the program incorrectly places them in the same clique.

Another issue is that the program does not handle the case where \( k \) is very large (e.g., \( k \ge n \)), which should result in all vertices forming a single clique. The current logic does not account for this scenario.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
