To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is at least 0, and `i` starts at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is assigned the value of the integer converted from the input string.
- `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
- `s` is 0.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the first integer in the `nums` list.
- `arr` is an empty list.

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(N + 1):
```

For the loop to execute:
- `N` must be at least 0.
- `i` should start at 0.

Since `N` is derived from the input string, we need to ensure that `N` is a non-negative integer. The loop will execute `N + 1` times, starting from `i = 0`.

State: **`N` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 0**
