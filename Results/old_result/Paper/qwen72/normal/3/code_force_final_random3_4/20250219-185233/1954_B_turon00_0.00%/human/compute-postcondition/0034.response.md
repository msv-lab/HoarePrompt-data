Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**

The code snippet `tmp = a[0]` assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. Since `tmp` was already assigned the first element of `a` in the initial state, this code does not change the value of `tmp`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
