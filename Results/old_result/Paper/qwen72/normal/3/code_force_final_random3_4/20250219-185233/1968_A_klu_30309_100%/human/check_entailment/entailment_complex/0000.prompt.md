Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

# Annotated Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have `t` elements, `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that `gcd_val + y` is maximized, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y` and `y` itself is maximized, for each `x` in the list `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`, where `1 <= t <= 1000` and each integer `x` in `test_cases` satisfies `2 <= x <= 1000`. It returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and `y` itself is maximized, for each `x` in `test_cases`. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` or `test_cases`.
