Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their paths through a permutation `p` and an array `a`. The function prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's maximum score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's maximum score is higher, and 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. **
