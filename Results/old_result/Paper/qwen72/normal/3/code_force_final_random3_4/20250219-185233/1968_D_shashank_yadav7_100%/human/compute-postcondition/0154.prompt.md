Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. p is a permutation of length n, containing integers from 1 to n. a is an array of length n, containing integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1` (or `n` if the loop breaks early), `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - n` (or `k - i` if the loop breaks early), `b` is the result of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`), `s` is the result of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`), `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[s] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[b] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are set to -1, and the loop breaks. Additionally, if `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n-1` or the loop breaks when `k` reaches 0, `k` is `k - n` or `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times or until `k` reaches 0), `s` is `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times or until `k` reaches 0), `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each `b` and `k` during the loop, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each `s` and `k` during the loop, `sp` is increased by the sum of `a[s]` for each `s` during the loop, `bp` is increased by the sum of `a[b]` for each `b` during the loop, and `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the initial value of `n`, `t` is greater than `n`, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus `n`, `b` is the value of `p[b]` after `n` iterations minus `n`, `s` is the value of `p[s]` after `n` iterations minus `n`, `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `n` times `a[s]`, `bp` is the sum of `n` times `a[b]`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `k` reaches 0 before `n` iterations, the loop breaks early. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` remains greater than or equal to `sm`. Otherwise, if `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
