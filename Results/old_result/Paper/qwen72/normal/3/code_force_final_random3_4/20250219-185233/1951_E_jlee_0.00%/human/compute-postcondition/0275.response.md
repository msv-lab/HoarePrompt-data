Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `string` is a new input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
   - `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 3.
   - `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2 and `done` is True.
   - Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `count` remain unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and variable values, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, or `done`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
