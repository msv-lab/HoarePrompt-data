Output State: **`vis` is a list where the element at index `ps - 1` is now 1, and all other elements remain 0. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `pb - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again, `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `ps - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again, `ps` is now the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `vis` list has the element at index `ps - 1` set to 1, indicating that this index has been visited.
- The `p` list remains unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, and `ress` remain unchanged.
- The `a` list remains unchanged.
- The `pathb` list contains the elements of `a` that form the cycle starting from `pb - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered.
- The `paths` list contains the elements of `a` that form the cycle starting from `ps - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered.
- The `ps` variable is now the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index, which caused the loop to break.
