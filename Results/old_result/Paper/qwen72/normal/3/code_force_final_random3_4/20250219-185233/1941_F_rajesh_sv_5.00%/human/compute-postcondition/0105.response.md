Output State: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively.**
