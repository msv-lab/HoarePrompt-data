Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In this scenario, the provided code snippet does not return any value explicitly, so the program ends without returning anything. The initial state describes variables `n`, `i`, `v`, `t`, and `test_cases`, but the code snippet itself does not modify or return any of these variables.
