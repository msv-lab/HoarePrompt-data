Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.
   - `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order.
   - `mini` is 0.
   - `item` is the first element in `arr[1:]`, which is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `mini` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `item` is the first element in `arr[1:]`, which is the list `arr` starting from the second element. Since `arr` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, the first element in `arr[1:]` is 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, then the value of `item` twice.
   - Therefore, the output will be: `? 0 0 1 1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
