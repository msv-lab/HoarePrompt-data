Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` and `r` are updated to new input integers.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `tc > 5`.
   - `ppp` is either 23 or not 23.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print(-1, -1)` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - It simply prints the integers `-1` and `-1`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the print statement is independent of the initial state and always prints the same values, the output will be:
     Output: **-1, -1**.
