Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) for a beautiful array of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer.**
