Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and the range is 2. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list with two elements [1, 26]. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing [26, 26].** 

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `range`) remain unchanged. The condition for `arr` is still valid based on the updated value of `lex`.
