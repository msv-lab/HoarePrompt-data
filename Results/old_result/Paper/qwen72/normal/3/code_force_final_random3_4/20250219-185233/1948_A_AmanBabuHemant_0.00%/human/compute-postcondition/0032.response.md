Output State: **`_` is `t-1`, `t` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `_`, or `n`, and `s` is not defined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The loop counter `_` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The value of `t` will be 0, as the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `n` will still be an input integer, and its value will be the last input provided for the last iteration of the loop.
- If `n` is odd, the function will have printed 'NO' for that iteration, and `s` will not be defined for that iteration.
- If `n` is even, the function will have printed 'YES' followed by the string `s`, which consists of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` will be less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` will be 200 or more if `n // 2` is 67 or more. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, the function will have printed 'NO' for that iteration.
