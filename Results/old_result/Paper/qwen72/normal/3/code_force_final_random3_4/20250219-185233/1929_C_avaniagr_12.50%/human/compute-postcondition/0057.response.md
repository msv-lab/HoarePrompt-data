The provided `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The variable `_` is mentioned as being incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute, but this information is not relevant to the `print` statement itself.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
