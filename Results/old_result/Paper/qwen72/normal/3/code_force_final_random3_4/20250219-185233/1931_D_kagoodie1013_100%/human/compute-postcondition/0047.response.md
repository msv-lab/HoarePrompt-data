The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `arr`, which are elements of the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` that is being iterated over from the list `test_cases`. The state of `test_cases` itself and the position within the list are also relevant for the loop to continue.

At the end of the last iteration, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` was the second tuple in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` must now be the third tuple in `test_cases`. The `test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples for the loop to execute again.

The other variables mentioned in the state, such as `count`, `residue_map`, and `results`, are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged and must have at least 3 tuples, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements.**
