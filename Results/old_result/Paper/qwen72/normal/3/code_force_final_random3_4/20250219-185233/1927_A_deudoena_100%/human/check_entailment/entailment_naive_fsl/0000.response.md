Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum length of the segment to be painted white is flawed. The program only considers the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string, but it does not account for scenarios where the black cells are not at the edges of the strip.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
WBBBW
```
The expected output should be `3` because the minimum segment that needs to be painted is from the 2nd to the 4th cell. However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly calculates the segment length based on the first and last 'B' characters.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
