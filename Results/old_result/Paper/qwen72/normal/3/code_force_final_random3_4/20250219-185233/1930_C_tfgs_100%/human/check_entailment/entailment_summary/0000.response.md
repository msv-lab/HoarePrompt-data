Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by first modifying the array `a` such that each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, then it constructs the set `S` from these modified values, and finally, it generates the array `b` by sorting the elements of `S` in descending order and filling any gaps with additional numbers to ensure the array `b` has exactly `n` elements.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Modification of `a`**: The program correctly modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it, which aligns with the problem statement.
2. **Handling Duplicates**: The program uses a `Counter` to track the counts of elements in the modified `a`. This is intended to handle duplicates, but the logic for filling gaps is flawed.
3. **Gap Filling**: The program attempts to fill gaps between elements in the sorted set `S` to ensure the final array `b` has `n` elements. However, the logic for filling these gaps is incorrect and does not always produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Let's break down the issues:

- **Gap Filling Logic**: The program tries to fill gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted set `S` by adding numbers that are not present in `S`. However, the logic for determining how many numbers to add (`adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`) is not correct. It does not always ensure that the gaps are filled in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the resulting array `b`.

- **Handling Duplicates**: The program correctly removes duplicates by converting `a` to a set, but the way it handles the count of duplicates (`cur += counter[a[i]]`) and the gap filling (`ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)`) is not optimal. It does not always add the largest possible numbers to fill the gaps.

- **Final Gap Filling**: The program appends the remaining numbers to `ans` in a decrementing manner (`ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)`), which is not always the best way to ensure the lexicographically largest array.

Given these issues, the program does not always produce the correct lexicographically largest array `b`.

Correctness: **False**
