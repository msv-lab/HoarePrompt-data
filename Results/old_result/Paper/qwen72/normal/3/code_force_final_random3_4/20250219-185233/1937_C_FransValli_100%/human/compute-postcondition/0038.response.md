To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `maxi` is 0.
- The state of `arr` and `res` is dependent on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2].
  - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [0, 1, 2] and `maxi` is 0.
  - If `res` is not '<' or '=', then `arr` is [0, 1] if `res` is not '=', otherwise `arr` remains [0] and `maxi` remains 0.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 3.
4. **Condition Check**: The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 3) is less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The states of `arr`, `res`, and `maxi` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2]. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [0, 1, 2] and `maxi` is 0. If `res` is not '<' or '=', then `arr` is [0, 1] if `res` is not '=', otherwise `arr` remains [0] and `maxi` remains 0. `n` must be greater than 3.**
