Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`.
   - `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x`.
   - `done` is False.
   - If `n` == 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will always print `1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is `1`.

Output: **1**
