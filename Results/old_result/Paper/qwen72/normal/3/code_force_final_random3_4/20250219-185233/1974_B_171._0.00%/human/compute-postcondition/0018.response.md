Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `c` is 99, `decoded` is an empty list. If `chr(99)` ('c') is not present in the values of `mapping` and `chr(98)` ('b') is not present in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'c' mapped to `char`. Otherwise, `mapping` remains an empty dictionary.***
