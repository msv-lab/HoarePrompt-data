Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list that has been appended with either the string '1' or '0'. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 (i.e., `x & 2`) results in a non-zero value, `s` contains the string '1' followed by '0'. Otherwise, `s` contains the string '0' followed by '0'.**
