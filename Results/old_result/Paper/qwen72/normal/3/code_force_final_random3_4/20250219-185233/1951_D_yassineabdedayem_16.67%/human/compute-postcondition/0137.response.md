Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `k + Min * Max`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing three string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tab.append(str(number))` adds a new string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- Initially, `tab` contains two string representations of `number`.
- After the code is executed, `tab` contains three string representations of `number`.
- The values of `rep`, `n`, `t`, `i`, `Min`, and the conditions for updating `k` and `number` remain unchanged.
