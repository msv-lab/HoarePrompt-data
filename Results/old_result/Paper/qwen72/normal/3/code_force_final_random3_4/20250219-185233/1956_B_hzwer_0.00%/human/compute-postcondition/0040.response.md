The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `n - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 to `n - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, and `j` is n - 2.**
