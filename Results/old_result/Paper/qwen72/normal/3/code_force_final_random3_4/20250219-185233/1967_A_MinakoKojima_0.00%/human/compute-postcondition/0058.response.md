Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` with new integers provided by the user. The initial state variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The new list `a` is populated with the integers input by the user, and `m` is still the smallest integer in the list `a`.
