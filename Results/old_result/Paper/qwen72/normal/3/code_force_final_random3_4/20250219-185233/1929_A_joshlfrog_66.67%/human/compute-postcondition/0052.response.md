Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0, `y` is the minimum value in the new list `nums`.**

The value of `x` has been updated to 0. The other variables remain unchanged: `t` is still greater than 2, `e` is still 2, `l` is still the new input integer, `i` is still `l-1`, `nums` is still the list of integers provided by the user, and `y` is still the minimum value in the new list `nums`.
