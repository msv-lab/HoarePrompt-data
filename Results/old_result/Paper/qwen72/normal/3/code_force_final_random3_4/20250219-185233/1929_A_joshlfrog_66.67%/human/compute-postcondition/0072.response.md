Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `e` is 2.
   - `l` is a new input integer.
   - `i` is `l - 1`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `x` is the maximum value in `nums`.
   - `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x - y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `x` holds the maximum value in the list `nums`.
   - The variable `y` holds the minimum value in the list `nums`.
   - The `print` statement will output the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
