Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer.** 

The value of `ln` is now assigned the integer value provided by the user input. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
