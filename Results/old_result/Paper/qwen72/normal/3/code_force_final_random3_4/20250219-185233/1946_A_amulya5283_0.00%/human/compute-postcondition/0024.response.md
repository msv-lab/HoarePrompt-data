The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `t` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**
