Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for the given test cases. It uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map each 24-hour hour value to its corresponding 12-hour format, including the correct use of 'AM' and 'PM'. The program also maintains the leading zeros for hours and minutes as required. However, the program can be simplified and made more efficient by using a more concise approach, but the current implementation is functionally correct.

Correctness: **True**
