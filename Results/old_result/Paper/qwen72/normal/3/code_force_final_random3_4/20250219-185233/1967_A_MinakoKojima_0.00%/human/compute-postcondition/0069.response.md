To determine the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `_` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`
- `ans` is 0
- `a[1]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`
- `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 2, which implies `i` was 2.
4. **Next Iteration of `i`**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3.
5. **Condition for `n`**: For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is now 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, and the specific values of `a[1]` and `a[i]`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `a[1]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `i` is 3**
