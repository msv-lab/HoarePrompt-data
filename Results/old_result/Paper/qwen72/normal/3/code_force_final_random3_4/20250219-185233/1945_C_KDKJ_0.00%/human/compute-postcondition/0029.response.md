Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is equal to `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`**

Explanation: The value of `right` is assigned as the difference between the second element of the last sublist in `S` and the second element of the first sublist in `S`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `left`, `lsum`) remain unchanged.
