Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is `[0]`, `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>', `item` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [0]` resets the list `arr` to contain only the integer `0`.
- The value of `n` remains the new input integer.
- The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- The value of `maxi` remains the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
- The value of `mini` is now the largest integer from the updated `arr` (which is `[0]`) for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>'.
- The value of `item` is now the last element in the updated `arr`, which is `0`.
- The value of `_` is still incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`.
