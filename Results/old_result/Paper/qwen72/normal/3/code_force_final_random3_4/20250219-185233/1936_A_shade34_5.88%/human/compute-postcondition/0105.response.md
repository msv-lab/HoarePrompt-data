Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to `=`, otherwise `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. The output buffer has been flushed. `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the user input string, which is not equal to `<` unless the if condition is met, in which case `s` is equal to `=`.***
