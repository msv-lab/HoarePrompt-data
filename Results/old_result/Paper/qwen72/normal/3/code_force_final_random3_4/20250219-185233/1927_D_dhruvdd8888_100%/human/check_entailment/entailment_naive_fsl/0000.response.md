Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle cases where the array contains multiple segments of the same number and the query spans across these segments. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the program might not correctly identify the pairs for the queries. The logic for determining the indices `s` and `e` and the conditions for printing the indices are not robust enough to handle all edge cases, especially when the query spans multiple segments of the same number.
