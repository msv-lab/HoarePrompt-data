Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `a` and `b` are equal and both are less than or equal to `m`. According to the problem description, if both installations launch fireworks at the same frequency and this frequency is less than or equal to the visibility duration `m`, the number of fireworks visible at the same time should be `2 + m // a` (since each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes, and both installations launch fireworks at the same time). However, the program does not account for this specific case and will return incorrect results.

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
1 1 10

Expected Output:
12

Actual Output:
22
```

In this case, both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 11 minutes. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time should be 12 (one from each installation at every minute from 0 to 10). The program, however, returns 22, which is incorrect.
