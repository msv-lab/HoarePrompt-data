Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function definition `def func_1(t, test_cases):` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 2. The variable `v` is now a list of length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. The values of `t` and `test_cases` are not affected.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `v[v[v[i]]]` is equal to `i`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, the program also returns nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, the program returns nothing.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
