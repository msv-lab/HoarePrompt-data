Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the problem described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t` (stored in `x`).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Processing**:
   - For each pair of integers, it checks if `x` is less than `y`.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the minimum and maximum of the two integers for each test case, which is exactly what the problem requires.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.
