The value of `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `y` is now `nums[2]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` is `nums[2]`, `x` is the greater of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` if both are greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0.**
