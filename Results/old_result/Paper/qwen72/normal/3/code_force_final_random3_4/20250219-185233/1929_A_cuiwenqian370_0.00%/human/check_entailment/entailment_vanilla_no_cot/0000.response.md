Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). The program attempts to rearrange the array by alternating the largest and smallest elements, but this approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty.

To maximize the beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) will be maximized when the elements are in increasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    return max_beauty
```

In this corrected version, the array is sorted, and the beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized.
