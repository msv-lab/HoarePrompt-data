Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the scores by summing up the values of `a` at each position and multiplying by `(k - i)`. This approach is incorrect because the game rules state that the score increases by `a_x` at each turn, and the player can either stay at the current position or move to `p_x`. The program does not account for the possibility of staying at the current position.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Cycles**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop to follow the permutation from the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha until a cycle is detected. However, it does not correctly handle the cycles. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that the players might choose to stay at their current positions to maximize their scores.

3. **Incorrect Use of `k`**:
   - The program incorrectly uses `k` in the score calculation. The game lasts for exactly `k` turns, and the score should be calculated for each turn, not by multiplying by `(k - i)`.

4. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program uses `YES` and `NO` constants, which are not relevant to the problem. The correct outputs should be "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the game for exactly `k` turns for both Bodya and Sasha. For each turn, you should:
- Add the value of `a` at the current position to the score.
- Decide whether to stay at the current position or move to `p_x` to maximize the score.

Additionally, you need to handle cycles correctly by detecting when a player returns to a previously visited position and then calculating the score for the remaining turns based on the cycle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate(start):
            score = 0
            position = start
            visited = [0] * n
            cycle_start = -1
            cycle_sum = 0
            cycle_length = 0
            for turn in range(k):
                score += a[position - 1]
                if visited[position - 1] == 1:
                    if cycle_start == -1:
                        cycle_start = turn
                    cycle_sum += a[position - 1]
                    cycle_length += 1
                else:
                    visited[position - 1] = 1
                position = p[position - 1]
                if cycle_start != -1 and turn - cycle_start + 1 == cycle_length:
                    remaining_turns = k - turn - 1
                    full_cycles = remaining_turns // cycle_length
                    score += full_cycles * cycle_sum
                    turn += full_cycles * cycle_length
                    if turn < k:
                        for _ in range(k - turn - 1):
                            score += a[position - 1]
                            position = p[position - 1]
            return score
        
        score_bodya = simulate(pb)
        score_sasha = simulate(ps)
        
        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the game for both players, handles cycles, and determines the winner based on the final scores.
