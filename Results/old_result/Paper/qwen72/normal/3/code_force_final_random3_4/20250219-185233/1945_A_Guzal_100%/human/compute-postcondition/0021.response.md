Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the new values provided by the user, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated. If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is set to `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, `k` is set to `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.***
