Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `i` is not changed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is not changed by this code snippet.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state, so it is mentioned as being incremented by 1.
