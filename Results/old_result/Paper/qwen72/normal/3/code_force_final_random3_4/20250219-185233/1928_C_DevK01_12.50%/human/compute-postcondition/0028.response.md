The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, both of which are integers with the constraints 1 <= x < q <= 10^9. The function returns a list `M` that contains pairs of divisors of `q` and their corresponding quotients, where both the divisors and the quotients are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `q` and `x` (with 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all pairs of divisors of `q` and their corresponding quotients `q // i` where both the divisor and the quotient are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
