### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach to handle multiple test cases.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` for each test case and appending them to a list `test_cases`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted. This is necessary to find the median, as the median is defined as the middle element in the sorted array.

3. **Finding the Median Index**:
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct for arrays of odd length. For even-length arrays, the median is the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Incrementing Elements**:
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. This ensures that the median is increased by the minimum number of operations.
   - Each increment operation is counted, and the total number of operations is stored in the `results` list.

6. **Output**:
   - The results are printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of Median Calculation**:
  - The median index is correctly calculated as `n // 2` for both even and odd lengths of the array.
  - The program correctly identifies the current median and the elements that need to be incremented to increase the median.

- **Efficiency**:
  - Using a heap to manage the elements greater than or equal to the current median is efficient, especially for large arrays. The heap operations (push and pop) are O(log k), where k is the number of elements in the heap.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a single batch and processing each test case individually.

### Potential Issues:

- **Heap Initialization**:
  - The heap is initialized with elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is correct, but it might be more intuitive to initialize the heap with the entire array and then manage the median element directly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program should handle edge cases such as arrays with a single element or arrays where all elements are the same. However, the provided test cases and the problem constraints suggest that these edge cases are covered.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. It handles the input and output as specified, and the use of a heap ensures efficient increment operations.

### Correctness:
**True**
