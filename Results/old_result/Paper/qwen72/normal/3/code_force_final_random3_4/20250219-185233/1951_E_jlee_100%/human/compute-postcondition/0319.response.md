Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x`, `done` is False. If all characters in `s` are equal to `x`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state.***
