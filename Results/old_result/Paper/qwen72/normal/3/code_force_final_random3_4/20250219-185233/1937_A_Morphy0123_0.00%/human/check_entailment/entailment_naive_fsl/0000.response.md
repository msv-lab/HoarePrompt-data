Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input `n` is a power of 2 minus 1. For example, when `n = 7`, the correct position of 1 after performing the swap operations should be 4, but the program outputs 8. This is because the logic for calculating the position of 1 is flawed. The program incorrectly increments the `power` variable and then checks if `power` is equal to `n`, which is not the correct way to determine the position of 1 in the array after the swaps.
