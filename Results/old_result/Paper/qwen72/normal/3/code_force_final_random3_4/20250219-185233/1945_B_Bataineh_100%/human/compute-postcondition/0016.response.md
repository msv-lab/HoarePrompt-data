The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then the condition `m < a` and `m < b` is true. Otherwise, `m` is either greater than or equal to `a` or less than or equal to `b`.**
