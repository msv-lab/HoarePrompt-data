Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `A` is either True or False depending on the number of iterations and whether the loop was broken; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is False if any two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1, otherwise `not_c` is True; `i` is the last index of `set_` that was checked, which could be less than `len(set_) - 1` if the loop was broken, or `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completed all iterations.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the list `arr` remains unchanged. The variable `A` will be either True or False, depending on the number of iterations and whether the loop was broken early. The list `set_` also remains unchanged, and it is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with the first element being 1. The variable `not_c` will be False if any two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1, otherwise, it will be True. The variable `i` will be the last index of `set_` that was checked, which could be less than the length of `set_` minus 1 if the loop was broken early, or it will be the length of `set_` minus 1 if the loop completed all iterations.
