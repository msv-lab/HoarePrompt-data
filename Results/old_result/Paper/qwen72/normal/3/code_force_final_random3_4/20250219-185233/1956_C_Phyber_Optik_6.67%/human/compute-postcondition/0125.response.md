Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 3.
- `r` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Function**: The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. **Unpacking**: The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the sequence, so the `print` function will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Variables:
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state. However, we know it is a positive integer, so `n` could be any integer greater than 0.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces. Since `n` is a positive integer, the output will be a list of integers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer)**
