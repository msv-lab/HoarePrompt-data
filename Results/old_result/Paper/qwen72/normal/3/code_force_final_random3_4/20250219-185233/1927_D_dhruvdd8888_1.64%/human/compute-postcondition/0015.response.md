Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1, num)`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple is `(1 + s, i, num)`, which evaluates to `(1 + 0, 1, num)` or `(1, 1, num)`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the initial conditions for `N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `nums` are still valid.
