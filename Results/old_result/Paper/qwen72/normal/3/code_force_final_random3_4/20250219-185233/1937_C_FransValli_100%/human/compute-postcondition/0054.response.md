Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `arr` is a list containing at least three elements.
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `item` is the third element of `arr`.
   - `res` is an input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement starts with the string `'?'`.
   - `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`.
   - `item` is the third element of the list `arr`.
   - The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console without any buffering.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first element of `arr` is `mini`.
   - The third element of `arr` is `item`.
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mini` and `item` repeated twice each.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` repeated twice, and then the value of `item` repeated twice.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of the list `arr` and [item] is the third element of the list `arr`)**
