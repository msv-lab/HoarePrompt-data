The `print('IMPOSSIBLE')` statement will print the string 'IMPOSSIBLE' regardless of the values of the variables `suits`, `rank`, and `trumps` described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about the variables and their conditions, but it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement, which simply prints the literal string 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
