Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.**

The code snippet `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the list `cliquess` at the index `left + mid + i`. Since `i` is 1, and `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, the index `left + mid + i` is `left + (right - left) // 2 + 1`. This index is the same as the index where `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right`. Therefore, the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is now `clique`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
