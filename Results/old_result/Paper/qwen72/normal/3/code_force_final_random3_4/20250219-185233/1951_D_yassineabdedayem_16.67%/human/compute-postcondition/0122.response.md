Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`**

Explanation:
- `number` is assigned the value of `Min`, which is `min(n // k, k)`.
- The values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
- The condition `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k` remains valid.
- The value of `t` is still greater than 0 and decremented by 1.
- `tab` still contains a single string representation of `number`.
- `i` is still `None`.
- `Min` is still `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` is still `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- `n` is still `n - Min * Max`.
