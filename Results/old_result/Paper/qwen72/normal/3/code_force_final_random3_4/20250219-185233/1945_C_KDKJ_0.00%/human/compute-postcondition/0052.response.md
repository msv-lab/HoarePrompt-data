Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is equal to `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.**
