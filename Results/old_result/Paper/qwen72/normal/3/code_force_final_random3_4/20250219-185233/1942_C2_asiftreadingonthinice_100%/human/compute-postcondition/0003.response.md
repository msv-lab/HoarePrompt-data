Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `tt`, `ii`) remain unchanged, and the precondition that the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n] is still valid.
