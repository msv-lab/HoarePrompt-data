Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the range is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `lex` is now `lex - 2`, and `arr` is a list with two elements [1, 1]. If `lex` was greater than 25 but less than 52, `lex` is now `lex - 27`, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 1]. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is now `lex - 52`, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 26].**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, so it will execute exactly 2 times.
- After the first iteration:
  - If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` becomes [1] and `lex` is decremented by 1.
  - If `lex` was greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` becomes [26] and `lex` is decremented by 26.
  - If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` becomes [26] and `lex` is decremented by 26.
- After the second iteration:
  - If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` becomes [1, 1] and `lex` is decremented by 1 again, making `lex` now `lex - 2`.
  - If `lex` was greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` becomes [26, 1] and `lex` is decremented by 1, making `lex` now `lex - 27`.
  - If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` becomes [26, 26] and `lex` is decremented by 26 again, making `lex` now `lex - 52`.

Thus, after the loop completes all its iterations, the state of the variables is as described above.
