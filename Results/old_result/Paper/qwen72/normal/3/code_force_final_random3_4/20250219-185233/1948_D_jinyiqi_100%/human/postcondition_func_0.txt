The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, where the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. It processes the string to find the largest integer `j` such that there are `j` consecutive pairs of characters in `s` (at positions `k` and `k + j`) that satisfy one of the following conditions: `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. If such a `j` is found, the function prints `2 * j` and returns. If no such `j` is found after checking all possible values, the function prints `0` and returns. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
