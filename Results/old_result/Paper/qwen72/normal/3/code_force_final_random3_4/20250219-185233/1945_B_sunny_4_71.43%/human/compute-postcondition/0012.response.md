Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**

Explanation:
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
- The values of `A` and `B` are recalculated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m` using the expressions `A = int(m / a) + 1` and `B = int(m / b) + 1`.
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The placeholder variable `_` is still incremented by 1.
