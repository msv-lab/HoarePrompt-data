Reasoning:  
The provided program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints them in ascending order. The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. However, there is a potential issue with the variable names used inside the loop. The loop variable `x` is the same as the variable `x` used to store the first integer of each pair, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs. Despite this, the program will still work correctly for the given problem because the loop variable `x` is only used for iteration and does not affect the values of `x` and `y` inside the loop.

To improve clarity, it would be better to use a different variable name for the number of test cases, such as `t` or `num_test_cases`. However, this is not a correctness issue, and the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
