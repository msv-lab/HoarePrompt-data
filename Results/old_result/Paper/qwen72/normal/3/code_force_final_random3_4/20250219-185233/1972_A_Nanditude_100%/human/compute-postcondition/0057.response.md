The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is 1, and if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
