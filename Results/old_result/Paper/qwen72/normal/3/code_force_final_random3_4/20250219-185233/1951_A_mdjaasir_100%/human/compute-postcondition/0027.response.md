The `print('YES')` statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `count` because the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. The precondition only provides information about these variables but does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
