Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1. If `b[j]` < `a[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.**
