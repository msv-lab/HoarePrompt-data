The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v`, `na_frente`, and the range parameters. The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0 (inclusive) in steps of -1. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is -1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be set to the next value in the range, which is `na_frente - 1`. Since `v` was -1 at the end of the last iteration, it means the loop has just finished its first iteration where `v` was `na_frente`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `v` should be `na_frente - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user.**
