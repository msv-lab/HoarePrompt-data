Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `nodes` corresponds to a node in the tree, and the value for each key is a list containing the node's neighbors. Each node's list will contain the correct number of neighbors as per the tree structure, and the tree will have exactly two leaves. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True. `ends` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        ends.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least one key, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True. If the list associated with `key` in `nodes` has exactly one element, `ends` is a list containing the `key`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least two keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True. If the list associated with `key` in `nodes` has exactly one element, `ends` is a list containing the `key`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True. If the list associated with `key` in `nodes` has exactly one element, `ends` is a list containing the `key`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
