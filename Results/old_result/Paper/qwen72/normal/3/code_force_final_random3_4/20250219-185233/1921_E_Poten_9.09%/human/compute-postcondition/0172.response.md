Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `test_cases` from the user, indicating the number of test scenarios to process. For each test scenario, it reads six integers from the user, representing the dimensions of a grid (`h`, `w`) and two distinct points within this grid (`x_a`, `y_a` and `x_b`, `y_b`). Based on the relative positions of these points and the grid dimensions, the function determines the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob, appending 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' to a list `answers`. After processing all test scenarios, it prints each outcome in the `answers` list. The final state of the program is that `answers` contains `test_cases` strings, each representing the result of a test scenario. **
