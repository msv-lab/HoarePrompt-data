Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`).
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `arr` is the list of integers input by the user.
   - `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `itm` is the third element in `mex`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(itm, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement prints the value of `itm` and uses `end=' '` to ensure that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.
   - `itm` is defined as the third element in the `mex` list. Since `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `itm` will be the integer at index 2 of the `mex` list.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the value of the third element in the `mex` list, followed by a space.

Output: **[third element in mex] (where the third element in mex is the integer at index 2 of the mex list)**
