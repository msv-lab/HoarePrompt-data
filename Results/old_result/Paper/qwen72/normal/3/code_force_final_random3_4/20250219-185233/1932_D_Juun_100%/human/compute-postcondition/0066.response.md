The only object in the loop head is the variable `answer` and the list `answers`. For the loop to execute, `answers` must contain at least one element. The state of `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `trump`, and `suits` are not in the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the purpose of the loop execution.

State: **`answers` must contain at least one string, `answer` is the first string in `answers`**
