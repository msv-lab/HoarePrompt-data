The value of `c` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which means `c` will be a string with any leading and trailing whitespace removed from the user input. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**
