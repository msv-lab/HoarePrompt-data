The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. `res` is an input string.**
