Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `done` remains False, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**

The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `done` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the fact that the program continues to the next iteration.
