Output State: **`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `vis` remain unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
