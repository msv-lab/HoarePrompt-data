Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` and `y` are equal correctly. According to the problem description, if `x` and `y` are equal, the output should be the same number twice. However, the program's logic only checks if `x` is less than `y` or not, and does not explicitly handle the case where `x` equals `y`. This can lead to incorrect output in some cases.

For example, if the input is:
```
10
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

The program will output:
```
1 9
4 8
1 4
3 4
0 2
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

This is correct, but if the input is:
```
1
5 5
```

The program will output:
```
5 5
```

This is correct, but the issue lies in the logic not explicitly handling the equality case, which could be a potential bug in more complex scenarios. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
