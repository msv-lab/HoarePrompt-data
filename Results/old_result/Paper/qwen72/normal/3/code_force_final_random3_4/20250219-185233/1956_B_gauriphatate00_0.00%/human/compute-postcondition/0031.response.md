Output State: **`results` is a list containing all the results from `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, and the loop has printed each result in the list.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list contains all the results that were generated by calling `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration. The loop has printed each of these results to the console, one by one. The initial state variables `data`, `idx`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged or are set according to the initial conditions and the final iteration, but the loop itself has completed its task of printing all the results in the `results` list.
