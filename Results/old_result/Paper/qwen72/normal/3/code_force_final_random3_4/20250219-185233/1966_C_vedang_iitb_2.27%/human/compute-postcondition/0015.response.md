Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and a positive integer `n` where 1 <= n <= len(a). It returns either 1 or 2 based on the following conditions: If `n` is 1, it returns 1. If `n` is 2, it returns 1 if the first element of `a` is even, otherwise it returns 2. For `n` greater than 2, it recursively calls itself with the list `a` excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1. If the result of the recursive call is 2, or if it is 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 2. **
