The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, where `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers within the specified ranges. The exact return value for each test case is not provided in the output description, but it is implied that the function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. The function returns a result for each test case, with the total number of test cases `t` ranging from 1 to 10,000.**
