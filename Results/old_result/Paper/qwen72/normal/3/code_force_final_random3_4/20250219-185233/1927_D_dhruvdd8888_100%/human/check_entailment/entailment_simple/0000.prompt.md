Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the length of the array `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), the array `a` (a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and a list of queries `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5), where each query is a tuple of two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

    num = nums[0]

            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is the last element in the `nums` list (which is `-1`), and `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same number in the `nums` list, along with the number itself. The variable `s` is the index of the last segment's start position.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))

        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same number in the `nums` list, along with the number itself. The variable `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The variable `_` is the number of times the loop has executed, which is equal to the integer value provided by `int(input())`. The variable `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. The values of `s`, `e`, and `num` after the loop depends on the conditions evaluated during each iteration, but the final state will be such that the conditions for the last iteration are met.
