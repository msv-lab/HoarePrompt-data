The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an input integer - 1
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input
- `res` is 0 or 1
- `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
- `i` is `mdx`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is `mdx + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `res`, and `mdx`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `res` is 0 or 1, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`**
