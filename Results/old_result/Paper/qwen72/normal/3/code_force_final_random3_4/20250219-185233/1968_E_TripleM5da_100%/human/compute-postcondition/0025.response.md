Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than `i - 1`

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the relationship between `i` and `n`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer, and it is stated that `n` is greater than `i - 1`.
   - Substituting `i` with `n + 1` in the condition `n > i - 1`, we get:
     \[
     n > (n + 1) - 1
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     n > n
     \]
     This is a contradiction because `n` cannot be greater than itself.

2. **Conclusion**:
   - The initial state provided is logically inconsistent. The condition `n > i - 1` cannot be true if `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on the values of `i` or `n`. It simply prints the integers 1 and 2.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the integers 1 and 2, regardless of the initial state.
Output: **1, 2**
