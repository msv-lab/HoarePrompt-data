Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 3 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 3, `a[1]` is incremented by 1, `a[2]` remains unchanged, `b[1]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[1]` by 1, since `i` is 1. The values of `n`, `x`, `j`, `a[2]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x[j - 1]` do not affect the current code snippet, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
