The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1 (or the smallest value greater than 0 that the loop reaches), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + 1` if `current_sum` > `max_sum`, otherwise `max_sum` remains unchanged, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` > `max_sum`, otherwise `best_y` remains unchanged.**
