Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. Additionally, n is even, no arrows point outside the grid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not `>`, the program maintains the initial state. If the second-to-last character of `b` is `>`, and `n` is 1, the program maintains the initial state. Otherwise, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is True, it indicates that either all characters at even indices in `b` are '>', or all characters at odd indices from 1 to `n-2` in `a` are '>'. If `no_path` is False, it indicates that there is at least one character at an even index in `b` that is not '>', and there is at least one character at an odd index from 1 to `n-2` in `a` that is not '>'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `b[-2]` is not '>', `no_path` is either True or False based on the conditions provided. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is 1, `no_path` is either True or False based on the conditions provided. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is greater than 1, `no_path` is False if any character at an even index in `b` is not '>', and if `no_path` is False, then `k` is the last odd number less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True. If the initial value of `no_path` is True, it remains True. If the initial value of `no_path` is False, it remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `b[-2]` is not '>', `no_path` remains either True or False based on the initial conditions. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is 1, `no_path` remains either True or False based on the initial conditions. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` was initially True, it remains True. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` was initially False, `k` is updated to the last odd number less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
