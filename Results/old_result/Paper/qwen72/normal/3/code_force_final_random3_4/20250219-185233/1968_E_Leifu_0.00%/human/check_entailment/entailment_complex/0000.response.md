Reasoning:  
The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program provided attempts to achieve this by printing specific pairs of coordinates for each test case. However, the approach used in the program does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

1. **Initial Pairs**:
   - The program always prints the pairs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. This is a good start because it introduces a distance of 1 (i.e., \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)).

2. **Handling \(n = 3\)**:
   - For \(n = 3\), the program prints `(2, 3)`. This introduces distances of 2 and 3, which are the maximum possible distances for \(n = 3\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct.

3. **Handling \(n \geq 4\)**:
   - For \(n \geq 4\), the program prints `(2, 4)` and then pairs `(j, j)` for \(j\) ranging from 4 to \(n\).
   - The pair `(2, 4)` introduces a distance of 3 (i.e., \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 3\)).
   - The pairs `(j, j)` for \(j\) ranging from 4 to \(n\) introduce distances of 0 (i.e., \(|j-j| + |j-j| = 0\)) and \(2 \times (j-4)\) for \(j > 4\). This does not maximize the set of distinct distances.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the program should aim to introduce as many distinct distances as possible. One effective strategy is to place the points along the diagonals and edges of the grid to ensure a wide range of distances.

For example, a better approach for \(n \geq 4\) would be to place points at:
- `(1, 1)`
- `(1, n)`
- `(n, 1)`
- `(n, n)`
- And then fill in the remaining points in a way that maximizes the number of distinct distances.

Given the current implementation, it does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), especially for \(n \geq 4\).

Correctness: **False**
