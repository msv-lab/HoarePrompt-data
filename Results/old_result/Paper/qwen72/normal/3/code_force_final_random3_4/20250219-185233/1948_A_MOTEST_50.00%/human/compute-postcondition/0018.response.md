Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 6, `ans` is 'AABBCD', `x` is 2, `j` is 2.**

The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index 2 of the string `s` (which is 'C') twice to the string `ans`. Initially, `ans` was 'AABB', and after the execution, `ans` becomes 'AABBCD'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
