### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly parses the input for each test case, converting the necessary inputs to integers and lists.

2. **Path Tracing:**
   - The function traces the path for both Bodya and Sasha through the permutation `p` and the array `a`. It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The paths are stored in `pathb` and `paths` lists, which contain the scores (`a` values) at each step of the path.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score for each player over `k` turns. It does this by iterating through the path and computing the score for each possible number of moves (from 0 to `k`).
   - The score calculation is done using a cumulative sum (`preb` and `pres`) and a formula that multiplies the current score by the remaining number of turns (`k - i`).

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the function compares them and prints the result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the number of turns `k` is less than the length of the path, ensuring that it does not attempt to access out-of-bounds indices.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the paths are cyclic, as it breaks the loop when a position is revisited.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The function is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only iterates through the paths and does not perform unnecessary operations.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" problem. It correctly parses the input, traces the paths, calculates the scores, and determines the winner. The execution summary also confirms that the function behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
