Postcondition: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is not equal to infinity.**
