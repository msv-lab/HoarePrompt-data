Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 2.
   - `l` and `r` are the integers provided by the user input.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The user provides two integers, `l` and `r`, where `int(input())` must be greater than 2. This means `l` and `r` are both integers greater than 2.
   - `eli` is determined by finding the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `LA` is the length of the list `arr`.
   - The index `min(eli, LA)` is used to access the tuple in `arr`. Since `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted, and `LA` is the length of `arr`, `min(eli, LA)` will be the index of the tuple in `arr` that is the closest to where `(l, 0, 0)` would fit.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The `print` statement outputs `s - 1` and `s`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, the output will be `s - 1` followed by `s`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact values of `s - 1` and `s` depend on the specific tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - Without the exact values of `arr` and the user inputs `l` and `r`, we can only describe the output in terms of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`)**
