### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This is because each screen can fit up to 2 2x2 icons (since 2 * 4 = 8 cells, which is less than 15 cells).
     - `x` is then adjusted by subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons that can fit on the screens. The formula used is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This is incorrect because it should be `x - bxsfory * 4 + y * 4`.
     - `bxsfory1` is calculated as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15, plus 1 if `x` is greater than 0. This is also incorrect because it should not add 1 if `x` is greater than 0.
     - The total number of screens is then printed as `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The number of screens required is simply the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is correct.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - The number of screens required is the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is correct.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The number of screens required is 0, which is correct.

3. **Function 3 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: It loops `t` times and calls `func_2()` for each test case.
   - **Output**: The output for each test case is handled correctly by `func_2()`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation in Case 1**:
  - The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x - bxsfory * 4` to correctly account for the cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
  - The formula `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` without the additional `+ 1`.

### Corrected Function 2:
```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in the calculation for the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
