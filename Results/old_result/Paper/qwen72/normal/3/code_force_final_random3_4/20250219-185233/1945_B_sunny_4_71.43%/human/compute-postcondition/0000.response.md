Output State: **The function should take three parameters a, b, and m, where a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer t as the first parameter, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases. `t` is now an input integer between 1 and 10^4.**
