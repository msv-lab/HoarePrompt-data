Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, and `j` is 1. If the first character of `x` is 'F', `a[1]` is increased by 2. If the first character of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` is incremented by 1. If the first character of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes are made to `a[1]` or `b[1]`.***
