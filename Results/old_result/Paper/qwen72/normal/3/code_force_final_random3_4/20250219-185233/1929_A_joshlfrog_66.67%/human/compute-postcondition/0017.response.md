Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to `nums[1]`. If `nums[0]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to the value of `nums[0]`. If `nums[1]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to `nums[1]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.***
