Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 \leq t \leq 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9, representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.**
