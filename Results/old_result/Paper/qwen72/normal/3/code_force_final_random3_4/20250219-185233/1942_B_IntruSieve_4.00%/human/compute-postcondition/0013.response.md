Output State: **`minn` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0.** 

The code appends the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` (which is 0) to the list `mex`. Since `minn` is 0, the value appended to `mex` is the absolute value of the first element of `arr`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
