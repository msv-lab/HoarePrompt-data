### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case within a loop.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, which is appropriate.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `a` for the cows.
   - The variable `wins` is initialized to 0 to count the number of matches your cow can win without any swaps.

3. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the list `a` to count how many matches your cow can win without any swaps.
   - The loop breaks when it encounters a cow with a higher rating than your cow.
   - This part of the program correctly calculates the number of wins your cow can achieve if it stays in its initial position.

4. **Win with Swap Calculation:**
   - If the number of wins without any swaps (`wins`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `wins - 1` and returns.
   - This is because if your cow can win all the matches up to its initial position, it will win `wins - 1` matches (since it starts at position 1 and the first match is between positions 1 and 2).
   - If `wins` is less than `k`, the program calculates the number of wins your cow can achieve if it is swapped to a position where it can win more matches.
   - The variable `win_with_swap` is initialized to `wins + 1` to account for the initial win plus the potential additional wins from the swap.
   - The program then iterates from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1` to count how many additional matches your cow can win after the swap.
   - The loop breaks when it encounters a cow with a higher rating than your cow.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve, either without any swaps or with the optimal swap.
   - The expression `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0))` is used to determine the maximum wins.
   - This expression correctly handles the case where `wins` is 0, ensuring that the program does not return a negative value.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the problem description and the given constraints. It accurately calculates the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve, either without any swaps or with the optimal swap. The logic and the implementation are sound.

**Correctness: **True****
