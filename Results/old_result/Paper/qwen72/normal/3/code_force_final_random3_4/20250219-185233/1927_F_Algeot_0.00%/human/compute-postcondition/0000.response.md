Output State: **The recursion limit is set to 1,000,000. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1)/2, 2·10^5), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. Each edge is represented by a tuple (u, v, w) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6, indicating that vertices u and v are connected by an edge of weight w. The graph does not contain loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
