### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Cumulative Count Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads the integer `n` and the string `a` for each test case.
   - It initializes a list `S` with a starting point `[0, 0]` to store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - It iterates through the string `a`, updating the cumulative counts and appending them to `S`.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program then iterates through possible positions `i` for the road.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total left side houses and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total right side houses.
   - If the conditions are not met, it continues to the next position.
   - If the conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to `n / 2` than the previously found position.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the position `ans` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to `n / 2`.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The condition `left * 2 < lsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied.
- The condition `right * 2 < rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied.
- The program correctly updates `ans` to the position that is closest to `n / 2` among all valid positions.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.
- It correctly initializes `ans` to 0, which is the default value if no valid position is found.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given conditions.
- The cumulative count calculation and the condition checks are accurate.
- The program ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible while satisfying the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
