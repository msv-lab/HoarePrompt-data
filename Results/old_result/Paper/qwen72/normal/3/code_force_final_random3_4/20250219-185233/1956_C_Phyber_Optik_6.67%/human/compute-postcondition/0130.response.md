Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last positive integer input, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is `n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` for each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the outer loop, `t` will be decremented to 0 because the loop runs `t` times.
- **`n` is the last positive integer input**: The value of `n` will be the last integer input provided by the user during the last iteration of the loop.
- **`i` is `n + 1`**: The inner loop runs from `1` to `n`, so after the inner loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- **`j` is `n + r`**: The second inner loop runs from `1` to `n + r`, so after this loop completes, `j` will be `n + r + 1`. However, since the loop prints values and then increments `j`, the final value of `j` will be `n + r + 1` but the last printed value will be `n + r`.
- **`r` is `n`**: The variable `r` is set to the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true. If the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` will be `n`.
- **`sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` for each iteration**: The variable `sum` accumulates the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, and the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` is false. This is done for each iteration of the outer loop.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
