Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, the function checks if the list contains the integer 1. If 1 is present, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program includes the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` as described in the annotations, but these variables are not returned or further used. The function's primary purpose is to determine and print the winner ("Bob" or "Alice") for each test case based on the presence of the integer 1 in the list of stones. **
