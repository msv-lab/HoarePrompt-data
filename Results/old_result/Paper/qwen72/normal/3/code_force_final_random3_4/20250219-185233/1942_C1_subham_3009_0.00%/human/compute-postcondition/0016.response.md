The code snippet `[n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())` reads a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer, assigning these values to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. This means the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 3` and `t` must be at least 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `y` is the third integer from the new input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the first `x` strings in the original `arr`, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.**
