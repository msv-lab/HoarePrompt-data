To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was not equal to `v2`.
2. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was equal to `v2`.
3. `ops` is a list that must contain all the tuples it initially had.
4. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements, which are the remaining elements after all iterations of the loop.
5. `v1` and `v2` are the last values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the loop condition fails.
6. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` before the loop condition fails.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`p1` and `p2` Construction**:
   - `p1` is constructed by taking the initial elements of `vx` and appending `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was not equal to `v2`.
   - `p2` is constructed by appending `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was equal to `v2`.

2. **`p1[::-1]`**:
   - This reverses the list `p1`.

3. **`p1[::-1] + p2`**:
   - This concatenates the reversed `p1` list with the `p2` list.

4. **`map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)`**:
   - This converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.

5. **`' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**:
   - This joins the string representations of the elements in the concatenated list with a space.

6. **`'! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**:
   - This formats the string to include an exclamation mark followed by the joined string.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output a string that starts with an exclamation mark followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order and then the elements of `p2`, all separated by spaces.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the values of `p1` and `p2` as they are constructed based on the given conditions.

Output: **! [reversed elements of p1] [elements of p2] (where the elements of p1 and p2 are determined by the conditions described in the initial state)**
