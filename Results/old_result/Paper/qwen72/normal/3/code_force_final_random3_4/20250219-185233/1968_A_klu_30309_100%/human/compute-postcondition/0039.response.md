The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `y` and `x`. The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `y` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 1`, and `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` is now `x - 2`.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is `1 + (x - 1)`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `1 + (x - 1)`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains 0 and the loop or if statement continues.**
