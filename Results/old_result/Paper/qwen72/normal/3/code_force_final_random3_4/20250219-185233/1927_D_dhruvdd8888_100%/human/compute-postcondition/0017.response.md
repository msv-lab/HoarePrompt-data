Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`, `s` is 0 unless `nums[i] != num`, in which case `s` is 1 and `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1, 1, num)` at the end. If `nums[i] == num` and `arr` initially contained an additional tuple `(1, 0, num)` at the end, this tuple remains unchanged.***
