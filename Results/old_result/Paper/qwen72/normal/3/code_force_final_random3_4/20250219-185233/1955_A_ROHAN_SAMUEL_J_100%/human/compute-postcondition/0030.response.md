Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to integers provided by the input.
   - `_` is 2.
   - The input values for `n`, `a`, and `b` must be greater than 1.
   - If `n` is odd, the condition \(2 \times a < b\) holds if \(2 \times a < b\); otherwise, the condition \(2 \times a \geq b\) holds.
   - If `n` is even, the condition \(2 \times a < b\) holds if \(2 \times a < b\); otherwise, the condition \(2 \times a \geq b\) holds.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(n // 2 * b)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division.
   - The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The value of `n` is provided by the input and must be greater than 1.
   - The value of `b` is also provided by the input and must be greater than 1.
   - The condition \(2 \times a < b\) or \(2 \times a \geq b\) is checked based on whether `n` is odd or even, but this condition does not affect the value of `n // 2 * b`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is the value of n and b is the value of b)**
