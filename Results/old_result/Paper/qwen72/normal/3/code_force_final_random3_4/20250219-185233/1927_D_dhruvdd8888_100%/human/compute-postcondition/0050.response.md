Output State: **`_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1), `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]` reassigns the values of `s`, `e`, and `_` based on the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The value of `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The value of `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The value of `_` is now the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1).
- The other variables (`int(input())`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `LA`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
