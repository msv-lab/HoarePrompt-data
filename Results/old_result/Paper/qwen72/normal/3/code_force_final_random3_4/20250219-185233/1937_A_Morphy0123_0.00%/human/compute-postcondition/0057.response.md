Output State: **`i` is `n_cases - 1`, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program maintains the initial state. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\) if `power` is equal to `n`, or greater than \(2^{(power-2)}\) if `power` is not equal to `n`. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\). If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is updated to \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The loop counter `i` has reached `n_cases - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `n_cases` times.
- The total number of test cases `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 0.
- For each test case, the value of `n` is an input integer.
- If `n` is 1, the program simply prints 1 and maintains the initial state.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. If this power is equal to `n`, it prints \(2^{\text{power}}\). Otherwise, it prints \(2^{\text{power}-1}\).
- The state of `n` and `power` for each test case is determined by the logic described above, and this logic is applied consistently for all `n_cases` iterations.
