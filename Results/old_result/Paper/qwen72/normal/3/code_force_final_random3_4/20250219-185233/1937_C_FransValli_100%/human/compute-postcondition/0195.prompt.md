Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is part of an interactive problem where the input is a sequence of test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). The hidden permutation p is a list of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR results, and must eventually output a pair of indices "! i j" such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>', `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>', `item` is the last element in `arr`, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`, `res` is the final input string. If `res` is not '>', `mini` remains the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
