### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It correctly parses the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format and stores the test cases in a list.

2. **Processing Test Cases (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case in the `test_cases` list.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x` and adjusted to be non-negative. This is correct because it ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - It calculates `ry` as `a % y`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`. This is correct because it ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`. This is correct because it counts the number of elements `a_j` that form a beautiful pair with `a_i`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`. This is correct because it keeps track of the frequency of pairs that can form beautiful pairs with future elements.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Output (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints the results for each test case.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the output format and prints the results as required.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **State Before `func_1` Call:**
  - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are within the specified ranges, and `arr` is a list of integers of length `n`.
  - This state is correctly described and matches the problem description.

- **State Inside `func_1` Loop:**
  - `freq` is a dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
  - `count` is a counter that counts the number of beautiful pairs.
  - The loop iterates over each element `a` in the array `arr`.
  - `rx` and `ry` are calculated correctly to ensure the conditions for a beautiful pair are met.
  - The dictionary `freq` is updated correctly to keep track of the pairs.
  - The `count` is updated correctly by adding the frequency of the pair `(rx, ry)` if it exists in `freq`.

- **State After `func_1` Loop:**
  - `results` is a list containing the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`.
  - `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.
  - This state is correctly described and matches the logic of the program.

- **State Before `func_2` Output:**
  - `t` is greater than 0.
  - `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`.
  - `results` is a list containing all the elements that were returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.
  - The loop prints each element in `results` exactly once.
  - This state is correctly described and matches the expected behavior of the program.

The given program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. The original assessment is accurate.
