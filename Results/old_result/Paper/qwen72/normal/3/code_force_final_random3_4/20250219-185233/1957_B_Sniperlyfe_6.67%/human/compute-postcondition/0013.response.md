The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n`. Each element in the list, except the last one, is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The last element of the list is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\).

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element, except the last, is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The last element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\).**
