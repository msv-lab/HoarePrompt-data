Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 2` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `max_sum` is unchanged, `best_y` is unchanged.** 

The code snippet updates `current_sum` to the value of `gcd_val + y`. Since `y` is `x - 2`, `current_sum` is now `gcd_val + (x - 2)`. However, the code does not update `max_sum` or `best_y` unless `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, which is not checked in the given code snippet. Therefore, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. All other initial conditions remain valid.
