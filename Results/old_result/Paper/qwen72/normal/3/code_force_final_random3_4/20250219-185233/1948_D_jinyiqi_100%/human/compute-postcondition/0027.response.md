Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2, and `n - j` must be greater than 2. If `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 0 if the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is false, and `count` is 1 if the condition is true but `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not question marks and are not equal. In all cases, `count` is not equal to `j`. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns nothing.***
