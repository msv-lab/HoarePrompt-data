You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise math.ceil(x / 15) + 1, and bxsfory is math.ceil(y / 2))
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer between 1 and 99, and math.ceil(y / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to y / 2)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is an integer between 1 and 99, and the result is an integer between 1 and 7)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: *`x` and `y` are assigned the values of two input integers, each between 0 and 99 (inclusive), and at least one of `x` or `y` is 0 or less. Additionally, either `x` is not 0, or `y` is 0 or less. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then `y` remains 0. Otherwise, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
        #State: *`x` and `y` are assigned the values of two input integers, each between 0 and 99 (inclusive), and at least one of `x` or `y` is 0 or less. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains greater than 0. Otherwise, either `x` is not 0, or `y` is 0 or less. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then `y` remains 0. In all other cases, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
    #State: *`x` and `y` are assigned the values of two input integers, each between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If at least one of `x` or `y` is 0 or less, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, except in the case where `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, in which case `y` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a value based on the relationship between two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99), but the specific return values are not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
