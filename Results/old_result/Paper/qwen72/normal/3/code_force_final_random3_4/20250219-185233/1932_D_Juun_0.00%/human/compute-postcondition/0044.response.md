Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not `None`. If `rank` was not `None` in the previous iteration, `suit` and `rank` are now the next key-value pair in `suits` where `rank` is not `None`. If `rank` was `None`, `suit` and `rank` are the next key-value pair in `suits` regardless of the value of `rank`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
