The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state and will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
