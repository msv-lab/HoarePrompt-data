Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the precondition).
   - `i` is 0 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the precondition).
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user.
   - `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement is `print(2 + m // b)`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - `m` is an integer that is greater than `b` and less than `a`.
   - `m // b` performs integer division, which means it divides `m` by `b` and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.
   - The result of `m // b` is added to 2.

Since `m` is greater than `b`, the integer division `m // b` will result in a non-negative integer. The exact value of `m // b` depends on the specific values of `m` and `b`, but it will always be an integer.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **2 + m // b (where m is an integer greater than b and less than a, and m // b is the integer division of m by b)**
