Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` is a list that includes the string 'Draw' as its last element. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice'.***
