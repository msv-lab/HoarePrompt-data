You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, as it does not have any parameters defined. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a in each test case is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration and has been incremented by `t` times, `n` is the input integer from the last test case, `ar` is a list of integers from the last test case with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar` that was processed, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`, and `minn` is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in all the test cases. If `minn` is `inf`, it indicates that there were no sequences of consecutive same numbers in any of the test cases. Otherwise, `minn` is the smallest length of such sequences found across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes each test case and outputs the result to standard output.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
