The value of `i` is 3, and `arr.append(i)` adds this value to the list `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is [2] if the new `res` is '<' or '=', and [1] otherwise. After appending `i` (which is 3), `arr` will be [2, 3] if `res` is '<' or '=', and [1, 3] otherwise. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and `res` is still the new input string.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '<' or '=', `arr` is [2, 3]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1, 3].**
