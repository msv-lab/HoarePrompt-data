Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is `int(w // 1)`. `M` is a list that contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients `q // i` that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`q` and `w`**: The value of `q` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and `w` is the square root of `q`. The loop runs for `i` values from 1 to `int(w // 1) - 1`, so `w` must be greater than or equal to `x - 1` to ensure that the loop runs at least once.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `int(w // 1)`, which is the upper bound of the loop.
- **`M`**: The list `M` will contain all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. For each divisor `i` of `q`, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it will be added to `M`. Additionally, if the quotient `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it will also be added to `M`. This means `M` will include all such divisors and their corresponding quotients.
