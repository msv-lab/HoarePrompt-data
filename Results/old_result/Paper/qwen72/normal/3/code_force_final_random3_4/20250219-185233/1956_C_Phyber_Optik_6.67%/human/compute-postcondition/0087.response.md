The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop can execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is not used in the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `t` is the one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 499. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` will now be an integer between 0 and 498.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.**
