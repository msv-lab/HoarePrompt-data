Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` updates the value of `y` to be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`.
- If '1' is not found in the reversed string `arr`, `y` is set to -1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `z` is still defined as the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive), but `y` has been updated.
