#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each tuple, `1 <= n <= 50` and `1 <= m <= 5`.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0. It does not modify any external state or variables.
