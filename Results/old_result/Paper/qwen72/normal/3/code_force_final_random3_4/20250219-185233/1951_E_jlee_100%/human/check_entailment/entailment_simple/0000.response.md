Reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `string` and converts it to a list of characters `s`.

2. **Single Character String**:
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the function correctly prints "NO" because a single character is always a palindrome.
   - This check is necessary and correctly handled.

3. **First and Last Character Check**:
   - If the first and last characters of the string `s[0]` and `s[-1]` are different, the function correctly prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - This is a valid check because if the first and last characters are different, the string cannot be a palindrome.

4. **All Characters the Same**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same (i.e., `s.count(x) == n`), the function correctly prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.
   - This check is necessary and correctly handled.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same**:
   - If all but one character in the string are the same (i.e., `s.count(x) == n - 1`), the function checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - This check is necessary because if the middle character is different, it would still form a palindrome if the string is odd in length.

6. **General Case**:
   - The function iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from `x` and sets `count` to its index.
   - It then continues to find the next character that is different from `x` and sets `count2` to the number of characters equal to `x` after the first non-`x` character.
   - Based on the values of `count` and `count2`, it prints the appropriate partition:
     - If `count2 < count`, it prints "YES" and the partition `string[:j]` and `string[j:]`.
     - If `count2 == count` and `count > 1`, it prints "YES" and the partition `string[:j - 1]` and `string[j - 1:]`.
     - If `count2 > count`, it prints "YES" and the partition `string[:j]` and `string[j:]`.
   - If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as single character strings and strings with all characters the same correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all but one character are the same correctly by checking the middle character for odd-length strings.

8. **Complexity**:
   - The function iterates through the string once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, where `n` is the length of the string.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to handle all the specified cases correctly and efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
