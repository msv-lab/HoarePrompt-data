To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n
- `left` is `n`
- `right` is `-1`
- `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order
- `max_beauty` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` should be set to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order, `max_beauty` is 0**
