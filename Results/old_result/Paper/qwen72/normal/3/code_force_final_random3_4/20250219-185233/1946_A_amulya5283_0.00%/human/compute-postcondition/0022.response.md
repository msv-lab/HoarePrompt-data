Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `median_index` remain unchanged.
- `current_median` is still the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`.
- The `heap` initially contained elements from `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end. After the loop executes, the `heap` will still contain these elements, but any elements that were less than or equal to `current_median` have been incremented by 1 each time they were popped from the heap and then pushed back. The loop continues until all elements in the heap are greater than `current_median`.
- `operations` is the total number of times the loop executed, which is the number of times an element was popped from the heap and incremented.
