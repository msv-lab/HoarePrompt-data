### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones, and players take turns to remove a positive integer \( k \) of stones from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and we need to determine the winner assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function transforms the list of pile sizes into a new list where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list of unique pile sizes.
   - **Behavior**: 
     - It first sorts the unique elements of the list `a`.
     - Then, it modifies the list such that each element at index \( i \) (for \( i \geq 1 \)) is reduced by the value of the element at index \( i-1 \).
   - **Output**: The function returns a new list `a_new` where the elements are the differences as described.
   - **Correctness**: This transformation is crucial because it simplifies the problem by reducing the pile sizes to a form where the game can be more easily analyzed. The transformation is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list of pile sizes.
   - **Behavior**:
     - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can always remove all stones from that pile.
     - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), Alice wins if the first pile size is even, otherwise Bob wins. This is because if the first pile size is even, Alice can always remove an even number of stones, leaving Bob with an odd number, and vice versa.
     - For more than two piles, the function recursively calls itself with the list excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1. It then determines the winner based on the result of the recursive call and the value of the first element.
   - **Correctness**: The recursive logic is correct. It effectively reduces the problem to smaller subproblems and uses the results to determine the winner. The base cases and the recursive step are well-defined and align with the optimal play strategy.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles and the pile sizes, applies `func_1` to transform the pile sizes, and then uses `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The output is printed as "Alice" or "Bob" based on the result of `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle the problem's constraints and produce the correct results.

**Correctness: True**
