Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `vis` to a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This overrides the previous state where `vis` had elements set to 1 at the indices visited by `pb` during the loop iterations. All other variables remain unchanged.
