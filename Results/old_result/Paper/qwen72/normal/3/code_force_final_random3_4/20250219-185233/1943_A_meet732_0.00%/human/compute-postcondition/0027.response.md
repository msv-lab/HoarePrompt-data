Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues as it was before the if statement.***
