Postcondition: ***`rep` is 60 or less, `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `t` is 0 or a positive integer, `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration. If `k` is 0, `i` is the last element in `tab`, and `tab` has been fully iterated. If `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `None`. In both cases, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed.***
