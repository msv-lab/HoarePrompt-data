Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n`, `r` is 0, `j` is `n + 0 + 1` (or `n + 1`), `sum` is 0.** 

The code snippet sets `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is now `n + 1` because `r` is set to 0.
