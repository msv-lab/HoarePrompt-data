### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Cumulative Count Calculation**:
   - `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` to store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - It iterates through the string `a`, updating the cumulative counts and appending them to `S`.
   - This part of the function correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a`.

2. **Condition Checking and Answer Calculation**:
   - The function then iterates through each possible position `i` where the road can be laid (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's (`left`) and '1's (`right`) on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
   - It also checks if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` to the current position `i` if `i` is closer to `n / 2` than the current `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - After checking all possible positions, the function prints the value of `ans`, which is the index `i` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to `n / 2`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the function is run for each input.

### Correctness:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
- It correctly checks the conditions for each possible position of the road.
- It correctly updates the answer to the position that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the conditions.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**
