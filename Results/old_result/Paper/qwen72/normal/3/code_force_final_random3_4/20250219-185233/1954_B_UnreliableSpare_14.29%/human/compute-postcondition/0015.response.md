Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `flag` remains True. If `arr[3]` is not equal to `arr[2]`, `flag` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
