Output State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and non-'0's (respectively) in the string `a` up to that point.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged.
- The string `a` must have at least `n` characters.
- The list `S` will have `n + 1` sublists, where the first sublist is `[0, 0]`.
- Each subsequent sublist in `S` will contain two integers: the first integer is the cumulative count of '0's encountered so far in the string `a`, and the second integer is the cumulative count of all other characters (non-'0's) encountered so far in the string `a`.
