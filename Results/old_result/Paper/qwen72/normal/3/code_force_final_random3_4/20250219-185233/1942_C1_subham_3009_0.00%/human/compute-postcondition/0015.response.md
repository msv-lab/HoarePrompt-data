Output State: **`t` is `t - 3` and `t` must be at least 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the first `x` strings in the original `arr`, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is `t - 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
