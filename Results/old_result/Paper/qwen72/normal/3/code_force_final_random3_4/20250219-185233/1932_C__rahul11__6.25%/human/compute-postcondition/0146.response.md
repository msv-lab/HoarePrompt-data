The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the array `a`.
- An integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4) for the modulus operation.
- A list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4) representing the elements of the array.
- A string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given parameters.**
