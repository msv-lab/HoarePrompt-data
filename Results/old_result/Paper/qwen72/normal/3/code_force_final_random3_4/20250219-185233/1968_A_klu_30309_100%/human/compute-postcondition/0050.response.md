Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 3, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `best_y` is `x - 3`, and the loop or if statement continues.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `best_y = y` assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`.
- Since `y` is defined as `x - 3`, `best_y` now holds the value `x - 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
