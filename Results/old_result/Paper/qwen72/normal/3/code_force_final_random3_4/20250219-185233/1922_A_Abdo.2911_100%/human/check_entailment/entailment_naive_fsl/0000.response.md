Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw. It does not correctly handle the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, and `c[i]` is also different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. According to the problem description, in such a case, it should be possible to construct a template where `a` and `b` match, but `c` does not. However, the program incorrectly sets `possible` to `True` in this case, which may lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
In this case:
- `a[0]` is 'a', `b[0]` is 'd', and `c[0]` is 'g'. All are different.
- `a[1]` is 'b', `b[1]` is 'e', and `c[1]` is 'h'. All are different.
- `a[2]` is 'c', `b[2]` is 'f', and `c[2]` is 'i'. All are different.

The program will set `possible` to `True` for the first character and print "YES". However, there is no valid template that can match both `a` and `b` while not matching `c` because all characters in `a`, `b`, and `c` are different. Therefore, the correct output should be "NO".

This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
