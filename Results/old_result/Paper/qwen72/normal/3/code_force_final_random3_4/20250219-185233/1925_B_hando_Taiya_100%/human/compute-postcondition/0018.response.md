Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of `x // 2` (if `x` is divisible by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`) and 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `i`.
- Initially, `ans` is set to `x // 2` if `x` is divisible by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 3.
- Therefore, `ans` is now the maximum of its previous value (which could be `x // 2` or 0) and 3.
- If `ans` was `x // 2` and `x // 2` is greater than 3, `ans` remains `x // 2`.
- If `ans` was 0, `ans` is now 3.
- If `ans` was `x // 2` and `x // 2` is less than or equal to 3, `ans` is now 3.
- The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged.
