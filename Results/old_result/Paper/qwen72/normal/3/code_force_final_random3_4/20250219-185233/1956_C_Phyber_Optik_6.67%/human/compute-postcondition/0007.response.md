Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its previous value, which was 0. Therefore, `sum` is now equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` still holds true.
