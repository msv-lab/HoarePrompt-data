Reasoning:  
The program aims to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the beauty, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The approach taken by the program is to sort the array and then construct a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This strategy ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The problem statement requires the beauty to be calculated as \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), but the program calculates the beauty using the absolute differences \(|a_i - a_{i-1}|\). This means the program is actually solving a different problem where the beauty is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

To correctly solve the problem as stated, the beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without taking the absolute value. This would mean that the optimal solution is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty directly.

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct output for the problem as described. For example, in the first test case, the correct output should be 2, but the program will output 4 because it calculates the absolute differences.

Correctness: **False**
