Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers into the list `test_cases`. This ensures that the input is handled as specified in the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of integers). The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, the function initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1. This is a reasonable starting point because `y` must be at least 1.

4. **Finding the Best y**: The function iterates over the range from `x - 1` down to 1. For each `y` in this range, it calculates the GCD of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd(x, y)`, and then computes the sum `gcd_val + y`. If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current `y`.

5. **Early Termination**: The function includes a `break` statement after updating `max_sum` and `best_y`. This is incorrect because it terminates the loop early, potentially missing a larger sum that could be found with a smaller `y`. The goal is to find the `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y`, and the loop should continue to check all possible values of `y` to ensure the maximum sum is found.

6. **Appending Results**: After the loop, the function appends `best_y` to the `results` list.

7. **Return Statement**: The function returns the `results` list, which contains the best `y` for each test case.

Given the early termination with the `break` statement, the program may not always find the correct `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
