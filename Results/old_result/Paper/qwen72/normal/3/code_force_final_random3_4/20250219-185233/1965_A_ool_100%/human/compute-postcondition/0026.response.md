Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `A` is either the opposite of its previous value if `not_c` is True, or remains unchanged if `not_c` is False; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is True if no two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1, otherwise it is False; `i` is the last index of `set_` that was checked, which could be less than `len(set_) - 1` if the loop was broken, or `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completed all iterations.***
