The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`. If `res` is '=', then `res` is set to '=' and `arr` is `[0, 1]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `res` remains not '<' and `arr` is `[0, 1]`.**
