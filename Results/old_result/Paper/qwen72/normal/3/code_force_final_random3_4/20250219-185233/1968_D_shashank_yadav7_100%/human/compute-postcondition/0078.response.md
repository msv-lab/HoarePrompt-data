Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -2 or decreased by 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.
- The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement (`k` is 0) is still valid if `k` is 0.
