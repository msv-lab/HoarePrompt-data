The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate a sequence of four integers `p_i` where each `p_i` is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, and an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but may internally use or generate a sequence of four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200) and an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). The return value is not specified.**
