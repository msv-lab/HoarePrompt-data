The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `test_cases`. `t` represents the number of test cases, and must be within the range 1 to 10^4. Each inner list in `test_cases` represents a test case and contains integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each `a_i` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is the length of the inner list. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to whether the respective inner list (test case) is a beautiful array. A beautiful array is defined by the problem constraints, but the function's output is based on these constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `test_cases`. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether the corresponding inner list in `test_cases` is a beautiful array.**
