The provided code snippet reads a line from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`. This operation does not modify the variables `t`, `test_cases`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. However, it does introduce a new variable `input` which holds the string read from the standard input.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the length of the array `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), the array `a` (a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and a list of queries `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5), where each query is a tuple of two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `input` is a string read from the standard input.**
