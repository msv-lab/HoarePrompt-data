Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is a list containing the indices for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<`. `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- `pans` remains a list containing the indices for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak` is set to 0.
- `mak2` remains equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
