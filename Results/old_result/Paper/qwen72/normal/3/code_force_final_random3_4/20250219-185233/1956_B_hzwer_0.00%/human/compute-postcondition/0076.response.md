Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1), `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `-1`. For each `j` from `n - 1` down to `0`, if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, and `j` has been decremented from `n - 1` to `-1`.
- For each value of `j` from `n - 1` down to `0`, the `dp` table has been updated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list:
  - If `j + 1` is not in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` remains the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`.
  - If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
  - If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `cards` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
