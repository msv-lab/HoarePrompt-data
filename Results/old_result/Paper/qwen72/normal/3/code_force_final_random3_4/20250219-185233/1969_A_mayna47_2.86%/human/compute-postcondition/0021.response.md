Postcondition: ***The function definition `def func_1(t, test_cases):` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is an input integer. The variable `v` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. The values of `t` and `test_cases` are not affected. If `n` is 2, the program does not modify `v` and returns nothing. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is set to `n`, and the program iterates from `i` down to 0. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` at any iteration, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program completes the loop and returns nothing.***
