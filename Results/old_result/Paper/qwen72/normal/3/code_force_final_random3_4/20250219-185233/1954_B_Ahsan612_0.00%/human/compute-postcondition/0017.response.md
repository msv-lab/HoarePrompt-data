The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than the length of the list `ar`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 or 3, and `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given that `i` is 2 or 3, and `ar` has at least 2 elements, the loop can only execute one more time if `i` is 2 and `len(ar)` is greater than 2, or if `i` is 3 and `len(ar)` is greater than 3.

Since the state provided does not specify the exact value of `i` but only that it is 2 or 3, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 3 to guarantee that the loop can execute one more time regardless of whether `i` is 2 or 3.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `len(ar)` is greater than 3.

State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2 or 3, `same` is 1 or 2, and `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` in `ar`. Additionally, `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1.**
