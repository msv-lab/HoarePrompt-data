The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` is 0.**
