Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings with at least one element, `x` is 2, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different string length compared to their original string length, and `rev_val` must have at least 2 elements, `val_in` is the integer value of the element at index 2 in `rev_val`, `rev_res` is a string containing the elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same string length as their original string length, concatenated together. If `x` is even, `rev_res` includes the string representation of `val_in` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The value of `val_in` is assigned the integer value of the element at index 2 in `rev_val`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition for `rev_res` is still valid, and if `x` is even, `rev_res` will include the string representation of `val_in` appended to it.
