Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factor` is the next element from `rest`**. 

The value of `prime_to_i` has been reset to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.
