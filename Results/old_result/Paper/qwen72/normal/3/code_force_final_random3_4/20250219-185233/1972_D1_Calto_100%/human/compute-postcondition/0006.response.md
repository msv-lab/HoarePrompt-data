Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`.
- Given `i` is 2, the expression `i * i - i` evaluates to `2 * 2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`.
- Therefore, `x` becomes `n - 2`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `i`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `cnt` is calculated as `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1`, `i` is 2, and `y` is 1, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, all remain valid.
