Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least two integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the second integer in the list `a`. The initial state information that `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and `i` is the second integer in this list remains unchanged. The updated value of `cntl[i]` is now 1 more than its previous value.
