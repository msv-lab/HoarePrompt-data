Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `eta_ln`, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` > 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` in the range 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of all `q[eta[k]]` for `k` in the range 0 to `j-1`)` for all `j` in the range 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- The list `w` remains unchanged.
- The list `q` is still a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, but each `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`.
- The value of `j` is equal to `eta_ln`, which is the length of the list `eta`.
- The list `eta` contains all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`.
- The value of `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.
- The value of `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` in the range 0 to `eta_ln - 1`.
- The value of `res` is the sum of two parts:
  - The first part is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for all `j` in the range 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.
  - The second part is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of all `q[eta[k]]` for `k` in the range 0 to `j-1`)` for all `j` in the range 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.
