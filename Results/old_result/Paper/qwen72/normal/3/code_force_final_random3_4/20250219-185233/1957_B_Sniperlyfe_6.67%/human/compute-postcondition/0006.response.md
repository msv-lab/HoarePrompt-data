Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is now \(k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\), `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element (`nums[0]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and the second element (`nums[1]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), all other elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `i` remains 1.
- `k` is updated to \(k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\).
- `nums` remains a list of length `n` with the first element (`nums[0]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and the second element (`nums[1]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), and all other elements initialized to 0.
