Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`, `j` is `start_index + i`, `arr[j]` is equal to `i` for all `j` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i` inclusive, and `res` has a new tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` appended to it.**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains greater than 0, and `start_index` is still a valid index for the array `arr`. The loop variable `j` will have reached the value `start_index + i` by the end of the loop. Additionally, all elements in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` inclusive will have been set to the value `i`. The list `res` will have a new tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` appended to it, reflecting the range of indices that were updated in the array `arr`. The other variables mentioned in the initial state, such as `is_already_stairs`, will remain unchanged.
