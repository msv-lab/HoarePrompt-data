#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually take parameters to process the input. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`, ..., `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 1` if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
    #   - The exact values of `a` depend on the original values, but they will be the cumulative sums of the original list up to `n`.
    #
    #Output:
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n`, `a` is the cumulative sum of its original values, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if the new `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if the new `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`, ..., `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 1` if the new `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 2, `q` is 0. The program prints 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise it prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes an array `c` and a list of queries. It first reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input, where `n` is the length of the array `c` and `q` is the number of queries. It then reads the array `c` from the input and initializes an auxiliary array `b`. The function computes the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in `a`. For each query, represented by a tuple `(x, y)`, the function checks if the sum of the subarray `c[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum in the auxiliary array `b` or if `x == y`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all queries, the function terminates.
