Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique integer in `pl` by 3, for all integers in `pl` whose count is greater than or equal to 3.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all iterations, the variable `shapes` will contain the total number of times each unique integer in the list `pl` can be divided by 3 (using integer division), but only for those integers that appear 3 or more times in the list `palka`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
