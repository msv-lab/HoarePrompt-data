Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 3, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1]) + abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_beauty` is updated by adding `abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])` to its current value.
- The value of `i` is 3, so `new_arr[i]` refers to `new_arr[3]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` refers to `new_arr[2]`.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `left`, `right`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged.
