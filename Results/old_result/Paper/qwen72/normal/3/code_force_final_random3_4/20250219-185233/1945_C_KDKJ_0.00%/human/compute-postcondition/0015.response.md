Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing `[0, 0]` and `[x, y]`, `s` is the second character of `a`. If `s` is '0', `x` (the second element of the last sublist in `S`) is incremented by 1, and `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y` (the last element of the last sublist in `S`) is incremented by 1, and `x` remains unchanged.**
