Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
