The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the array a, followed by n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. The next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the following q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
