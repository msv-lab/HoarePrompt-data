Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `k + Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int((n - Min * Max) / k), k), `number` is `Min`.**

The value of `number` is updated to be equal to `Min`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
