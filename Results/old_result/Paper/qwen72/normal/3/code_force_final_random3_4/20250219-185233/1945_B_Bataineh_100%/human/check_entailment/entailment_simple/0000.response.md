### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - The output is a single number for each test case, which is the expected format.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif-else` conditions to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - **Case 1: `m < a and m < b`**
     - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2. This is because the visibility period of each firework is `m + 1` minutes, and since `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, no two fireworks from the same installation can overlap.
   - **Case 2: `m < a and m > b`**
     - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // b`. This is because the visibility period of each firework is `m + 1` minutes, and since `m` is greater than `b`, multiple fireworks from the second installation can overlap.
   - **Case 3: `m < b and m > a`**
     - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // a`. This is because the visibility period of each firework is `m + 1` minutes, and since `m` is greater than `a`, multiple fireworks from the first installation can overlap.
   - **Case 4: `else` (i.e., `m >= a` and `m >= b` or `m == a` or `m == b` or `m > a` and `m > b` but not both `m < a` and `m < b` or `m < a` and `m > b` or `m < b` and `m > a` are true)**
     - In this case, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is because the visibility period of each firework is `m + 1` minutes, and since `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, multiple fireworks from both installations can overlap.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1, and `m` is very large. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // 1 + m // 1 = 2 + m + m = 2 + 2m`.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `6 7 4`, the program correctly outputs `2` because `m` is less than both `a` and `b`.
   - For the input `3 4 10`, the program correctly outputs `7` because `m` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and the maximum number of overlapping fireworks is `2 + 10 // 3 + 10 // 4 = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7`.
   - For the input `7 8 56`, the program correctly outputs `17` because `m` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and the maximum number of overlapping fireworks is `2 + 56 // 7 + 56 // 8 = 2 + 8 + 7 = 17`.
   - For the input `5 6 78123459896`, the program correctly outputs `28645268630` because `m` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and the maximum number of overlapping fireworks is `2 + 78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 = 2 + 15624691979 + 13020576649 = 28645268630`.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `4` because `m` is equal to both `a` and `b`, and the maximum number of overlapping fireworks is `2 + 1 // 1 + 1 // 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.
   - For the input `1 1 1000000000000000000`, the program correctly outputs `2000000000000000002` because `m` is equal to both `a` and `b`, and the maximum number of overlapping fireworks is `2 + 1000000000000000000 // 1 + 1000000000000000000 // 1 = 2 + 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 = 2000000000000000002`.
