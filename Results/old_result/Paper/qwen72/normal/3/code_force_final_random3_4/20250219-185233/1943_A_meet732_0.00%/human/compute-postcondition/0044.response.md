Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `n` is an input integer, `cntl[i]` is now 2.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `cntl[i]` was initially 1, after the increment, it becomes 2. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
