Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- The value of `res[c-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged, with `c` still being incremented by 1.
- The value of `l` remains unchanged.
- The condition for updating `ans` and `res[c-1]` is based on the assumption that `s[k]` is not 'L', as the code snippet provided only shows the update for the case where `s[k]` is not 'L'.
