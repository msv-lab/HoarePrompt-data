Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.***
