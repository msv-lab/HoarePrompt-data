Output State: **The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The list `trumps` is an empty list. The list `answers` now contains a single string which is the result of joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, and appending the `suit` to each element. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`, except for `suits[suit]` which is now `None`. The suit of the first card is not equal to the trump suit.**

Explanation:
- The code `suits[suit] = None` sets the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
