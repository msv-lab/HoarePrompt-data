Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is equal to `count`, `done` is set to True, and if `count` > 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is not equal to `count`, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count2`, `j`, and `count` remain unchanged, and `done` remains False.***
