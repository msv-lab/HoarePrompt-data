Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `done` is True if `count2` is greater than `count`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count2`, `j`, `count`, and `s[j]` remain unchanged, and `done` remains False.***
