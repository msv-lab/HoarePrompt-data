The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is the length of the `ratings` list and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list and must be greater than 2, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is 2, `i` is 2**
