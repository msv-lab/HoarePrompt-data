Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is 0, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and now contains each unique integer `a_i` from the list `a` as keys with their respective values being the count of how many times each integer appears in the list `a`, `i` is `N-1`, `N` is the size of the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        return i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is 0 or 1, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and now contains each unique integer `a_i` from the list `a` as keys with their respective values being the count of how many times each integer appears in the list `a`, `i` is 0, `N` is the size of the list `a`. `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is 0 or 1, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and now contains each unique integer `a_i` from the list `a` as keys with their respective values being the count of how many times each integer appears in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `N` is the size of the list `a` and `N` must be greater than 0, `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not 0. If `t` is 1 and `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is set to 1. If `t` is 0 or `cnt[i]` is greater than 1, `t` remains 0. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program returns 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is 0 or 1, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and now contains each unique integer `a_i` from the list `a` as keys with their respective values being the count of how many times each integer appears in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `N` is the size of the list `a` and `N` must be greater than 0, `t` is less than 2, and `cnt[i]` is not 0. If `t` is 2 or greater, or if `cnt[i]` is 0, the program returns the integer 2. Otherwise, `t` remains 0 or 1 and the program does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
