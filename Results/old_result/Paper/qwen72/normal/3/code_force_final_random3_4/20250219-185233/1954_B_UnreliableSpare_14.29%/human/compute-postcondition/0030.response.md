The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `cnt` was initially 2 if `arr[i]` was equal to `val`, and 0 otherwise, after the execution, `cnt` will be 3 if `arr[i]` was equal to `val`, and 1 otherwise. The value of `ans` remains the same, as it was the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`, which was 2 if `arr[i]` was equal to `val`, and 0 otherwise.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 2, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 3 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ans` is 2 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
