Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[2]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[2]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]`, `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`**

The code snippet `mid = l + (h - l) // 2` recalculates the value of `mid` based on the current values of `l` and `h`. The new value of `mid` is the integer division of the difference between `h` and `l`, added to `l`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
