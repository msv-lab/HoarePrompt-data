Reasoning:  
The program's goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program prints a specific pattern of points for each test case, but we need to verify if this pattern indeed maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - The Manhattan distances are \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\) and \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\) has size 2, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 2\).

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
     - \(|1-2| + |2-3| = 2\)
     - \(|2-2| + |3-3| = 0\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) has size 4, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).

3. **For \(n \geq 4\)**:
   - The program prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \(j\) ranging from 4 to \(n\).
   - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are always included, providing the distances 0 and 1.
   - The point \((2, 4)\) is included, which adds more distances:
     - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
     - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
     - \(|2-2| + |4-4| = 0\)
   - The points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) are all on the diagonal, and the distances between these points and the first three points are:
     - \(|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)\)
     - \(|1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1) - 1\)
     - \(|2-j| + |4-j| = 2(j-2)\)
   - The distances between the diagonal points themselves are:
     - \(|j_1 - j_2| + |j_1 - j_2| = 2|j_1 - j_2|\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will include all these distances, and the pattern ensures that the distances are distinct and cover a wide range.

However, the program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n \geq 4\). For example, for \(n = 4\), the program prints:
- \((1, 1)\)
- \((1, 2)\)
- \((2, 4)\)
- \((4, 4)\)

The distances are:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
- \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
- \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
- \(|4-4| + |4-4| = 0\)

The set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\) has size 5, which is not necessarily the maximum possible for \(n = 4\). A better arrangement could be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 4)\), \((4, 1)\), \((4, 4)\), which would yield \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}\) with size 6.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the optimal solution for \(n \geq 4\).

Correctness: **False**
