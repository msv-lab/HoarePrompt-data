Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`).
2. `n` is the input integer.
3. `arr` is the list of integers input by the user.
4. `mex` is a list of integers that has been fully iterated.
5. `i` is `n - 1`.
6. `itm` is the last element in `mex`.

### Print Statement:
```
print()
```

### Analysis:
- The `print()` statement is called without any arguments.
- When `print()` is called without any arguments, it prints a newline character, which is an empty line.

### Output:
Output: **(an empty line)**

This means that the print statement will simply print a blank line.
