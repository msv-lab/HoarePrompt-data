To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file.
- `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file.
- `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file.
- `s` is the third line of the input file.

### Conditions:
1. If `x < k - 1`:
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds.
   - If `a` is less than `x + 1`, the condition `a < x + 1` holds.
2. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`:
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part.
   - If `a` is less than `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.
3. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 2` and not equal to `k - 1`:
   - `i` is `x - k + 2`.
   - `z` is the result of the loop body being applied `x - k + 3` times.
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the program retains these conditions.
   - If `a` is less than `z`, the program also retains these conditions.

### Analysis:
- The `print('NO')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
- The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the content of the print statement itself. They only describe the state of the program and the values of the variables before the print statement is executed.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `s`.

Output: **NO**
