The only objects in the loop head are `factor` and `rest`. Therefore, we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `rest` iterable. If `rest` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rest` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element. For the loop to execute one more time, `rest` must still have at least one more element, and `factor` will be the next element in `rest`.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime_to_i * prime`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`**
