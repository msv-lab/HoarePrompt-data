Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing at least two elements, `mini` is the first element of `arr`, `item` is the second element of `arr`, and `res` is an input string. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is updated to the second element of `arr` and `item` remains the second element of `arr`. If `res` is not '>', the variables retain their initial values.***
