The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in the queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`m`), the cost to bribe each person (`a`), and the additional cost to bribe each person between positions (`b`). For each test case, it calculates the minimum total cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue and prints this cost. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes `t` (the number of test cases), `cases` (the same as `t`), and `c` (the index of the last test case processed, which is `cases - 1`). The variables `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best` are reset for each test case and are not retained after the function completes.
