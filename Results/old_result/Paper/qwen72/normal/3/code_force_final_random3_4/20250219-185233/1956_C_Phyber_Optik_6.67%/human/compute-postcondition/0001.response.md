The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need an initial value before the loop starts. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500**
