The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The function returns a string indicating the winner, which can be either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The return value is determined based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function always returns 'Alice'.
- **Case_2**: The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. The value of `A` is toggled (changed to its opposite) if `not_c` is True, and remains unchanged if `not_c` is False. `not_c` is True if no two consecutive elements in the set of elements from `arr` have a difference greater than 1, otherwise it is False.

Since Case_1 is always executed, Case_2 is not applicable. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to always return 'Alice'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and always returns the string 'Alice'.**
