Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the insertion and deletion operations as described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not maintain the correct state of the array `a` after each deletion, which is crucial for the problem's requirements. The problem states that after each deletion, the indices of all elements to the right of the deleted element should decrease by 1. However, the program does not update the array `a` to reflect this change, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
4 3 2
```

However, the program will output:
```
4 3 3
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the deletion of elements from `a` and the subsequent index adjustments. The correct approach would be to remove elements from `a` and adjust the indices of the remaining elements accordingly.
