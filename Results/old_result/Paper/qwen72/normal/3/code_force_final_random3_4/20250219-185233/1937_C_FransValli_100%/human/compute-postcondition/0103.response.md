The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

- `i` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, so it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `res`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[2]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. `res` is now the input value.**
