The value of `v` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is the integer value input by the user. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function definition `def func_1(t, test_cases):` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is an input integer. The variable `v` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros. The values of `t` and `test_cases` are not affected.**
