Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints a specific value based on the following logic: If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. If `n` is exactly a power of 2, it prints `2 ** n`. If `n` is not a power of 2, it prints `2 ** (floor(log2(n)))`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
