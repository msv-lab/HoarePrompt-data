### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vasya is in position `n` in the line and received the number `x` during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - We need to find all possible values of `k` such that Vasya's position and number fit the pattern.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern for the first `k` positions is `1, 2, 3, ..., k`.
   - The pattern for the next `k - 2` positions is `k - 1, k - 2, ..., 2`.
   - This pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - Vasya's position `n` and number `x` must fit into one of the repeating segments.
   - If `n` is within the first `k` positions, then `x` should be `n`.
   - If `n` is within the next `k - 2` positions, then `x` should be `k - (n - k + 1)`.
   - The position `n` can be expressed as `n = m * (2k - 2) + p` where `p` is the position within the current segment.

4. **Conditions for Valid `k`:**
   - For the first segment: `1 <= n <= k` and `x = n`.
   - For the second segment: `k + 1 <= n <= 2k - 2` and `x = k - (n - k + 1) = 2k - n - 1`.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses the function `func_1` to find all divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
   - It then checks if these divisors can form valid `k` values by ensuring `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

6. **Execution Summary:**
   - `func_1` correctly returns all divisors of `x` in descending order.
   - The main loop checks both `n + x - 2` and `n - x` for divisors and ensures that the derived `k` values are valid.

7. **Logical Flow:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors and checks the conditions for valid `k`.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates is appropriate.

8. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k = 1` is not valid.
   - It also handles the constraints `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints and the problem description. The execution summary confirms that `func_1` works as expected, and the main logic checks the conditions for valid `k` values.

### Correctness:
**True**
