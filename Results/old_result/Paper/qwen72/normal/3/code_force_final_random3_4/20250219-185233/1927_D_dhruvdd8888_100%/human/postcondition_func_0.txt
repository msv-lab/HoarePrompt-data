The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an input array. It reads an integer `N` representing the length of the array, followed by the array itself. It then reads a series of queries, each consisting of two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, the function determines and prints a pair of indices that represent the boundaries of a segment in the array where the segment starts and ends with the same number, and this segment is adjacent to the range `[l, r]`. If no such segment exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.
