Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in `qs`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variables `k` and `q` remain as input integers.
- The list `p` remains unchanged.
- The list `qs` is the same list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `res` now contains the results of the function `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in the list `qs`. Each result is appended to `res` in the order that the corresponding integer `n` appears in `qs`.
