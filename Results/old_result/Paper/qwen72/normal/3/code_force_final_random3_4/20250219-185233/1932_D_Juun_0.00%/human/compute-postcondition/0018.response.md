Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`, `trumps` and `answers` are not affected.**

Explanation:
- The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the string `card` into two variables: `rank` and `suit`.
- `rank` is assigned the first character of `card`.
- `suit` is assigned the second character of `card`.
- The values of `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.
- `trumps` and `answers` are not affected by this code snippet, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
