The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is greater than or equal to 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1 + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0)`, `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
