Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `ops` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive). `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `vx` is now a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive).
- `ops` is now an empty list.
- The values of `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
- The initial state conditions for `p1` and `p2` are still valid, but `vx` and `ops` have been updated.
