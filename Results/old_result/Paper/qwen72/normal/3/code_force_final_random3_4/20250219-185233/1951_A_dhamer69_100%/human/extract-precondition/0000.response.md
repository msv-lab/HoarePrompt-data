It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem statement is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, but the function definition you provided is simply `def func():`. I will assume the correct function definition is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` and provide the precondition based on the problem description.

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end, and they represent the range of folder names to be checked for generating files.**
