Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements.
   - `x` is the smallest element in `inp`.
   - `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` if it exists and is different from `x`. If `y` does not exist (i.e., all elements in `inp` are the same), then `y` is also the smallest element in `inp`.
   - `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `x` is the smallest element in the list `inp`.
   - `y` is the second smallest element in the list `inp` if it is different from `x`. If all elements are the same, `y` is also the smallest element.
   - `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.

4. **Determining the Value of `ans`**:
   - To determine `ans`, we need to count the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.
   - If `y` is the same as `x` (i.e., all elements in `inp` are the same), then `ans` will be 0 because no element can be greater than both `x` and `y`.
   - If `y` is different from `x`, then `ans` will be the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be the value of `ans`, which is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`, and `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` if it exists and is different from `x`, otherwise `y` is the smallest element in `inp`)**
