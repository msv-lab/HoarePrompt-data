Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - If `n` is 1, `done` remains False and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop.
   - Otherwise, `done` remains False.
   - The first character of `s` (`x`) is not equal to the last character of `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and values for various variables, but none of these conditions or values affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, or `done`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
