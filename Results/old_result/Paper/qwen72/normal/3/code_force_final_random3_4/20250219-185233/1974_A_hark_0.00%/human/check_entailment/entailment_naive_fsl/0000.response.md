Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens needed when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` incorrectly adjusts the value of `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and then adding `y * 4`. This calculation does not correctly account for the space occupied by the 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons.

For example, consider the input `x = 12` and `y = 4`:
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2` (since 2 screens are needed for 4 2x2 icons).
- `x = 12 - 2 * 15 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2`.

The value of `x` becomes negative, which is incorrect. The program then prints `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`, where `bxsfory1` is `0` because `x` is negative, resulting in `2` being printed, which is incorrect. The correct number of screens needed for this case is `2` (1 screen for 4 2x2 icons and 1 screen for 12 1x1 icons).

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
