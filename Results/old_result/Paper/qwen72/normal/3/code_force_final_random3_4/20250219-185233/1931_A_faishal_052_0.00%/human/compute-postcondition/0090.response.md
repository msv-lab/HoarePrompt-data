Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `arr` is an empty list, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer.**

The code snippet `arr = []` reinitializes the list `arr` to an empty list, overriding its previous state. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `range`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.
