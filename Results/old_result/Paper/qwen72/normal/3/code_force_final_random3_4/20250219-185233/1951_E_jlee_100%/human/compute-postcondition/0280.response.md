Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count2` is 0. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is updated to 2 and `done` remains False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` equals `x`, `count` remains unchanged, `done` remains False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True.***
