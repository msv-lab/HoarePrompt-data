The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. The value of `factor * prime_to_i` is generated and returned, but the variables themselves are not modified. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the additional information that the value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 1, `_` is 2, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
