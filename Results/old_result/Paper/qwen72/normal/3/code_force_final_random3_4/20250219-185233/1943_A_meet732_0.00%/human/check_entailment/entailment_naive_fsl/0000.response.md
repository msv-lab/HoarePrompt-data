Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` contains no `0`s but does contain other numbers. According to the problem description, if the array `a` does not contain a `0`, the MEX of the resulting array `c` should be `0`. However, the program incorrectly prints `0` only if `0` is not present in the array, which is not the correct logic.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The expected output is `0` because the array `a` does not contain `0`, and the MEX of an array that does not contain `0` is `0`. However, the program will print `0` because it checks if `0` is not in `cntl`, which is incorrect.

The correct logic should be to find the smallest integer that is not present in the array `a` and ensure that Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
