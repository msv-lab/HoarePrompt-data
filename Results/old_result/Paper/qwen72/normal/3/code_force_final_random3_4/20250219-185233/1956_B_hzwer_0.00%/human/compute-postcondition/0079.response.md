The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. However, it is designed to process a predefined number of test cases, `t`, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and a list of test cases, `test_cases`, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` (representing the number of cards each player receives) and a list of integers (representing the integers on the cards in your hand). Each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list. The function returns the value of `dp[0][0]`, which represents the maximum number of pairs of cards that can be matched based on the rules provided, considering the initial state of the cards and the dynamic programming table `dp` that is updated according to the count of each card value in the cards.
