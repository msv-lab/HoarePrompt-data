Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed (though these variables are not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n - 1` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `possible` is `False`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'NO'. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement.

Output: **NO**
