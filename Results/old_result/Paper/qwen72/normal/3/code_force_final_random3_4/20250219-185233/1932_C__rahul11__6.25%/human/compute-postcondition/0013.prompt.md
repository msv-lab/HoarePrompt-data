Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `arr` is a list of integers read from a new input, `s` is a list of characters from a new input string, `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    ans *= i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `arr` is a list of integers read from a new input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is a list of characters from a new input string, `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `arr`, `i` is the first element in `arr`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `arr` is a list of integers read from a new input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is a list of characters from a new input string, `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `ans` is now equal to the product of the first and second elements of `arr`, `i` is the second element in `arr`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `arr` is a list of integers read from a new input that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is a list of characters from a new input string, `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `ans` is now equal to the product of the first, second, and third elements of `arr`, `i` is the third element in `arr`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
