You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is the number of iterations specified by the input, `n` and `m` are the last input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of two, `l` is "0", `p` is 1, `q` is 1, and `f` is 0. If `k` is odd, no additional changes are made. If `k` is even and not a power of two, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), and `f` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads a number of iterations from the user, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of two, it prints `k`. If `k` is odd, it prints `1`. If `k` is even and not a power of two, it performs a series of operations to reduce `k` to a smaller value and prints the final result. The function affects the state of the program by modifying local variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `f` during its execution, but these changes do not persist outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two sequences \( a \) and \( b \) defined by \( a_n = n \oplus x \) and \( b_n = n \oplus y \) respectively.
   - The task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of these sequences.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The sequences \( a \) and \( b \) are generated by XORing the index \( n \) with constants \( x \) and \( y \).
   - The difference between the sequences \( a \) and \( b \) is essentially \( n \oplus x \) and \( n \oplus y \). The key observation is that \( a_n = b_n \) if and only if \( n \oplus x = n \oplus y \), which simplifies to \( x = y \). Since \( x \neq y \), \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) will never be equal for any \( n \).
   - However, we need to find the longest common subsegment, which means we need to find the longest sequence of \( n \) values such that \( a_{i+k} = b_{j+k} \) for all \( k \) in the range \( [0, m-1] \).

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The length of the longest common subsegment is determined by the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the absolute difference \( k = |x - y| \).
   - This is because the XOR operation with a power of 2 will cycle through a sequence of values that repeats every \( 2^p \) where \( p \) is the position of the highest set bit in \( k \).

4. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values \( x \) and \( y \).
   - It calculates \( k = |x - y| \).
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2 (i.e., \( k \) is a number of the form \( 2^p \)), it prints \( k \).
   - If \( k \) is odd, it prints 1, because the longest common subsegment for odd \( k \) is always 1.
   - If \( k \) is even, it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) and subtracts it from \( k \). It then repeats this process until \( f \) (the remaining value) becomes a power of 2. The final value of \( f \) is the length of the longest common subsegment.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the cases where \( k \) is a power of 2, odd, or even.
   - The logic for finding the highest power of 2 and subtracting it is correct and efficiently reduces \( k \) to the desired form.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment for the given sequences \( a \) and \( b \). It handles all the edge cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.
