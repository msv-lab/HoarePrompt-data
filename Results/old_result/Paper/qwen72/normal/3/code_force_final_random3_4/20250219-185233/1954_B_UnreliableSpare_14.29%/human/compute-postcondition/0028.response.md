Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the minimum of Decimal('Infinity') and `cnt`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.***
