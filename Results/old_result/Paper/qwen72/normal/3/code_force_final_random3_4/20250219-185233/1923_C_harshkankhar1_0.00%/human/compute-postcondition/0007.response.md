Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated based on the condition `a[2] > 1`. If `a[2]` is greater than 1, `x` becomes 1; otherwise, `x` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `b[1]` is still `b[0] + x`, where `x` is the new value determined by the condition.
