Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers where each integer is the result of converting the corresponding string from the initial `arr` list to an integer, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`. `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**

The code snippet converts the first `x` elements of the `arr` list from strings to integers. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
