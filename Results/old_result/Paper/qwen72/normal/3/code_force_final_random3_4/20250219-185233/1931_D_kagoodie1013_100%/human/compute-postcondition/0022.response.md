Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have `n` elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements in `arr` that have the same residues when divided by `x` and `y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple of residues `(num % x, num % y)` and the value is the count of how many times this pair of residues appears in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each element `num` in the list `arr`.
- For each `num`, it calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`.
- It then checks how many times the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` has appeared in `residue_map` and adds this count to `count`.
- Finally, it updates the `residue_map` to increment the count of the current tuple `(num % x, num % y)`.

After all iterations:
- `count` will be the total number of pairs of elements in `arr` that have the same residues when divided by `x` and `y`.
- `residue_map` will contain the residues of all elements in `arr` as keys, and the values will be the counts of how many times each residue pair appears in `arr`.
