Output State: **`minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `minn`, and possibly `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 2.** 

The value of `minn` (which can be 0, 1, or 2) is appended to the list `mex`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `maxx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
