To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `not_mid`.

### Initial State:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`.
- `i` is `mid - 1`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` in the loop head will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `not_mid` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
