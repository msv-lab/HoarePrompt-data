Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `k` has completed its iterations and is now 3, and the `range` variable remains 3 as it is not modified within the loop. The loop has printed the characters corresponding to the first three elements of the `arr` list, each converted to a character using the `chr` function and adding 96 to the value.
