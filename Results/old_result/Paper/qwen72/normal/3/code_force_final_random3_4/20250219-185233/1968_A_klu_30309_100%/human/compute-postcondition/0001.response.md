The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element, and `x` must be the first element in the list `test_cases`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000.
- `results` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure `test_cases` has at least one element, and `x` is the first element in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
