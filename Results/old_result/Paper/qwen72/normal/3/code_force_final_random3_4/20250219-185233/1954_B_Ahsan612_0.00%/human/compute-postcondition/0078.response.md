Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The input value `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar` that was processed.
   - `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.
   - `minn` is not equal to infinity.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(minn)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `minn` is the result of a comparison between the previous value of `minn` and the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num` (denoted by `same`).
   - Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it must have a finite value.
   - The value of `minn` will be the smallest count of consecutive elements found in the list `ar` that are equal to `num`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(minn)` statement will print the minimum value of `same` that has been encountered during the processing of the list `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to num in the list ar)**
