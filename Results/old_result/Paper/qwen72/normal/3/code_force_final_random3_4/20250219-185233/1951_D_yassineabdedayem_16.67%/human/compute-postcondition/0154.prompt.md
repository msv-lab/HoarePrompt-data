Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met), `k` is either 0 or a positive integer, `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration, `i` is the last element in `tab` if `k` is 0, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`rep` is 60 or the loop condition (`n != 0 and k > 0 and n >= k`) is no longer satisfied, `n` and `k` are the final values after all iterations of the loop, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by the number of loop iterations, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the numbers appended during each iteration, `i` is `None` (since `k` is 0 or the loop condition is no longer satisfied), `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop. If `k` is 0, `i` is the last element of `tab` (or `None` if `tab` is empty), and `Min` and `Max` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is not 0, and `n` and `k` are the final values after all iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`rep` is 60 or less, `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `t` is 0 or a positive integer, `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration. If `k` is 0, `i` is the last element in `tab`, and `tab` has been fully iterated. If `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `None`. In both cases, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
