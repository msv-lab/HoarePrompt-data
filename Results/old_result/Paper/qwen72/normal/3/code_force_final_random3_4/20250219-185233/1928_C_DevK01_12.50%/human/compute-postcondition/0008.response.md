Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the value 1.**

The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `M`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
