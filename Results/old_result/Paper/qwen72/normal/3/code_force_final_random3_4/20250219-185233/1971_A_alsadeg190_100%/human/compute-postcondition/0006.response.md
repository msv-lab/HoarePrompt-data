Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an input integer such that 1 <= x <= 9.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.
- `i` is 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement will output the values of `y` and `x` in the order they are specified. Since `y` and `x` are input integers and `x` is known to be greater than or equal to `y`, the exact values of `y` and `x` are not specified, but we know the relationship between them.

Output: **y, x (where y is an input integer and x is an input integer such that 1 <= x <= 9 and x >= y)**
