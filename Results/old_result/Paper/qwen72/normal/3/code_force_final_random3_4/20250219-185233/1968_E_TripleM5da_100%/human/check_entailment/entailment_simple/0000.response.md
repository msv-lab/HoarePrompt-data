### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the size of the grid.

2. **Output Generation**:
   - The function prints the coordinates of the cells that are chosen to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - For each test case, it starts by printing the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - Then, for the remaining cells, it prints the coordinates `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n`.

3. **Analysis of the Output**:
   - The first two cells are always `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. This ensures that the Manhattan distance between these two cells is 1, which is a valid and necessary distance to include in \(\mathcal{H}\).
   - For the remaining cells, the function prints `(i, i)` for `i` from 3 to `n`. This means that the remaining cells are all on the diagonal of the grid starting from `(3, 3)` to `(n, n)`.
   - The Manhattan distance between any two cells on the diagonal is \(|i - j| + |i - j| = 2|i - j|\). This ensures that the distances between these cells are all even and distinct for different values of `i` and `j`.

4. **Maximizing the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\)**:
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will include the distance 1 (from `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)`).
   - It will also include the distances \(2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2(n-2)\) from the diagonal cells.
   - The total number of distinct distances is \(1 + (n-2) = n-1\), which is the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for a grid of size \(n \times n\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 2\), the function correctly prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\) with size 2.
   - For \(n = 3\), the function prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(3, 3)`, which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 4\}\) with size 4.
   - For larger values of \(n\), the function continues to print the required coordinates, ensuring that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates the coordinates for each test case to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, the program is correct.
