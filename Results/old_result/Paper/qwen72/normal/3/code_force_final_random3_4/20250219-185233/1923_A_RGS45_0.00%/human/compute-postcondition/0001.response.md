The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts, as it will be assigned by the `range(t)` function during each iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop**
