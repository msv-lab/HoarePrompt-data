Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`; otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of the first element in the list `nums` to the variable `num`.
- Since `i` is 0, `num` is assigned the value of `nums[0]`.
- The initial state already specifies that `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, so this assignment does not change the value of `num`.
- The other variables (`N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `arr`, and `nums`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `arr` being an empty list or containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)` is still valid based on the initial state.
- The list `nums` is still the list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.
