You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) for a beautiful array of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):

    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val` before encountering a different element, or `n` if all elements are equal to `val`. `ans` is the minimum value between Decimal('Infinity') and the length of the longest prefix of `arr` where all elements are equal to `val` before encountering a different element. If all elements in `arr` are equal to `val`, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: Output:
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value between the previous ans and cnt, and cnt is the number of consecutive elements from the start of arr that are equal to val)
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val` before encountering a different element, or `n` if all elements are equal to `val`, and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` is True, `cnt` is `n` because all elements in `arr` are equal to `val`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to the first element, and prints this minimum length. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is not entirely composed of the same elements but still meets the criteria of being beautiful. The logic in the program only checks if all elements are the same and then tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program will output `1`, which is correct. However, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 2 1
```
The program will output `1`, but the correct output should be `2`. The array `[1, 2, 2, 1]` is beautiful, and to make it non-beautiful, you need to remove at least two elements (e.g., removing the first and last elements results in `[2, 2]`, which is still beautiful, so you need to remove one more element to make it non-beautiful).

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
