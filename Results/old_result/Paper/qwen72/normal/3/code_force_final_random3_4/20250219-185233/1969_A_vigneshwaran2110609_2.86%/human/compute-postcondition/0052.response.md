The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `2`. The initial state describes the variables `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, and `flag`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the code snippet is solely determined by the value `2` that is explicitly printed.

Output: **2**
