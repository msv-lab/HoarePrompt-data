Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take a string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000. `s` is now a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark.**
