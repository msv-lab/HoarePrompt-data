Output State: **`vis` is a list where the element at index `ps - 1` is 1, and all other elements remain 0. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `n` is unchanged. `k` is unchanged. `pres` is 0. `preb` is `pathb[0] * k + pathb[1] + pathb[2]`. `resb` is `max(0, pathb[0] * k, pathb[0] * k + pathb[1] * (k - 1))`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. `ress` is 0. `i` is 2. `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `ps - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again. `ps` is now the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `preb` is updated by adding `pathb[2]` to it.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
