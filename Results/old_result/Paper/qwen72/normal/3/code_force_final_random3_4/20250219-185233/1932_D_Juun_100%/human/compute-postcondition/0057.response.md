Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is an empty list, meaning all the cards with the same suit as the `trump` have been popped out. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit. If `trumps` becomes empty before all non-trump cards are processed, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and return, leaving some non-trump cards unpaired.**
