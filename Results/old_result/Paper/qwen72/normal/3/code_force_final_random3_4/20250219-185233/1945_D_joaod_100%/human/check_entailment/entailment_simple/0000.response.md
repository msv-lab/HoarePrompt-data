### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `na_frente` and the maximum allowable final position `pos_final`.
   - It then reads the two lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, which represent the costs for Kirill to bribe the i-th person and the additional costs for each person between positions j and i, respectively.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each. This is necessary because the problem description uses 1-based indexing, while Python lists use 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization**:
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the total cost of bribes.
   - `best` is initialized to a very large number (`sys.float_info.max`), which will store the minimum cost to achieve the desired position.

4. **Loop Through the Queue**:
   - The program iterates from `na_frente` down to 0. This is correct because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward by bribing people.
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the range of the desired final position (`v <= pos_final`), it checks if the current total cost plus the cost to bribe the person at position `v` is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. This is correct because Kirill will always choose the cheaper option to minimize his total cost.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all positions, the program prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Issues:
- **Logic for Updating `best`**:
  - The condition `if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is correct for updating the best cost.
  - However, the logic for adding the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` is not entirely correct. The program should only add the cost to `total` if Kirill actually decides to bribe the person at position `v` to move to a position `j` where `j < v`. The current logic adds the cost unconditionally, which may lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Logic:
- The program should only add the cost to `total` if Kirill decides to bribe the person at position `v` to move to a position `j` where `j < v`. This means the cost should be added only when `v` is within the range of the desired final position and the cost to move to position `v` is considered.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program has a logical issue in how it accumulates the total cost. It adds the cost unconditionally, which may lead to incorrect results.

### Suggested Fix:
- The program should only add the cost to `total` when Kirill actually decides to bribe the person at position `v` to move to a position `j` where `j < v`. This can be achieved by moving the cost addition inside the condition where `v` is within the range of the desired final position.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import sys

def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        best = sys.float_info.max
        
        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                total += min(custo_pra_trocar_a[v], custo_pra_passar_b[v])
            else:
                total += min(custo_pra_trocar_a[v], custo_pra_passar_b[v])
        
        print(best)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Final Correctness:
- **False**: The original program has a logical issue that needs to be fixed as described above.
