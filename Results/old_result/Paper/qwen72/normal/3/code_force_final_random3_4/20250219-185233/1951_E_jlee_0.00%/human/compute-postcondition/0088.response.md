The provided code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `i` is 0.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` remains False. Otherwise, `count` and `done` retain their original values.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
