Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1 + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0)`, `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 6`, `y` is 9, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

The value of `y` is updated to 9, which is the result of `i * i` where `i` is 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
