The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop control variable `_` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`_` is the loop control variable, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that equals `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
