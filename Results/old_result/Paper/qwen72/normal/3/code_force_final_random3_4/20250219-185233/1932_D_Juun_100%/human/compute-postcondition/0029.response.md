Output State: **The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The variable `rank` is assigned the first character of `card`, and the variable `suit` is assigned the second character of `card`. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`, except for the key `suit` which is now set to `None`. The list `trumps` remains unchanged. The list `answers` is now either empty or contains a single string which is the result of joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, and appending `suit` to each element. The key `previous_suit` in the dictionary `suits` is either `None` or set to `previous_rank`. The list `input().split()` must have at least one more element, and `card` is the next element in this list.**
