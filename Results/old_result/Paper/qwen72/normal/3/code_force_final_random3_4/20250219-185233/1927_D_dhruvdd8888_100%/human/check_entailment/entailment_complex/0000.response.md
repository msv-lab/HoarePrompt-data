### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, but it should take parameters for the number of test cases and the test cases themselves. This is a significant issue because the function needs to handle multiple test cases as described in the problem.
   - The function reads input directly from `sys.stdin`, which is fine for a single test case but does not handle multiple test cases as required.

2. **Array Segmentation:**
   - The function attempts to segment the array `nums` into contiguous segments of the same number. This is done by appending tuples to `arr` that represent the start and end indices of each segment along with the number itself.
   - The loop that creates `arr` is mostly correct, but it appends an extra `-1` to `nums` which is not necessary for the problem and can lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The function processes each query by finding the segment that starts or ends within the query range `[l, r]` using `bisect_left`.
   - The conditions for determining the indices `i` and `j` are not correctly implemented. The function should check if there are any two indices within the range `[l, r]` where the elements are different, but the current logic is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results of the queries, but the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` is incorrect, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
- The function does not handle multiple test cases.
- The segmentation logic is unnecessary and complicates the solution.
- The query processing logic is incorrect and does not correctly identify pairs of different elements within the specified range.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function that should work as intended:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        nums = test_cases[_][1]
        queries = test_cases[_][2]
        
        for l, r in queries:
            found = False
            for i in range(l-1, r):
                for j in range(i+1, r):
                    if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                        print(i+1, j+1)
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                print(-1, -1)

# Example usage:
tc = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(tc):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = int(input())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(q)]
    test_cases.append((n, nums, queries))

func_1(tc, test_cases)
```

This implementation correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each query to find a pair of different elements within the specified range. If no such pair exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
