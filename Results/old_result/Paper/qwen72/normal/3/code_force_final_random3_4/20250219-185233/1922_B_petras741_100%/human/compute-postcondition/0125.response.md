Output State: **`j` is `n`, `n` remains unchanged, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is equal to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.** 

The value of `res` is calculated using the formula `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`, where `q[eta[0]]` is the value of the first element in the list `eta` which is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
