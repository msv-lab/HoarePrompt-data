Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**

The value of `A` is recalculated and remains the same as `int(m / a) + 1`. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `B` are not affected.
