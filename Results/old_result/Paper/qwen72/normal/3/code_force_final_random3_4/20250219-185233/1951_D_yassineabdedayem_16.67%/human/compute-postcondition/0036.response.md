Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it twice, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The values of `Min` and `Max` are still the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k` respectively, but `n` has been updated.
- The conditions for updating `number` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as described in the initial state.
