The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function. The other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. The list `answers` is also not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list**
