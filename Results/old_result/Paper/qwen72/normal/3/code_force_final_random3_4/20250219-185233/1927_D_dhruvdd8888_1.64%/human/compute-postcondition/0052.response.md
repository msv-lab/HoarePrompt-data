Let's break down the precondition and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Precondition Analysis:
1. **Input Integer for the Loop**: The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0.
2. **Variables `l` and `r`**: These are integers provided by the user.
3. **Condition for `tc`**: If `tc` is greater than 5, the loop continues to the next iteration.
4. **Condition for `ppp`**: If `ppp` is equal to 23, the postcondition remains unchanged.
5. **Variables `s` and `e`**: These are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
6. **Variable `eli`**: This is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. **Conditions for `s` and `e`**: `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Input Integer for the Loop**: This condition is not directly relevant to the `print` statement, but it ensures that the loop can run.
2. **Variables `l` and `r`**: These are provided by the user, but they do not affect the `print` statement.
3. **Condition for `tc`**: This condition is part of a loop control, but it does not affect the `print` statement.
4. **Condition for `ppp`**: This condition is also part of a loop control and does not affect the `print` statement.
5. **Variables `s` and `e`**: These are assigned based on the tuple in the list `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`. However, they are not used in the `print` statement.
6. **Variable `eli`**: This is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. Again, this does not affect the `print` statement.
7. **Conditions for `s` and `e`**: These conditions are satisfied by the assignment of `s` and `e`, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement is simply printing the values `-1` and `-1`. The precondition and the variables mentioned do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **-1, -1**
