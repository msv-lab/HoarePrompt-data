Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `k` is even.
   - `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in reverse order.
   - `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*answer)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `answer` list is defined as containing the integers from 1 to `n` in reverse order. This means that if `n` is 5, `answer` will be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
   - The `print(*answer)` statement will unpack the list `answer` and print its elements separated by spaces.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `answer` contains the integers from `n` to 1 in reverse order, the output will be the sequence of integers from `n` to 1, each separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **n (n-1) (n-2) ... 2 1 (where n is the value of n)**
