Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0, which was previously not specified. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
