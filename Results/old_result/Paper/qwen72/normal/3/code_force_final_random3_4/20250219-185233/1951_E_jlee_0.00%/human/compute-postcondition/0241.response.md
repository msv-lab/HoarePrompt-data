Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 2, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is 0 or 1. If `count` > 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` ≤ 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count` was initially 1, `done` remains False. Otherwise, if `count` ≤ 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `count2` is 0.***
