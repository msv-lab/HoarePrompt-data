The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range function will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 1 as defined by the range function.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1**
