Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, and `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. Regardless of whether the `count` is 2 or not, and regardless of the character following the first '1' in `a`, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
