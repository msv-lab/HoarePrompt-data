Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.** 

The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. If all elements in `a` are equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is `n` and `ans` remains `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `n` and this count.
