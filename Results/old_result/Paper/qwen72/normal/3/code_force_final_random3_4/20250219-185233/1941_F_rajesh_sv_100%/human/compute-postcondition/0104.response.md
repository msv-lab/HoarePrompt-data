Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[2]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[2]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is `mid`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`.**

Explanation:
- `h` is updated to be equal to `mid`.
- The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, `mid`, `ans`, and `f` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `h` must be greater than `l` is no longer explicitly mentioned, but it is still valid if `mid` was initially greater than `l`.
