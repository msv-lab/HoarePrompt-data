Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is the last element in the `nums` list (which is `-1`), and `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same number in the `nums` list, along with the number itself. The variable `s` is the index of the last segment's start position.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = N`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `N`.
- `num` is updated to `nums[i]` at each iteration, so after the last iteration, `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1` (since `-1` is appended to the end of `nums`).
- The list `arr` will contain tuples for each contiguous segment of the same number in the `nums` list. Each tuple `(start, end, value)` represents a segment starting at `start` and ending just before `end`, with `value` being the number in that segment.
- `s` is the index of the start of the last segment of the same number. If the last segment is a single number (e.g., the last number in the list is different from the one before it), `s` will be the index of that number. If the last segment is a continuation of the previous segment, `s` will be the start index of that segment.
