Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers connected to the key, `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, and `leaves` is a deque containing all the integers from 1 to `n` that have exactly one connection in `nodes`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `leaves` deque will contain all the nodes (integers from 1 to `n`) that have exactly one connection in the `nodes` defaultdict. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `nodes`, `edges`, `start`, and `empty`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
