Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1), `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 1`, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, and the integer `j + 1` does not appear in the list `cards`.**
