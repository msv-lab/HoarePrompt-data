Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 * n` and `r` is `n`. Otherwise, `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, and `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500.
- The variable `n` remains greater than 0.
- The loop variable `i` will have completed all iterations and will be equal to `n`.
- The variable `sum` will be the total sum of the values added during the loop. If the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true for all `i` from 1 to `n`, then `sum` will be `n * (n + 1) // 2 * n`. Otherwise, `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition is true, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition is false.
- The variable `r` will be the largest value of `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true. If the condition was never true, `r` will remain 0.
