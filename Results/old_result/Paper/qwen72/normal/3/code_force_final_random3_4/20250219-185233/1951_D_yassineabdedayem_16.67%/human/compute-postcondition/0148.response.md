The only objects in the loop head are the list `tab` and the variable `i`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in `tab`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element in `tab`.

State: **`rep` is 60 or less, `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`, `k` is 0, `t` is 0 or a positive integer, `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `tab`, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed**
