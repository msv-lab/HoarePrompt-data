Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be checked for generating files; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 but now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, the program performs the actions specified in the if part. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, no changes are made. If `count_1` is even, and if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a new input string. If `n` == 2, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `n` != 2 and `s` == '00', the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `n` != 2 and `count_1` (the number of '1' characters in `s`) is odd, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `n` != 2 and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string. If `n` == 2, the program executes the if part. If `n` != 2 and `count_1` (the number of '1' characters in `s`) is odd, or if `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, the program also executes the if part. In all other cases, the program executes the else part, but the state of the variables remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
