Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `pans` must have at least 3 elements.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
- If the user input is `'>`', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `mak`:**
   - If the user input is `'>`', then `mak` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Determine the indices used in the `print` statement:**
   - `pans[mak]` will be `pans[1]` if `mak` is 1, or `pans[0]` if `mak` is 0.
   - `pans[i]` will be `pans[2]` because `i` is 2.

3. **Construct the output:**
   - The `print` statement will print a string starting with `?` followed by four elements from the `pans` list.
   - The first two elements will be `pans[mak]` repeated.
   - The last two elements will be `pans[i]` repeated, which is `pans[2]`.

### Possible Outputs:
- If the user input is `'>`', then `mak` is 1, and the output will be:
  - `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2]`
- If the user input is not `'>`', then `mak` is 0, and the output will be:
  - `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2]`

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[2]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these elements.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where `mak` is 1 if the user input is `'>`', otherwise `mak` is 0)**
