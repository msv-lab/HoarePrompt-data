Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), and `n` is greater than 1 and not equal to 2. `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- `winNext` is assigned the result of the function `func_2` called with the arguments `a[1:]` (a slice of `a` starting from the second element to the end) and `n - 1` (one less than the current value of `n`).
- The precondition that `n` is greater than 1 and not equal to 2 still holds true.
