The value of `v1` is removed from the set `vx`. The set `vx` initially contains integers from 1 to `int(input())`, which is greater than 2. The list `ops` remains empty, and the value of `v2` is not affected by this code. The throwaway variable `_` is not affected.

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1`, `ops` is an empty list, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`.**
