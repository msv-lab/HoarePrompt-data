### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, but the function itself does not take any parameters. This is a problem because the function needs to handle the input for each test case.
   - The function should be defined as `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the length of the array, the array itself, and the list of queries.

2. **Array Segmentation:**
   - The program attempts to segment the array into contiguous segments of the same number. This is done using a loop that iterates through the array and appends tuples to `arr` when a different number is encountered.
   - The tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` represents the start and end indices of a segment, along with the number in that segment.
   - The program appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to ensure that the last segment is processed correctly.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that contains the start index `l` of the query.
   - The program then checks various conditions to determine if there is a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - The conditions are:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l` and the segment does not extend beyond `r`, it prints `s - 1` and `s`.
     - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
     - If the end of the segment is less than `N` or `l`, it prints `s` and `e + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the segment boundaries do not align with the query boundaries.
   - However, the logic for handling these edge cases is not entirely correct. For example, the condition `if s > l` and `if s == 1 or s > r` might not always work as intended.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices `i` and `j` for each query, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program has several issues:
  - The function `func_1` does not take the necessary parameters.
  - The logic for handling queries is not robust and might not correctly identify pairs of indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j`.
  - The use of `bisect_left` and the subsequent conditions are not correctly implemented to handle all possible query ranges.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should work as intended:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    for _ in range(t):
        N, nums, queries = test_cases[_]
        nums.append(-1)  # Append -1 to ensure the last segment is processed
        s = 0
        num = nums[0]
        arr = []
        
        for i in range(N + 1):
            if nums[i] != num:
                arr.append((s, i - 1, num))
                s = i
                num = nums[i]
        
        for l, r in queries:
            l -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            r -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            
            eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
            
            # Check if the segment containing l is different from the segment containing r
            if eli < len(arr) and arr[eli][0] <= l <= arr[eli][1]:
                if eli + 1 < len(arr) and arr[eli + 1][0] <= r <= arr[eli + 1][1]:
                    print(arr[eli][0] + 1, arr[eli + 1][0] + 1)
                else:
                    print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(-1, -1)

# Example usage:
tc = int(input())
test_cases = []

for _ in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    Q = int(input())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
    test_cases.append((N, nums, queries))

func_1(tc, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Function Definition:** The function `func_1` now takes `t` and `test_cases` as parameters.
- **Segmentation:** The array is segmented into contiguous segments of the same number, and each segment is stored as a tuple `(start, end, number)`.
- **Query Handling:** For each query, the program converts the indices to 0-based and uses `bisect_left` to find the segment containing `l`. It then checks if the segment containing `r` is different and prints the appropriate indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and efficiently.
