The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since no variables are passed to the function `func_2`, the loop's execution depends solely on the user input.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
