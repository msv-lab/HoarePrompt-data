The function `testcase` does not take any parameters. However, it is expected to read input in the following format: the first line contains two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, representing the edges of the tree. The last line contains a single integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
