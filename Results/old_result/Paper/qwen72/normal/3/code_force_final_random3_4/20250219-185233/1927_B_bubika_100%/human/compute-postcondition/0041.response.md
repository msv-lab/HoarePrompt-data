Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 2, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers input by the user, `r` is a string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the integers in `s`, in the order they appear in `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to an input integer greater than 2, but the other variables (`a`, `t`, `b`, `s`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
