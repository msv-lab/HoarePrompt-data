### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It initializes the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which is a reasonable approach to ensure that the vertices are partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the partition of the graph into cliques.
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then calls the function `make_array` for each clique, passing the appropriate range of indices and the clique number.

3. **Function `make_array`:**
   - The function `make_array` is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and their respective clique numbers.
   - It calculates the `small_element` and `big_element` based on the `left` and `right` indices.
   - It divides the range `[left, right]` into two parts, `mid` and `not_mid`, and assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.
   - The values assigned to `arr` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and the values assigned to `cliquess` are the clique numbers.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the values assigned to the vertices (`arr`), the number of cliques (`cliques`), and the partition of the graph into cliques (`cliquess`).

5. **Edge Addition Condition:**
   - The condition for adding an edge between vertices `i` and `j` is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - The program ensures that the values assigned to `arr` and `cliquess` are such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, and the edge condition is satisfied.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values within the given constraints.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly assigns distinct integers to the vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
- The edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied by the way the values are assigned in `make_array`.
- The program prints the correct output format for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
