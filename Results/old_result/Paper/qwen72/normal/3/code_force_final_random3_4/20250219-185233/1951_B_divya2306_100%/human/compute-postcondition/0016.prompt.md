Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The length of `ratings` is `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. Each rating in `ratings` is a distinct integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is an integer representing the length of the `ratings` list, and `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `wins` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    wins += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list and must be greater than 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is 1, `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list and must be greater than 1, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is 2, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list and must be greater than 2, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is 3, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
