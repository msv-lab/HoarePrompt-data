Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least 3 elements, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` and the value `2`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `r_x = -num % x` updates the value of `r_x` to be the result of `-num % x`.
- The value of `num` is the third element of `arr`.
- The value of `r_y` remains `num % y` as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- The value of `current_key` remains a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `r_x` is `-num % x`.

Thus, the output state reflects these changes and the unchanged values.
