Postcondition: ***`t` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input. If `n` == 1, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `a`. Otherwise, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.***
