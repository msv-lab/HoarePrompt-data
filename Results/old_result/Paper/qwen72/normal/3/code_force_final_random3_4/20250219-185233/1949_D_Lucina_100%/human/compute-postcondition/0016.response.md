The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 2**
