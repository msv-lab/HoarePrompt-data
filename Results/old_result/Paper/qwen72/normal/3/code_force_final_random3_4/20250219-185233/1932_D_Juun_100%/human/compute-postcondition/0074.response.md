Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes user inputs for the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit `trump_suit`, and a list of 2n unique card descriptions. It processes these inputs to pair cards, printing pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit and pairs of non-trump cards with trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-trump cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns. The function does not return any value and does not modify the original input parameters. **
