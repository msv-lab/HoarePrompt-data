Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, and `func_1()` has been called.** 

The code snippet `func_1()` simply calls the function `func_1()`. Since the function does not return any value or modify any variables in the given context, the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
