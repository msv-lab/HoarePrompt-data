Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, and the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.** 

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and the input list contains test cases with integers. After executing the code, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers, and the values of `t` and the constraints on the input list remain unchanged.
