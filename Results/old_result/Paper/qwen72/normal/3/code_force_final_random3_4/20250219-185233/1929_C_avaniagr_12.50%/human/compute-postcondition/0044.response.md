Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time, `z` is 2, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated by the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Initially, `z` is 1.
- The expression `z // (k - 1)` evaluates to 0 because `z` is 1 and `k` is at least 2, making `k - 1` at least 1.
- Therefore, `z` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but its specific value is not provided, so we only note that it has been incremented.
- The loop condition for `_` (i.e., `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time) remains valid.
