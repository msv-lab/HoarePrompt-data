To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three input integers.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is updated based on the condition `(b + c) % 3 != 0`.

2. **Condition and Update:**
   - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0` (i.e., the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3), then `k` is set to `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, if `(b + c) % 3 == 0` (i.e., the sum of `b` and `c` is divisible by 3), then `k` is set to `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k` after it has been updated based on the condition.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `k` will be:
- If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` will be `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.
- If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, then `k` will be `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the initial value of `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **k (where k is updated to `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, or `k + a + (b + c) // 3` if `(b + c) % 3 == 0`)**
