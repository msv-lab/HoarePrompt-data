Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `c` is `c + 1`. If the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is 'L', `ans` is `ans // arr[1] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is 1. Otherwise, if the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is not 'L', `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is `r - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is incremented by 1.
- The conditions for updating `ans`, `res[c]`, `l`, and `r` depend on the character at the 0th index of the string `s`.
- If the character at the 0th index of `s` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[1] % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is set to 1.
- If the character at the 0th index of `s` is not 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is decremented by 1.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
