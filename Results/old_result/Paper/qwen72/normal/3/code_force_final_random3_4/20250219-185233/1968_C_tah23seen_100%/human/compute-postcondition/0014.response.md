Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element of `ans` remains unchanged, initialized to `10 ** 9`. **
