The function `func_1` reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from user input. It then calculates and returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' character and the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s` (both 1-indexed), plus 2. The function does not use the parameters `t` and `test_cases` as described in the annotations.
