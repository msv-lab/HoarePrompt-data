Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 2, `j` is 2. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**
