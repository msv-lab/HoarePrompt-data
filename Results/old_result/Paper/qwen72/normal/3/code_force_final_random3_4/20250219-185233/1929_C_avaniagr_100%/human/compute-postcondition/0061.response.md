Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the fourth line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the fourth line of the input file, and `s` is the fourth line of the input file. If `a` >= `x` + 2, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` also remain unchanged.***
