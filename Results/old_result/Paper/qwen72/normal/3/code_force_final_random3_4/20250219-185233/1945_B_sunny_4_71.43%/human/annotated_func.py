#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters a, b, and m, where a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer t as the first parameter, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        
        print(A + B)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable that has been incremented by `t` times, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input for each test case, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1` for each test case, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1` for each test case, and the loop has printed `A + B` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from user input. It then calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m / b) + 1` for each test case, and prints the sum `A + B`. After all test cases are processed, the function does not return any value, but the user will have seen the sum `A + B` printed for each test case.
