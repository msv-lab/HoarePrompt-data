Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than `n`, `k` is the new value of `k` from input minus 1, `b` is the new value of `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is the new value of `s` from input minus 1, `bm` is equal to `a[b] * (k - 1)`, `sm` is equal to `a[s] * (k - 1)`, `sp` is equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is equal to `a[b]`, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
