To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `cnt`.

1. **Understanding the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over the values of the dictionary `cnt`. Each iteration assigns a new value from `cnt.values()` to the variable `x`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is `0 + x // 4` (where `x` is the first value in `cnt.values()`).
   - `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one value.
   - `x` is the first value in `cnt.values()`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The loop will execute again if there are more values in `cnt.values()`.
   - After the previous iteration, the next value in `cnt.values()` will be assigned to `x`.
   - The state of `ans` does not need to be adjusted because it is not part of the loop head.
   - The state of `cnt` must remain such that it has at least one more value for the loop to continue.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - `x` will now be the second value in `cnt.values()`.
   - `cnt` must have at least two values for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`ans` is `0 + x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `cnt` must have at least two values, `x` is the second value in `cnt.values()`**
