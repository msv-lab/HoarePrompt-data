Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `h` is '12', `m` is the minute part of the input string, `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'.**

The code assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `time` is now 'PM', while `t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` retain their initial values.
