Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements, and `v` has been appended to `nodes[u]` again.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 1, `i` is still 1, `u` and `v` are still the input integers they were before. `nodes[u]` already included `v` as one of its elements, and now `v` has been appended to `nodes[u]` again, meaning `v` appears twice in `nodes[u]`. `nodes[v]` still includes `u` as one of its elements.
