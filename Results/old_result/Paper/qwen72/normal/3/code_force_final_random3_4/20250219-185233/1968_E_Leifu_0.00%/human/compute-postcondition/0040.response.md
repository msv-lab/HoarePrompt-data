Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `j` is 5.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`**: The variable `j` is explicitly defined as 5 in the initial state.
2. **String Concatenation**: The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then with the string representation of `j` again.
3. **Output Calculation**: Since `j` is 5, the string representation of `j` is `'5'`. Therefore, the concatenation `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` results in `'5 5'`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'5 5'`.

Output: **5 5**
