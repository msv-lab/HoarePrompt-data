The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
- `i` is 2.
- If `x` is divisible by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, then `ans` is set to `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 3, `ans` is set to `x // 2` if `x` is divisible by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, otherwise `ans` remains 0**
