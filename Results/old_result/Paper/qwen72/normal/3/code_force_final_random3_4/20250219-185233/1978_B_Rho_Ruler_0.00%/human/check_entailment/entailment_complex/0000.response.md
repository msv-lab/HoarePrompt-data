Reasoning:  
The program provided is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling all n buns. However, the implementation has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Misuse**: The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` value. However, the binary search is not correctly implemented to solve this problem. The binary search is typically used to find a specific value or condition in a sorted list, but here, the condition `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` is not meaningful for determining the maximum profit.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` calculates the total profit for a given `k` and checks if this profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition is not relevant to finding the maximum profit. The function should instead return the profit itself, and the main loop should compare different profits to find the maximum.

3. **Output of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is used to store the optimal `k` value, but the program prints `ans` directly, which is not the profit. The profit should be calculated and printed based on the optimal `k`.

4. **Logical Error**: The program does not correctly handle the logic to determine the maximum profit. The binary search approach is not appropriate for this problem, and the condition in `func_1` does not help in finding the optimal `k`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
