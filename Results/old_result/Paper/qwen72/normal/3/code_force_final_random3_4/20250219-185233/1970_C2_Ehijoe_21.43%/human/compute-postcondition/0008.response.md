The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1, but now `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` (which is 1) is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements.**
