Postcondition: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, and `i` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 2 and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `num` is updated to the value at index `i` of `ar`, and `i` is incremented to 2.**
