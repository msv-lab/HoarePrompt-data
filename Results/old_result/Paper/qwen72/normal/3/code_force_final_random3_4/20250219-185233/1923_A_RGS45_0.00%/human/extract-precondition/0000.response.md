Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i = 0 indicates a free cell and a_i = 1 indicates a cell with a chip. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to reflect the input parameters correctly. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def min_operations(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing `n` and the list of integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`.
