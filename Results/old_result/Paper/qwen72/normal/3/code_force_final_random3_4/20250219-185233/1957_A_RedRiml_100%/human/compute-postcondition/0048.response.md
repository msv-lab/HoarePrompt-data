Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `shapes` is the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique integer in `palka` by 3, for all integers in `palka` whose count is greater than or equal to 3, and the current value of `d.get(i)` is 1.**
