Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0, `y` is the minimum value in the new `nums`.**

The value of `x` is set to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `x` was the maximum value in the new `nums`, but after the code execution, `x` is now 0. The value of `y` remains the minimum value in the new `nums`.
