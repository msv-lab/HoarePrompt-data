### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`. Each element `S[i]` contains the count of zeros and ones from the start of the string up to the `i-1`-th house.
   - This is done using a loop that iterates through the string `a` and updates the counts accordingly.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The program iterates through all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n`) to place the road.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the left side houses and if the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the right side houses.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum list `S` is correctly built. Each element `S[i]` contains the count of zeros and ones up to the `i-1`-th house.
  - This allows for efficient calculation of the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road for any position `i`.

- **Condition Checking:**
  - The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are used to check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
  - These conditions are mathematically correct and ensure that the road placement is fair according to the problem's requirements.

- **Optimal Position Selection:**
  - The program correctly updates the answer `ans` to the position `i` that is closest to the middle of the village while satisfying the conditions.
  - The use of `abs(n / 2 - i)` ensures that the position is as close to the middle as possible.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`).
  - The initial value of `ans` is set to `-1` to ensure that it is updated correctly during the iteration.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given problem description. It handles all the conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
