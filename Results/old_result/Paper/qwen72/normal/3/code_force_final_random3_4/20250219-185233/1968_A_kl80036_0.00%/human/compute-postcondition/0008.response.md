The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can refer to as `t` for simplicity. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `i` is 1
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0
- `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `t` must still be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.**
