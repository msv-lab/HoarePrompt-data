### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is activated.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The task is to determine the winner for each round, given the starting node.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function computes the distances from the starting node to all its descendant nodes, excluding the parent node.
     - If the starting node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is its parent), it returns a list containing the single element `0`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively computes the distances for each child node and adds `1` to each distance to account for the additional step from the starting node to the child.
     - The function returns a list of these distances.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner for the given starting node.
     - It reads `n` and `t` from the input, where `t` is always `1`.
     - It reads `n - 1` edges and constructs a bidirectional adjacency list `nodes`.
     - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque `leaves`.
     - It reads the starting node `start` and calls `func_1` to get the list of distances from the starting node to its descendants.
     - It checks if any of these distances is odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Tree Construction**:
     - The tree is correctly constructed using a bidirectional adjacency list.
     - Leaf nodes are correctly identified and stored in a deque.
   - **Distance Calculation**:
     - `func_1` correctly computes the distances from the starting node to its descendants.
     - The recursive approach ensures that all paths are considered.
   - **Winner Determination**:
     - The logic for determining the winner is correct. If there is at least one odd distance, Ron can always make a move to an odd-distance node, leaving Hermione with an even-distance node. Conversely, if all distances are even, Hermione will always have a move, and Ron will eventually be left with no valid move.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The function handles the case where the starting node is a leaf node correctly by returning a list containing `0`.
     - The function also handles the case where the tree is a single path (i.e., a linear tree) correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game for each round based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
