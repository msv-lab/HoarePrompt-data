Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 1, `nx` is a string containing the character at position `i` (which is 3) in `xx` and index `j - 1` (which is 0), and the character at position `i` in `xx` and index `j - 1` (which is 0) is not a question mark (`?`).**
