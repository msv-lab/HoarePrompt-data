Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle the case where there are multiple non-trump cards of the same suit that cannot be beaten by any other card of the same suit, but can be beaten by a trump card. Here is an example:

Input:
```
1
3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S
```

Expected Output:
```
3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S
```

However, the program will output:
```
3C 4C
6D 9S
IMPOSSIBLE
```

This is because the program only tries to beat non-trump cards with the next available trump card if there are no other cards of the same suit to beat it. In this case, the 6D is correctly beaten by the 9S, but the 3S is not beaten by the 7S, and the program incorrectly concludes that it is impossible to beat the 3S, even though there is a valid trump card (9S) that could have beaten it.
