Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` has a new element 'Draw' appended to it. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob'.**
