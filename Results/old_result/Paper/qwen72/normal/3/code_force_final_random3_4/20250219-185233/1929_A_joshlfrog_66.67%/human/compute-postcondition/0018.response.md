The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `l` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `l` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `l` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2. If `nums[2]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to `nums[2]`. If `nums[1]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to the value of `nums[1]`. If `nums[2]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.**
