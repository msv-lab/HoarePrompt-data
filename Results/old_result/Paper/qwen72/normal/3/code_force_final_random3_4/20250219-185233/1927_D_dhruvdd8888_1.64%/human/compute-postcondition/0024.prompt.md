Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is an integer read from the standard input, `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout, the input consists of multiple test cases with the same format and constraints, `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`; otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the second integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to the second element of `nums`; otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1, num)`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the third integer in the list `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is 2 and `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2, num)`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
