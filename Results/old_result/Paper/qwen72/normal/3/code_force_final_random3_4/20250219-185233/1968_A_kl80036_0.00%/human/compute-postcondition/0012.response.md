Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000, as it was initially.
- The variable `i` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed `t` iterations.
- The variable `x` will be the last input integer provided, which is greater than 0.
- The variable `y` will be the integer result of the last `x` divided by 2, as calculated in the loop.
