Output State: **The list `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n). `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and is initially empty.**
