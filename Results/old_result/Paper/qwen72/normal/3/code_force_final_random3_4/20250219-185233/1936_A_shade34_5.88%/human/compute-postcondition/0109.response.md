Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.** 

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of `i` or `n`, so the values of these variables remain unchanged. However, `i` was incremented by 1 in the adjusted state, making it 1. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1.
