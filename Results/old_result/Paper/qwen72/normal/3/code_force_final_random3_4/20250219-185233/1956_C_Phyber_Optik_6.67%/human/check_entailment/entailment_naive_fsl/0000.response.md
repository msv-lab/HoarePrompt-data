Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of operations and the sum is flawed. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using a loop that iterates from 1 to `n`, but the logic for adding to the sum is incorrect. The correct sum for an `n x n` matrix where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` should be `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`. However, the program's sum calculation is not consistent with this.

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program calculates the number of operations as `n + r`, where `r` is determined in a loop. This is not necessarily the correct number of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. The problem description guarantees that the maximum sum can be achieved with no more than `2n` operations, but the program does not ensure this.

3. **Operation Types**:
   - The program prints operations of type 1 and type 2, but the logic for determining which type of operation to use and how many times is not clear and does not align with the problem description. For example, the program always prints type 1 operations for the first `n` operations and type 2 operations for the remaining `r` operations, which is not necessarily the optimal way to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Permutation Assignment**:
   - The program always uses the permutation `range(1, n + 1)` for both row and column operations. While this is a valid permutation, it does not necessarily maximize the sum in all cases.

Example Case:
For `n = 2`, the correct output should be:
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
However, the program outputs:
```
6 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
The sum is incorrect, and the number of operations is not optimized. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
