Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the range is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `lex` is now less than or equal to -1, and `arr` is a list with three elements [1, 1, 26]. If `lex` was greater than 25 but less than 52, `lex` is now `lex - 26`, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 1, 26]. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is now `lex - 52`, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 26, 26].***
