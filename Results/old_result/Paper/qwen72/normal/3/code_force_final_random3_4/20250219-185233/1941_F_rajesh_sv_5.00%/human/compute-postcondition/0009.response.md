Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases from the function `func_3` and then calls the function `func_6` that many times. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the program is such that `func_6` has been called a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_3`. The side effects of `func_6` and the return value of `func_3` are not specified. **
