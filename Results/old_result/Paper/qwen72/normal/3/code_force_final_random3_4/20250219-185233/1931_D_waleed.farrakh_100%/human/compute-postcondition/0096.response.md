Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rx` is calculated using the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, and `freq` remain unchanged.
- The value of `a` is the third element of `arr`, and `rx` is the result of the expression applied to `a` and `x`.
