The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state provided already ensures that `t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which means the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop**
