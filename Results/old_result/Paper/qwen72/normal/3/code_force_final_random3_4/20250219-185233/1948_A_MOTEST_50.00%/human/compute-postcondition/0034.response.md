Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `ans` is an empty string.
- `x` is 0.

### After the if-else block executes:
- If `n` is even:
  - `ans` is the string 'AABBCC...XY' (where the length of `ans` is `n`).
  - `x` is `n // 2`.
  - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n` is odd:
  - `ans` is the string 'ABBACCDD...EE' (where 'EE' is the last pair of characters added, and the total number of characters in `ans` is `3 + 2 * (n // 2 - 1)`).
  - `x` is `n // 2`.
  - `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string 'YES'. The initial state and the if-else block do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the `print` statement is independent of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
