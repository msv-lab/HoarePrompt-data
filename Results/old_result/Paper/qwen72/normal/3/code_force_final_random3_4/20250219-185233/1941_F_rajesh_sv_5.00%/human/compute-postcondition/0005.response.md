The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`. The loop can execute again if `testcases` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the loop's execution, we do not need to adjust it. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` is the result of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been called, but its return value and any side effects are not specified.**
