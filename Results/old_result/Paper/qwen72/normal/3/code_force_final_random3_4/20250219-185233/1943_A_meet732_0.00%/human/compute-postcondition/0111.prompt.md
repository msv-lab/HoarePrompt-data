Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases, t, should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it indicates that the integer 0 does not appear in `a`. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` in the range from 1 to `n`. If `c` reaches 0 or `j` equals `n`, the loop breaks and `j` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appeared in the list `a`, and `n` is an input integer. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the count of the integer `0` in the list `a` is 0. Otherwise, `cntl[0]` is not 0, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of integers `j` in the range 1 to `n` (inclusive) for which `cntl[j]` is less than 2. If `c` reaches 0 or `j` reaches `n`, the loop breaks, and the value of `j` at this point is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and for each integer `i` in `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the current value of `cntl[0]` remains 0. Otherwise, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `n` is the length of the list `cntl` minus 1, and `j` is the first index (starting from 1) where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists. `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 before `c` reached 0 or `j` reached `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
