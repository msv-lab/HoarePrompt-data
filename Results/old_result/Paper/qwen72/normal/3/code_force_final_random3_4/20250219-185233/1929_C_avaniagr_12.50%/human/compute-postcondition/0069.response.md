Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time, `z` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 + (1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the initial state remains unchanged except for the value of `z`. The value of `z` is updated by adding the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. The new value of `z` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 + (1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
