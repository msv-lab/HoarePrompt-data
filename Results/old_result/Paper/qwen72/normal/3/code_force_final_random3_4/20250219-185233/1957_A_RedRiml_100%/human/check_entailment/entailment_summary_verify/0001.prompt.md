You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `w` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of elements, followed by a list of `ln` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of groups of three identical integers that can be formed from the list for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not modified by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w` and then processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`.

2. **Frequency Count**: The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length. This is a correct approach to determine how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Unique Stick Lengths**: The program maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths. This is not strictly necessary for the solution, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

4. **Shape Calculation**: The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl` and checks if the count of each stick length `d[j]` is at least 3. If so, it calculates the number of polygons that can be formed using these sticks by integer division `d[j] // 3`. This step is incorrect because it assumes that all polygons must have 3 sides (triangles), which is not the case. The problem statement allows for polygons with any number of sides (as long as they are regular).

5. **Output**: The program prints the total number of shapes `shapes` for each test case. However, due to the incorrect assumption in the shape calculation, the output will be incorrect for polygons with more than 3 sides.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it only considers triangles and not other regular polygons.

Correctness: **False**
