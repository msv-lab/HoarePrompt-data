Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the array.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip (1) in the array by reversing the array and finding the first chip in the reversed array. The index `y` is then adjusted to the original array's context by subtracting it from `n`.

3. **Extracting the Subarray**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the subarray from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive.

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0) in the subarray `z`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. The program handles all the given test cases correctly and efficiently.
