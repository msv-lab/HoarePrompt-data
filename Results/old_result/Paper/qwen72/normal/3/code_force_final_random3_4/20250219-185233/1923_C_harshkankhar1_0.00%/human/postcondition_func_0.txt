The function `func_1` processes an array `c` and a list of queries. It first reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input, where `n` is the length of the array `c` and `q` is the number of queries. It then reads the array `c` from the input and initializes an auxiliary array `b`. The function computes the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in `a`. For each query, represented by a tuple `(x, y)`, the function checks if the sum of the subarray `c[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum in the auxiliary array `b` or if `x == y`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all queries, the function terminates.
