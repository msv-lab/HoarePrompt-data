The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string, as the loop iterates over `s` in reverse order. The variable `j` will take on the value of each character in `s` starting from the last character.

Given the initial state, `s` is already described as a non-empty string, so it meets the condition for the loop to execute. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `j`, which will be set during the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the loop will start with `j` being the last character in `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the last character in `s`**
