Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element in `a`**

Explanation:
- The code updates the dictionary `cnt` by incrementing the count of the key `x` (the first element in `a`) by 1.
- Since `cnt` was initially an empty dictionary, the key `x` is added with a value of 1.
- The values of `ans`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
