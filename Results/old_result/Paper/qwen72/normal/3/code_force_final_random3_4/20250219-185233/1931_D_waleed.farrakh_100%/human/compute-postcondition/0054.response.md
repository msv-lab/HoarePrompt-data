Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `count += freq[rx, ry]` increments the value of `count` by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.
- `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, and `ry` is the result of `a % y`.
- `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)`.
- If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1.
- If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, it is added to `freq` with a value of 1, and `count` remains 0.
- The value of `count` is updated based on the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.

All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
