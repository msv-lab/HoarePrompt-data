Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect due to the logic in `func_2`. Specifically, the way the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons is calculated after placing the 2x2 icons is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It attempts to subtract the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on the screens used for 2x2 icons, but it does so in a way that doesn't accurately reflect the available space.
   - The correct approach should be to first place the 2x2 icons and then calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons on those screens. If there are still 1x1 icons left, they should be placed on additional screens.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The line `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect. It adds an extra screen unnecessarily when `x` is positive.
   - The correct approach should be to simply calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_2(x, y):
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
    
    # Calculate the remaining space on these screens for 1x1 icons
    remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4
    
    # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
    x -= min(x, remaining_space)
    
    # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
    additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
    
    # Total number of screens needed
    total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
    
    return total_screens

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_2(x, y))

func_3()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Calculate the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)` correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Each screen can hold at most 2 of these icons.

2. **Calculate the Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4` calculates the total number of cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons and subtracts the cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.

3. **Place the 1x1 Icons:**
   - `x -= min(x, remaining_space)` reduces the number of 1x1 icons by the number that can fit in the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons.

4. **Calculate Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

5. **Total Number of Screens:**
   - `total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1` gives the total number of screens required.

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly.
