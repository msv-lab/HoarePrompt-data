Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100 and x is greater than or equal to k - 2 and not equal to k - 1, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, `s` is the second line of the input file, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `z` is the result of the loop body being applied `x - k + 3` times.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The variable `k` remains an integer within the range 2 to 30.
- The variable `x` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100, and it is still greater than or equal to `k - 2` and not equal to `k - 1`.
- The variable `a` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^9.
- The variable `s` remains the second line of the input file.
- The loop runs `x - k + 3` times, so the variable `i` ends up being `x - k + 2` after the loop completes.
- The variable `z` is updated in each iteration of the loop. The final value of `z` is the result of applying the loop body `x - k + 3` times. Each iteration of the loop adds to `z` the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Therefore, `z` will be the sum of these updates over all iterations.
