You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The length of `ratings` is `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. Each rating in `ratings` is a distinct integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: `ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the beginning of the list up to the first element that is greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` up to the first element that is greater than `a[k - 1]`)
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the beginning of the list up to the first element that is greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists, and `wins` is less than `k`.
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` starting from `win_with_swap`, or `k - 1` if no such element exists. `win_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from `win_with_swap` up to `k - 1`. `k` remains unchanged.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins) (if wins is not 0) or win_with_swap - 1 (if wins is 0)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` and an integer `k`. The list `ratings` contains distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and `k` is the index of your cow. The function processes these inputs to determine the relative standing of your cow based on the ratings, but it does not return any value. The function is called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of `n` (the length of `ratings`) over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
