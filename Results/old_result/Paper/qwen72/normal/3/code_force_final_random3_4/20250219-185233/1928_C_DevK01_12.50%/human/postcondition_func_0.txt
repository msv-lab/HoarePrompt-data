The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients `q // i` that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `q` is a perfect square and its square root is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the square root is included in the list. The list `M` may be empty if no such divisors or quotients exist.
