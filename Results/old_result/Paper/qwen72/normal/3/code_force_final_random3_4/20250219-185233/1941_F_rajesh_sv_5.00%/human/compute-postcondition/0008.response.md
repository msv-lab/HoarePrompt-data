The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. Since there are no input parameters and no specific output details provided, the function could potentially return any value or perform any action, but based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact output. However, for the purpose of this task, we will assume that the function returns a value or performs an action that is not dependent on any input parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value or performs an action that is not dependent on any input parameters.**
