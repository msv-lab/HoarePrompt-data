Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, `_` is 0**

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input provided, which is split and converted to integers. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `_` remains 0.
