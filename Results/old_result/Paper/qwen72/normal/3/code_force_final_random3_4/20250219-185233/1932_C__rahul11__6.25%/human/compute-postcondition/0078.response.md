Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, the values of `res[c]`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the result of the expression `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `c` (which is incremented by 1) remain as they were in the initial state.
- The values of `res[c]`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by the code snippet and remain unchanged.
