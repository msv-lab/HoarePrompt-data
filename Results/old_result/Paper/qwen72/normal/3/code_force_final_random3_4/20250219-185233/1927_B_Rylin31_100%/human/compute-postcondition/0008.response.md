The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `array`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `array`. If `array` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in `array`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first element of `array`. For the loop to execute one more time, `array` must have at least one more element, and `j` will be the next element in `array`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, and the input value must be greater than 0; `l` is an input integer greater than 0; `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at index `j` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least two elements; `j` is the second element of `array`; `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table.**
