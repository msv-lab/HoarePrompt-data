Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is the first element in the list `inp`, `a` is the first element in the list `inp`, and `a` is greater than `x`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and the comparison `x == y` is False.***
