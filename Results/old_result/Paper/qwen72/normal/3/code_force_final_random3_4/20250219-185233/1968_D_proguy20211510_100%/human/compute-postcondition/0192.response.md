Postcondition: ***The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, and `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, `resb` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`, ensuring that `resb` is always greater than or equal to `ress`.***
