Output State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`, `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

The code snippet `mid = l + (h - l) // 2` recalculates the value of `mid` using the current values of `l` and `h`. The new value of `mid` is the same as the previous value of `mid`, so no changes occur in the output state. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
