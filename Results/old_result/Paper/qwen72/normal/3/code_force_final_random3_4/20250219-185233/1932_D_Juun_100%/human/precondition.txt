t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 16, a character representing the trump suit which is one of "CDHS", and a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing the cards, where the first character is the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character is the suit (one of "CDHS").
