Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[l] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is undefined because `mid + 1` is not within the bounds of `D`, `l` is equal to `h`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[1]` or -1 if no such element exists, `mid` is equal to `l`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[1]`, and the current value of `l` is equal to `h`.**

The code snippet updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
