The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs of elements in the corresponding `arr` list that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged after the function execution.
