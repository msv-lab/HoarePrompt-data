Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is the position of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the position `count`, and `done` is False. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins.**

The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to be skipped, and the next iteration begins. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
