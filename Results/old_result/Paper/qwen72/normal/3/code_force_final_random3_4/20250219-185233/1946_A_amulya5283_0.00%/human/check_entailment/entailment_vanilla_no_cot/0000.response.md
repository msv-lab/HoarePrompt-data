Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` from the list, converting the array elements to integers.

2. **Median Calculation**: For each test case, the program sorts the array `arr` and calculates the median index as `n // 2`. This is correct because the median of an array of length `n` is the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a min-heap to keep track of the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is a good approach because it allows efficient access to the smallest element in the heap, which is crucial for the operations needed to increase the median.

4. **Operation Counting**: The program initializes the number of operations to 0 and then enters a loop where it continues to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. Each increment is counted as an operation.

5. **Output**: The program collects the results for each test case and prints them one by one.

The logic and implementation are sound and should correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
