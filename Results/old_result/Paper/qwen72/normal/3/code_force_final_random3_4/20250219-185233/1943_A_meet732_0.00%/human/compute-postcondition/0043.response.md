The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the elements of `a`, and `i` takes on the value of the next element in `a` at the start of each iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `cntl[i]` is now 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two integers, and `i` must take on the value of the second integer in the list.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `n` is an input integer, `cntl[i]` is now 1**
