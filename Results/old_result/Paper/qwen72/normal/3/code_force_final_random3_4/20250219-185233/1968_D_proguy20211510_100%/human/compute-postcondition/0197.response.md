Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a space-separated string of integers from the user input, converts each string element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
