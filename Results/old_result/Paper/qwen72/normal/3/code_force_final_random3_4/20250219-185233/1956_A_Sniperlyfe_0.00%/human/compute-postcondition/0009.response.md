The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n` and the list `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has more integers, the loop will execute again with the next integer in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` was the first integer in `qs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least 2 integers, and `n` will be the second integer in `qs`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the second integer in `qs`.**
