The code snippet `xx.append(x)` appends the input string `x` to the list `xx`. The variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are not directly affected by this operation. However, the list `xx` is updated to include the string `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is `n`, `xx` is a list that now includes the string `x` as its last element.**
