Functionality: ** The function `func_3` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. It then calls the function `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` remains a non-negative integer within the specified range, and `func_2` has been executed `t` times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
