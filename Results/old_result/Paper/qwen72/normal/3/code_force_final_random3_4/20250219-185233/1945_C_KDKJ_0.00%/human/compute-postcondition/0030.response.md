Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is equal to `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`**

Explanation:
- `rsum` is assigned the value `n - lsum`.
- `lsum` is equal to `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`.
- Therefore, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `left`, `lsum`, and `right` remain unchanged.
