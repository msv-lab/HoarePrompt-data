Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`, if `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[left]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]` is appended to `new_arr`.**
