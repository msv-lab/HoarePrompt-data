The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `adv` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `adv` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`adv` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `ans` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[i - 1] - 1`**
