Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1`. This suggests that `t` is being decremented by 1. However, since `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, this implies that `t` was initially at least 1.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input.
   - `y` is the third integer from the input.
   - `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - `arr` is a list of `x` integers where each integer is the result of converting the corresponding string from the initial `arr` list to an integer.
   - The program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(x - 2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `x - 2`.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input.
   - Therefore, the output will be the value of `x` minus 2.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since `x` is the second integer from the input, the output will be `x - 2`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer from the input)**
