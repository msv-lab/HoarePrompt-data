Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appeared in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged. The list `cntl` now contains the counts of each integer in `a`. Specifically, the element at index `i` in `cntl` will be the number of times the integer `i` appeared in the list `a`. The variable `n` also remains unchanged.
