Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is `False`, and the last character of `a` is equal to the last character of `b`. Additionally, the character at the last position of `c` (i.e., `c[i]`) is not equal to the character at the last position of `a` (i.e., `a[i]`).**
