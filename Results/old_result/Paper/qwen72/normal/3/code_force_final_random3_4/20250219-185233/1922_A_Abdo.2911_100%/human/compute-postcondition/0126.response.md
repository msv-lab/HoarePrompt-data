Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] == a[i]`, `possible` remains unchanged. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]`, `possible` is set to True if the conditions in the loop body were met, otherwise `possible` remains unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
