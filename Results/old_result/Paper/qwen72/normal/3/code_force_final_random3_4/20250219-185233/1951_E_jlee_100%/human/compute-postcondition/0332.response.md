Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `count` is now equal to `j`, `done` remains False, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
