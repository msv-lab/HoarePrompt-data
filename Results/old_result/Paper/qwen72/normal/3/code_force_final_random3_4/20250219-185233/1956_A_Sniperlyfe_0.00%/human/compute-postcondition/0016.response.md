The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be decremented by 1, but since the loop variable `_` is not used, it does not need to be explicitly mentioned in the state.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in `qs`** 

However, to be more precise and reflect the change in `t` for the next iteration:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in `qs`**
