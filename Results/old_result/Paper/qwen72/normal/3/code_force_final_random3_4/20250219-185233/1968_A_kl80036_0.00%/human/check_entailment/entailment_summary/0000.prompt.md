Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

# Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and calculates `y` as `x // 2`. The function then prints `y` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes `t` being an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` being `t-1`, and `x` being the last input integer greater than 0, with `y` being the integer result of `x` divided by 2.
