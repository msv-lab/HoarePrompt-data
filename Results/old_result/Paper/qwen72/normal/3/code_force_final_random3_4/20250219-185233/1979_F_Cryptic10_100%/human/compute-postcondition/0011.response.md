Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1` and `v3`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)`, `_` is assigned the second value returned by `q(0)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` appends the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`.
- The initial state specifies that `ops` is an empty list, so after the code execution, `ops` contains the two tuples.
- The other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`) are not affected by the code snippet, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.
