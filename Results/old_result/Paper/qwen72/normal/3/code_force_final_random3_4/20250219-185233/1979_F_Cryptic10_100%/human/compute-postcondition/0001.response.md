The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The lambda function `q` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable**
