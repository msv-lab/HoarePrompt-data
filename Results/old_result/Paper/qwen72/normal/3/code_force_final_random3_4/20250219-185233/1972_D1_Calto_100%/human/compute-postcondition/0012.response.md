Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 6`, `y` is 9, `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1 + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0) + math.ceil((n - 6) / 9) + ((n - 6) % 9 == 0)`**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` to its previous value.
- `x` is `n - 6`.
- `y` is 9.
- `math.ceil(x / y)` calculates the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`.
- `(x % y == 0)` evaluates to 1 if `x` is divisible by `y` and 0 otherwise.
- The new value of `cnt` is the sum of its previous value and the result of `math.ceil((n - 6) / 9) + ((n - 6) % 9 == 0)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
