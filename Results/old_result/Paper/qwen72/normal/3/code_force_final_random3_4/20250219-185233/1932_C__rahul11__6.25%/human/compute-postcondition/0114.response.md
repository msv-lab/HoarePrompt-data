The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute because `range(n - 1)` will have at least one value (0) for `k` to iterate over. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains unchanged
- `k` is `n - 2`

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` should start at 0.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
