Postcondition: ***`i` is 29, `length` is 30 or 31, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[30]` is '1', and `s[29]` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `length` remains 30, `s` remains a list of 30 elements, and `s[29]` is not '0'.***
