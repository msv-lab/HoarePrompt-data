The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is either 0 or 1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `j` is `n + 2`, `r` is 2, and `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `sum` is `n + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**
