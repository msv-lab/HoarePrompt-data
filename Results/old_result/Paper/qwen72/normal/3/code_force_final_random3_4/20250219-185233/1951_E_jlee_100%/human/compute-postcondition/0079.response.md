Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if `count2` is greater than or equal to `count` (with `done` being True if `count2` is greater than `count`, and `done` remaining False if `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1). If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1 and `done` remains False. If `count` is 0, `count` remains 0 and `done` remains False.***
