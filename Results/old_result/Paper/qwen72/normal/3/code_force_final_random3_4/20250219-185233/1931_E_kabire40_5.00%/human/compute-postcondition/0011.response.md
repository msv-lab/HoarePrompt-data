Postcondition: ***`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is set to the first element of `operational_list` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.***
