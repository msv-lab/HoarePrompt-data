Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>', `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains the same as the initial input integer.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`maxi`**: This variable will hold the last value of `i` for which the input `res` was '<'. If `res` was never '<', `maxi` will remain 0.
- **`arr`**: The list `arr` remains unchanged and still contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order.
- **`mini`**: This variable remains the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>'. If `res` was never '>', `mini` will remain 0.
- **`item`**: This variable remains the last element in `arr`, which is `n-1`.
- **`_`**: This variable is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`. The exact value of `_` will depend on the number of iterations the loop completes, but it will be `n-1` after the loop finishes.
