Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `n` is greater than `len(pans)`.
   - `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
   - `i` is 1, so `pans[i]` is `pans[1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `pans[0]`, `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[1]`.

Since `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `mak` is 0, the values `pans[0]` and `pans[1]` are the first and second elements of the list `pans`, respectively.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the list `pans` and [pans[1]] is the second element of the list `pans`)**
