### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move.
   - After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer between `0` and `n` (inclusive), depending on the sequence of moves.
   - The key observation is that the parity (even or odd) of the number of cubes in the tower changes with each move. Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower will have the same parity as `n`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is incorrect.
   - The correct condition should be that `n` and `m` must have the same parity (both even or both odd).

4. **Evaluating the Condition**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
   - If `n` and `m` have the same parity, their difference will be even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `n` is at least as large as `m`, which is necessary because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time.

5. **Correctness of the Condition**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is indeed correct for checking if `n` and `m` have the same parity.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` is also necessary to ensure that it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

6. **Example Case**:
   - For `n = 3` and `m = 2`:
     - `n - m = 1` which is odd.
     - The program correctly prints `No` because `(n - m) % 2 != 0`.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is incorrect in stating that the program fails for the case `n = 3` and `m = 2`.
   - The program correctly checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity and if `n` is at least as large as `m`.
   - The program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
