Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, for each position `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` now includes the index `i`, otherwise the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, for each position `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` now includes the index `i`, otherwise the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged, `j` is 1. If the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` is not `?`, then `nx` is a string containing the character at position 0 of `xx[3]`. If the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` is `?` and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, for each position `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` now includes the index `i`, otherwise the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged, `j` is 2, and `nx` is a string. If the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` is not `?`, `nx` is the string containing the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` followed by the character at position 1 of `xx[3]`. If the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` is `?` and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, for each position `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` now includes the index `i`, otherwise the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged, `j` is 3, and `nx` is a string. If the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` is not `?`, `nx` is the string containing the characters at positions 0, 1, and 2 of `xx[3]`. If the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` is `?` and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, if the character at position 0 of `xx[3]` is `?` and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` is 'F'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
