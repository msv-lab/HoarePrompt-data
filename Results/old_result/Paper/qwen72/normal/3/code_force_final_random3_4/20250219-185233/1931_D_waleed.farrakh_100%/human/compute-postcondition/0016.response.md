Output State: **`data` is a list of lines from the input, `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, x, y, arr)` and `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 5, `n` is the first integer from the line at index 5 of `data`, `x` is the second integer from the line at index 5 of `data`, `y` is the third integer from the line at index 5 of `data`, `arr` is a list of integers from the line at index 4 of `data`**

Explanation:
- The code `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` updates the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` based on the line at index `5` of `data`.
- The previous values of `n`, `x`, and `y` (which were derived from the line at index `3` of `data`) are no longer valid.
- The value of `arr` remains unchanged, as it is still derived from the line at index `4` of `data`.
- The values of `data`, `t`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
- The value of `idx` remains `5`.
