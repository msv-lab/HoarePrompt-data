### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - `func_1` reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sum array `S` is correctly constructed. `S[i][0]` and `S[i][1]` store the cumulative counts of zeros and ones up to the i-th house, respectively.
   - This allows for efficient calculation of the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road for any position `i`.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program iterates through each possible position `i` where the road can be laid (from 0 to n-1).
   - For each position, it calculates the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road using the prefix sum array `S`.
   - It checks if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the total houses on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
   - It checks if the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the total houses on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).

4. **Optimal Position Selection:**
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`n / 2`) than the previously stored position.
   - The program ensures that the road is laid as close to the middle of the village as possible by comparing the absolute differences.
   - In case of a tie, it correctly outputs the smaller position.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The prefix sum array `S` is correctly constructed and used to efficiently calculate the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road for each possible position.
- The conditions for satisfaction are correctly checked using the prefix sums.
- The program ensures that the road is laid as close to the middle of the village as possible by comparing the absolute differences.
- The program handles edge cases where the road can be laid before the first house or after the last house.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the logic for finding the optimal position is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
