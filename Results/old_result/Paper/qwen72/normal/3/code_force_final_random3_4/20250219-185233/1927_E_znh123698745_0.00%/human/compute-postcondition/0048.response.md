Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `answer` has a new element appended from `array` at the index `a[-1] - 1`, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.** 

The value of `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, so the new element appended to `answer` is from the index `a[-1] - 1` in `array`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
