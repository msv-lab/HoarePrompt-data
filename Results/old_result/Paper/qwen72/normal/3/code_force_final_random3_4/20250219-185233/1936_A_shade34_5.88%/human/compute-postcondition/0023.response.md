Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `_` has completed its iterations, which implies that any loops or operations that `_` was involved in have finished.
   - `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `pans` is an empty list.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is 0, as specified in the initial state.
   - The print statement will output a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The question mark `?` will be printed as is.
   - `mak` will be printed as the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given.
   - `mak2` will be printed as the same value as `mak`.
   - `i` will be printed as 0.
   - `mak2` will be printed again as the same value as `mak`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given)**
