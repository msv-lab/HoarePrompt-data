The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1` (as `range(1, n)` does not include `n` itself). Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, but this state is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
