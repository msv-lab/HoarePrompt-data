Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the final state is as follows: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`. `ops` is a list containing all tuples generated during the loop execution, where each tuple represents an operation. `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. The final output is a string "! " followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order and then the elements of `p2` in the order they were appended.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the set `vx` will have exactly 2 elements left, which are the remaining integers from the original set. The list `ops` will contain all the operations that were performed during the loop, each represented as a tuple. The lists `p1` and `p2` will be populated based on the conditions described in the loop, with `p1` containing elements that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation, and `p2` containing elements that did match. Finally, the program will print the elements of `p1` in reverse order followed by the elements of `p2`, all separated by spaces, and prefixed with "! ".
