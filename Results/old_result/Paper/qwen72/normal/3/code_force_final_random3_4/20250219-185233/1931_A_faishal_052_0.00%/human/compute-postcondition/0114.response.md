The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the `range` value, which is 2 in this case. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to the `range` value. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. However, since the loop condition is `j in range(2)`, the loop will not execute again because `j` will be equal to the upper limit of the range (which is non-inclusive).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the last iteration) is:
State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 27`. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.** 

However, since `j` is now 2, the loop will not execute again.
