### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` starts by reading an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, each time reading an integer `n` and a string `s`.
   - This part of the code is correct and follows the expected input format.

2. **Test Case for `n == 2`**:
   - If `n == 2`, the function checks if the string `s` is '00'. If it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct because if `n == 2`, the only valid string is '00' (since '01', '10', and '11' would not satisfy the conditions of being able to split the string into two equal parts with the same number of '1's).

3. **General Case for `n > 2`**:
   - The function counts the number of '1's in the string `s` and stores it in `count_1`.
   - It then checks if `count_1` is odd. If it is, it prints 'NO' because the string cannot be divided into two equal parts with the same number of '1's.
   - This is correct and follows the problem's logic.
   - If `count_1` is even, it further checks if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' and `count_1` is exactly 2. If both conditions are true, it prints 'NO' because the string cannot be divided into two equal parts with the same number of '1's.
   - This is also correct. The condition `s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2` ensures that the string has exactly one '11' and two '1's, which means it cannot be split into two equal parts with the same number of '1's.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES'.
   - This is correct because if the string has an even number of '1's and does not have exactly one '11' and two '1's, it can be split into two equal parts with the same number of '1's.

4. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are logically consistent with the problem description.
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and general cases as described.
