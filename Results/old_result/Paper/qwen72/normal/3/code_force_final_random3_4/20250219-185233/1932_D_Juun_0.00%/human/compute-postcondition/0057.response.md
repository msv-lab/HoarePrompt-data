Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is an empty list or contains the remaining elements that were not used. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit. If `trumps` became empty before all non-`None` values in `suits` were processed, the program returned 'IMPOSSIBLE' and did not complete all iterations.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `suits` dictionary will have all its values that were not `None` at the start processed. The `trumps` list will either be empty or will contain the remaining elements that were not used during the loop. The `answers` list will have been updated with strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not the `trump` suit), where each string is formatted as the rank of the card followed by its suit, and then the rank of the trump card followed by the trump suit. If the `trumps` list became empty before all non-`None` values in `suits` were processed, the program would have returned 'IMPOSSIBLE' and stopped executing the loop.
