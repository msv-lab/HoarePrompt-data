Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 2
```
func_2()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The function `func_2()` is called, but the definition of `func_2()` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact impact of this function call on the variables or the program state. However, since the function call does not explicitly modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, we assume that the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 2, and `func_2()` has been called.**
