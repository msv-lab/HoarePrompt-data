The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is such that `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9` and `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

For the loop to execute, `x` must be at least 1 because the range starts from 1. If `x` is 0 or negative, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` will be 1, but the range will not include any values, and the loop will not execute. Therefore, `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 1, so it does not need to be adjusted.

The variables `output1` and `output2` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list**
