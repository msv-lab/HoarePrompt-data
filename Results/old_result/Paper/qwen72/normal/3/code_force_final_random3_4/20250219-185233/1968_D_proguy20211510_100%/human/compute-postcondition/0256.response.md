Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of `0` and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1] + pathb[2]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `curr` is `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, and `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet `preb += pathb[i]` updates the value of `preb` by adding the value of `pathb[2]` to it. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `preb` is now `pathb[0] + pathb[1] + pathb[2]`. The value of `resb` is still the maximum of `0` and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, and `curr` is still `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, but `preb` has been updated. The condition `if k < i + 1` remains the same, and if it is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
