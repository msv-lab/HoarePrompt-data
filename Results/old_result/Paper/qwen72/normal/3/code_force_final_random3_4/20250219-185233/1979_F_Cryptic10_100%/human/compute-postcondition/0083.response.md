Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` where `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) minus the integer `v1`. `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. The current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**
