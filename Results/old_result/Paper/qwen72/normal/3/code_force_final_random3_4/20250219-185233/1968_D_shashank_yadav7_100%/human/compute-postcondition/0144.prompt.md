Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n` (the new value of `n` from input), `t` must be greater than `n` (the new value of `n` from input), `k` is the new value of `k` from input, `b` is the new value of `b` from input minus 1, `s` is the new value of `s` from input minus 1, `bm` is now equal to `a[b] * k`, `sm` is now equal to `a[s] * k`, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than `n`, `k` is the new value of `k` from input minus 1, `b` is the new value of `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is the new value of `p[s]` minus 1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is equal to `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is the new value of `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than `n`, `k` is the new value of `k` from input minus 2, `b` is the new value of `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is the new value of `p[s]` minus 1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is equal to `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is the new value of `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `t` is greater than `n`, `k` is the new value of `k` from input minus 3, `b` is the new value of `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is the new value of `p[s]` minus 1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is equal to `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is the new value of `a[b] + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
