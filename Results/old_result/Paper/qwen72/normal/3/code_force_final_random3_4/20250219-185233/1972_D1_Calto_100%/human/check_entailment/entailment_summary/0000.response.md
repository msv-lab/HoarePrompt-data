Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` does not directly address the problem statement. The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` are not derived from the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the function `func_2` does not perform this check. Instead, it uses a different formula that does not seem to be related to the problem's requirements.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The provided output hints for `func_2` suggest that it is performing some kind of summation, but the formula used is not aligned with the problem's conditions.
   - The output of `func_2` does not match the expected output for the given test cases. For example, in the first test case with \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), but the function's logic does not reflect this.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
