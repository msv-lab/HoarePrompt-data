Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each one. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Special Character Condition**: The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is part of a pair. This is correct because each special character must be matched with a neighbor, and an odd number of such characters cannot be paired without leaving one unpaired.

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each '1' in the string is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other '1' in the pair '11'). The '0' in the pattern is not a special character because it is not equal to either of its neighbors. This is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

4. **String Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. However, the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is a solution of length at most 200. Since the pattern '110' is used and `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is always less than 200. Therefore, the length check is redundant and can be removed. Despite this redundancy, the length check does not affect the correctness of the program for the given constraints.

5. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the output in the required format for each test case: 'NO' if no solution exists, or 'YES' followed by the constructed string if a solution exists. The output format is consistent with the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct and adheres to the problem's constraints and requirements. The redundancy in the length check does not impact the correctness of the program for the given input range.

Final: **True**
