Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr`. If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` is set to -1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
