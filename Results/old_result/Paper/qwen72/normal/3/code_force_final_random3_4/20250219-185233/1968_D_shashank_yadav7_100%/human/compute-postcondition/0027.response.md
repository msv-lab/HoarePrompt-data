Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer minus 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[p[s] - 1]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[p[b] - 1]`. If `k` is 0, `bm` and `sm` are both set to -1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, and `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `k` being 0 and the subsequent updates to `bm` and `sm` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The new value of `s` is `p[s] - 1`, which means `s` is now the value at index `s` in the list `p`, minus 1.
