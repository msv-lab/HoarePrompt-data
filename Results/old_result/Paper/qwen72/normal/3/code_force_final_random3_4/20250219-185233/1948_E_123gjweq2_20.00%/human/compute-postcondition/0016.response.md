Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.**

Explanation:
- The code `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the list `cliquess` at the index `left + mid + i`.
- The value of `left + mid + i` is calculated as follows:
  - `left` is a non-negative integer.
  - `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
  - `i` is 0.
  - Therefore, `left + mid + i` simplifies to `left + (right - left) // 2`.
- The value of `clique` is a positive integer.
- The state of all other variables remains unchanged.
