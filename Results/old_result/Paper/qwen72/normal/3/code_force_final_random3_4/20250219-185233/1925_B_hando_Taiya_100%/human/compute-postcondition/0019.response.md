Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of `x // 2` (if `x` is divisible by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`) and 3, provided that `n` is less than or equal to `x // 3`. If `n` is greater than `x // 3`, `ans` remains the value it had before the if statement, which is `x // 2` if `x` is divisible by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.***
