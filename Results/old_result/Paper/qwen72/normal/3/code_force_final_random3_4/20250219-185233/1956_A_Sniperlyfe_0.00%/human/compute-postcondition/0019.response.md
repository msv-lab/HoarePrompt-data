Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in `qs`**

The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `qs` to a list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `res`) remain unchanged, and their initial conditions still hold. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `qs` and the unchanged initial conditions of the other variables.
