Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the smallest pile size is 1, but the other piles have sizes that are all consecutive integers starting from 2. In such a case, the program should return "Bob" because Alice can only remove 1 stone from each pile on her first turn, and then Bob can remove the remaining stones in the next turn, winning the game. However, the program incorrectly returns "Alice" in this scenario.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
Expected output:
```
Bob
```
Actual output:
```
Alice
```
