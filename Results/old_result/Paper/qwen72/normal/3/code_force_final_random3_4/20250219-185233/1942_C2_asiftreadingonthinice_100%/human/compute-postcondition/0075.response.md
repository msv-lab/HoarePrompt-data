Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list that contains the single element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**
