Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` has been decremented to 0, meaning all test cases have been processed.
- For each test case, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the values provided by the user.
- The lists `a` and `b` have been updated to the lists of integers provided by the user for each test case.
- The variables `len_a` and `len_b` are the lengths of the lists `a` and `b`, respectively.
- The variable `d` is calculated as `k // 2`.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, which is the last index of the longest list between `a` and `b`.
- The variables `count_a` and `count_b` have been updated to the number of elements in `a` and `b`, respectively, that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.
- The loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether `count_a` and `count_b` are both greater than or equal to `d`.
