Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`. If `a[i] == tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0.***
