The code snippet `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and the value of `arr` depends on the value of `res`.

- If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`. After appending `i` (which is 2), `arr` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]`. After appending `i` (which is 2), `arr` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`.
- If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]`. After appending `i` (which is 2), `arr` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1, 2]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. `res` is now the input value.**
