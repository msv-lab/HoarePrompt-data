### Reasoning:

1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the MEX calculation is not explicitly defined in the code. The MEX of a subarray should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the code does not compute this value. Instead, it seems to use a heuristic that does not match the MEX definition.

2. **Global Variables**:
   - The original assessment is correct in noting that the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` rely on global variables `arr` and `res_dict`. This is a valid concern as it can lead to undefined behavior if these variables are not properly initialized or if the program is used in a different context.

3. **Incorrect MEX Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` for computing the MEX and the maximum sum is indeed incorrect. The MEX should be computed based on the actual elements in the subarray, but the code uses a heuristic that does not reflect this. For example, the line `res = (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2` is not a valid MEX calculation and does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Recursive Depth**:
   - The recursive depth in `func_1` and `func_2` can be very high, especially for larger subarrays. This can lead to stack overflow or excessive computation time, which is a valid concern.

5. **Stair Construction**:
   - The `make_stairs` function is intended to construct a specific pattern, but it does not correctly handle the transformation of the subarray to the MEX value. The function assumes that the MEX is the length of the subarray, which is not always the case. The function also does not correctly update the array to reflect the MEX value.

### Detailed Analysis of Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
  - The base case is correct when `start_index` equals `end_index`, but the MEX value should be 0 if the element at that index is 0, and 1 otherwise.
  - The recursive case tries to split the subarray and compute the sum of the results of these splits plus the MEX of the split point. However, the MEX value is not correctly computed. The line `res = (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2` is incorrect and does not represent the MEX.
  - The function should compute the MEX of the subarray and use this value in the recursive calculations.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
  - The base case for subarray length 1 is correct, but the MEX value should be 0 if the element is 0, and 1 otherwise.
  - The condition `if (max_value == length ** 2)` is incorrect because the MEX value is not the square of the subarray length.
  - The recursive calls to `func_2` are based on incorrect MEX values, leading to incorrect operations.

- **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**:
  - The function is intended to transform a subarray into a specific pattern where the elements form a sequence from 0 to the length of the subarray minus 1.
  - The function assumes that the MEX is the length of the subarray, which is not always the case.
  - The function does not correctly update the array to reflect the MEX value. It sets all elements in the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the MEX calculation and the logic for maximizing the sum of the array. It relies on incorrect heuristics and does not handle the MEX value correctly. Additionally, the use of global variables and potential issues with recursive depth further undermine the correctness of the program.

Final: **False**
