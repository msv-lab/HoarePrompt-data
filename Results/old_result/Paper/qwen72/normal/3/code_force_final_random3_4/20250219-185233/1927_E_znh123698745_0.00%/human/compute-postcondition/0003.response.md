Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and k is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1.**

The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and k is even. The `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The code snippet initializes the `answer` list with the integer 1. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the updated value of `answer`.
