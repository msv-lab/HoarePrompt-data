Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is `c + 2`, and `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`. If the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is 'L', `ans` is `ans // arr[1] % MOD` and `l` is 2. Otherwise, if the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is not 'L', `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is `r - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `c` is `c + 1` (which was already `c + 1` in the initial state, so now it is `c + 2`).
- The values of `n`, `k`, `res[c]`, `ans`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
