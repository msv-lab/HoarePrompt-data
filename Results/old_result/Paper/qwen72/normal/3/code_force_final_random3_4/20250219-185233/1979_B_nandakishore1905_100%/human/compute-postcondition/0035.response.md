Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - The absolute difference between two numbers `n` and `m` is calculated as \( |n - m| \).

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `k` in terms of `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
