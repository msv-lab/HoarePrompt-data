To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to consider the condition in the loop head: `heap[0] <= current_median`.

The variables involved in this condition are `heap` and `current_median`. Let's break down the state and see what adjustments are necessary:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of t tuples
- `results` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`
- `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`
- `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end
- `operations` is 0

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`heap[0]`**: This is the root of the min-heap, which is the smallest element in the heap.
2. **`current_median`**: This is the value at the median index of the sorted array `arr`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true. 

- **`heap[0]`**: Since `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap.
- **`current_median`**: This is the value at the median index of the sorted array `arr`.

### Adjustments:
- The condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true for the loop to execute.
- Since `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap. For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the current state, `heap` is constructed from elements starting from the median index to the end of the sorted array `arr`. Therefore, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in this subarray, which is the median itself if `n` is odd, or one of the two middle elements if `n` is even.

### Conclusion:
- The condition `heap[0] <= current_median` will always be true because `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, and the heap starts from the median index of the sorted array `arr`.

Since the condition is already guaranteed to be true based on the given state, no adjustments are necessary.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `operations` is 0**
