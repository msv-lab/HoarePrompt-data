Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is now a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is -infinity, `next_max_diff` is -infinity, and `index` is None.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is now a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]`, `index` is set to 1, and `next_max_diff` remains -infinity. Otherwise, if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]`, and `index` remains None. If `diff` is not greater than `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains -infinity, and `index` remains None.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, `index` is set to 2, and `next_max_diff` remains -infinity. If `diff` is not greater than `max_diff` but `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is set to `A[2] - A[1]`, and `index` remains 2 or None depending on the previous state. If `diff` is not greater than `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains -infinity, and `index` remains None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, `index` is set to 3, and `next_max_diff` remains -infinity. If `diff` is not greater than `max_diff` but `diff` > `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, and `index` remains 3 or 2 or None depending on the previous state. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains -infinity, and `index` remains None.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
