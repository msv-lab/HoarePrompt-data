### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n`, the first row `a`, and the second row `b`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (i.e., `b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`) and immediately prints `NO` if this condition is met. This is a valid check because if the robot is in the second row and the second-to-last cell is not pointing to the right, it cannot move to the last cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The program checks if `n` is 1 and prints `YES` if true. However, the problem description states that `n` is always at least 2, so this check is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness.

4. **Path Checking:**
   - The program then checks if there is a path from the starting cell `(1, 1)` to the target cell `(2, n)` by examining the arrows in the grid.
   - It first assumes that there is no path (`no_path = True`).
   - It then iterates over the cells in the second row at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). If any of these cells do not point to the right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it performs a similar check on the cells in the first row at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...). If any of these cells do not point to the right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, it prints `YES`, indicating that the robot can reach the target cell.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Issues:
- **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
  - This check is indeed unnecessary and can be removed because the problem guarantees that `n` is at least 2.

- **Path Checking Logic:**
  - The logic for checking the path is flawed. The program assumes that if any cell in the second row at even indices or any cell in the first row at odd indices does not point to the right, then there is no path. However, this is not a valid assumption.
  - The robot can move in multiple directions (left, right, up, down) and can follow the arrows in the grid. The current logic does not account for the robot's ability to move up and down between rows, which is crucial for determining if a path exists.
  - Specifically, the program does not consider the possibility that the robot can move from the first row to the second row or vice versa, and it does not check the entire grid for a valid path.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for determining if the robot can reach the target cell is incorrect. It fails to consider the full range of movements the robot can make and the interactions between the arrows in the two rows.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic is flawed and does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

Final: **False**
