Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The program only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array after rearranging to maximize the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2` because the array can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`. However, the program will output `2` because it calculates `3 - 1 = 2`, which is coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason.

Another example:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1` because the array can be rearranged to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, and the beauty is `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`. However, the program will output `1` because it calculates `4 - 3 = 1`, which is again coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason.

The program fails to handle the requirement of rearranging the array to maximize the beauty, and it does not correctly compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, it is incorrect.
