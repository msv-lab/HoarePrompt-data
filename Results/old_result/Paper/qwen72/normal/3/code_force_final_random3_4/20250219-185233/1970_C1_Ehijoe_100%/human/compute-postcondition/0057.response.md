Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing all the nodes from `s` to `e` (inclusive) and now includes `e` as the last element, `prev` is the last node added to `tree` before the loop terminated, and `curr` is equal to `e`.**
