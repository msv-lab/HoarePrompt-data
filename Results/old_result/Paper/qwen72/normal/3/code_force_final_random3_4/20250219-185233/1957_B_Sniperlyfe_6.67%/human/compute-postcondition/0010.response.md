Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is now \(k - n \cdot (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\), and `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\).**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `n` does not change.
- The loop index `i` reaches `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- The value of `k` is reduced by \(n \cdot (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\), where `n` is the number of iterations.
- The list `nums` now contains `n` elements, and each element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\).
