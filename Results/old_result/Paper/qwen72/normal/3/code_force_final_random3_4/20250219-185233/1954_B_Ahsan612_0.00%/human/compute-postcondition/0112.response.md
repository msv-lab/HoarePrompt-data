Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least four elements, `len(ar)` is greater than 4. If `ar[1]` is equal to `num` (which is the first element of `ar`), `same` is 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 2. If `ar[4]` is equal to `num`, `i` is 5, `num` is updated to either the third or fourth element of `ar`, and `minn` is 1. If `ar[4]` is not equal to `num`, `i` is 6, `same` is 1, `num` is the sixth element of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of 1 and `same`.**
