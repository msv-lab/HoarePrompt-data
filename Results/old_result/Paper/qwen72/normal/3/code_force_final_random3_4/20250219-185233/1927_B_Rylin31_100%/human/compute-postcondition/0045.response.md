Output State: **`i` is incremented by the length of `array`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 3 and all other elements still initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the new ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` after the first increment, and then followed by the character corresponding to the new ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` after the second increment, and finally followed by the character corresponding to the new ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` after the third increment, `j` is the third element in `array`.**
