Postcondition: **`ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list and must be greater than 2, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is 2, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
