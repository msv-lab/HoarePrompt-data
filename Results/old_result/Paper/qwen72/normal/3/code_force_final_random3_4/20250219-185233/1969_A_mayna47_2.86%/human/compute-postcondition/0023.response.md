Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user input and a list of integers `v` of length `n`. It then checks if `n` is 2, in which case it prints 2 and returns. If `n` is greater than 2, it iterates through the list `v` and checks if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. If this condition is met at any point, it prints 2 and returns. If the condition is never met, it prints 3 and returns. The function does not modify any external variables or parameters and always returns nothing. **
