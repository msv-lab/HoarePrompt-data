Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if the second-to-last character in `b` is '>'. If it is not, the function prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the first row to the second row by examining the characters at even and odd indices in `a` and `b`. If all characters at even indices in `b` are '>' and all characters at odd indices in `a` are '>', the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. **
