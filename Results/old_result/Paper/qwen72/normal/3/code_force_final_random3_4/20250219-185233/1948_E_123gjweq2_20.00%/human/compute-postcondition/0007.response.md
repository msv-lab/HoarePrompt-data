The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `mid`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr[left]` is `left + 1`.
- `cliquess[left]` is `clique`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `mid` remains the same, which is `(right - left) // 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`, `i` is 1, `arr[left]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left]` is `clique`**
