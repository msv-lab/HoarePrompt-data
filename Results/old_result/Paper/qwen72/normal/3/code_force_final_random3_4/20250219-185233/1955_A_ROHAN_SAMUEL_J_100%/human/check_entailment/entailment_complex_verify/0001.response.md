### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price, which is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price, which is `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly. If `n` is 1, it will always be cheaper to buy one yogurt at the regular price `a`.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is 2 correctly. If `n` is 2, it will compare the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) with the promotion price (`b`).

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is correct. It ensures that Maxim buys the yogurts in the most cost-effective way by comparing the regular price and the promotion price for pairs of yogurts and handling the odd case by adding the cost of one additional yogurt.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(1 \le a, b \le 30\).

- **State of the program within the function**:
  - For each test case:
    - If `n` is odd:
      - If `2 * a < b`, the program prints `a * n`.
      - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`.
    - If `n` is even:
      - If `2 * a < b`, the program prints `a * n`.
      - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b`.

- **Final State of the program**:
  - After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, which is expected as the problem only requires printing the results.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 9`, the program prints `a * n = 10`.
  - **Expected Output**: 10 (but the correct output should be 9, as the promotion price is cheaper).

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10` is greater than `b = 9`, the program prints `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - **Expected Output**: 14 (correct).

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`, the program prints `a * n = 15`.
  - **Expected Output**: 15 (correct).

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`, the program prints `a * n = 20`.
  - **Expected Output**: 20 (correct).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is mostly correct, but there is a small mistake in the reasoning for the even number of yogurts. Specifically, the program should print `b` if `n` is 2 and `2 * a > b`, not `a * n`. This is a critical edge case that the original assessment missed.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n` is 2 and `2 * a > b` correctly. The program should print `b` in this case, but it prints `a * n` instead. This can be fixed by adding a specific check for `n == 2` before the even case logic.
