The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap. Given the initial state, `smallest + 1` is already in the heap twice, and now it will be added a third time. The heap will still maintain its heap property, and the smallest element in the heap will be `smallest + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, but the first element (which was equal to `current_median`) has been removed and `smallest + 1` has been added three times, `smallest` is the second smallest value in the original heap (which was the value of `current_median` before the first element was removed and `smallest + 1` was added), `operations` is 2, `smallest + 1` must be less than or equal to `current_median`, and `smallest` is now the third smallest value in the original heap.**
