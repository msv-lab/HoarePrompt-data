Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000, `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is set to `n - 2`. The initial conditions for `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
