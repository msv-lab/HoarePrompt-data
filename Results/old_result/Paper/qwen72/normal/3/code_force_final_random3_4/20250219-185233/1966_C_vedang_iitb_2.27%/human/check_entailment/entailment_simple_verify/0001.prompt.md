You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    Alice

    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves `n` piles of stones.
   - Players take turns to remove `k` stones from each nonempty pile, where `k` is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and we need to determine the winner assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function takes a list `a` of pile sizes and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list of pile sizes.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the pile sizes into a form that can be used to determine the winner more easily.
   - The transformation is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and then computing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function takes a list `a` of transformed pile sizes and an integer `n` representing the number of piles.
   - It recursively determines the winner of the game.
   - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can always remove all stones.
   - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd. If it is even, Alice wins; if it is odd, Bob wins.
   - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks if the next player (after removing the smallest pile) can win. If the next player can win, the current player loses, and vice versa.

4. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The transformation in `func_1` is crucial because it simplifies the problem by reducing the pile sizes to their differences. This transformation helps in determining the parity (even or odd) of the smallest pile, which is a key factor in the game's outcome.
   - The recursive function `func_2` correctly handles the base cases and the recursive case. It checks if the next player can win and uses this information to determine the current player's outcome.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there is only one pile correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where there are two piles correctly by checking the parity of the smallest pile.
   - For more than two piles, the recursive approach ensures that the function correctly determines the winner by considering the optimal moves for both players.

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The transformation in `func_1` is correct and necessary for the recursive function to work.
   - The recursive function `func_2` correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the transformed pile sizes.
   - The program should correctly determine the winner for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
