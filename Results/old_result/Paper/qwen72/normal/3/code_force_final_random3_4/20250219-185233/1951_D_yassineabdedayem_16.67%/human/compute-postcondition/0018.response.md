To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:
```
while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition `n != 0`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - This condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

2. **Condition `k > 0`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is a positive integer.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is set to 0.
   - If `k` is set to 0, the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must not be set to 0. This means `Max` should not equal `k` or `n * Min` should be greater than `k`.

3. **Condition `rep < 60`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `rep` is 1.
   - This condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `rep`.

4. **Condition `n >= k`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - This condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `n` or `k`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `k`. Specifically, `k` must remain positive and not be set to 0. This can be achieved by ensuring that `Max` does not equal `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is equal to `Min` and `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is set to `k - Min`. `n` is now equal to `n - Min * Max`, and `k` must remain positive.**
