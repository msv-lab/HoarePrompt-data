Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 2, `n - j` must be greater than 2. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program does not return any value. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.***
