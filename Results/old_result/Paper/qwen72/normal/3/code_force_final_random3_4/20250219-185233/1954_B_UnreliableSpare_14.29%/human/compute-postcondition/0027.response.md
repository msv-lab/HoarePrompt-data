Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value (which was Decimal('Infinity')) and `cnt` (which is 0).
- Since 0 is less than Decimal('Infinity'), `ans` is now 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `arr`, `i`, `n`, `flag`, `val`) remain unchanged.
