You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. Additionally, n is even, no arrows point outside the grid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()

            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `b[-2]` is not '>', `no_path` remains either True or False based on the initial conditions. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is 1, `no_path` remains either True or False based on the initial conditions. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` was initially True, it remains True. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` was initially False, `k` is updated to the last odd number less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if the second-to-last character in `b` is '>'. If it is not, the function prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the first row to the second row by examining the characters at even and odd indices in `a` and `b`. If all characters at even indices in `b` are '>' and all characters at odd indices in `a` are '>', the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n`, the first row `a`, and the second row `b`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (i.e., `b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`) and immediately prints `NO` if this condition is met. This is because if the robot is in the second row and the second-to-last cell is not pointing to the right, it cannot move to the last cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The program checks if `n` is 1 and prints `YES` if true. However, the problem description states that `n` is always at least 2, so this check is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness.

4. **Path Checking:**
   - The program then checks if there is a path from the starting cell `(1, 1)` to the target cell `(2, n)` by examining the arrows in the grid.
   - It first assumes that there is no path (`no_path = True`).
   - It then iterates over the cells in the second row at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). If any of these cells do not point to the right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it performs a similar check on the cells in the first row at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...). If any of these cells do not point to the right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, it prints `YES`, indicating that the robot can reach the target cell.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Issues:
- **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
  - This check is unnecessary and can be removed because the problem guarantees that `n` is at least 2.

- **Path Checking Logic:**
  - The logic for checking the path is flawed. The program assumes that if any cell in the second row at even indices or any cell in the first row at odd indices does not point to the right, then there is no path. However, this is not a valid assumption.
  - The robot can move in multiple directions (left, right, up, down) and can follow the arrows in the grid. The current logic does not account for the robot's ability to move up and down between rows, which is crucial for determining if a path exists.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for determining if the robot can reach the target cell is incorrect. It fails to consider the full range of movements the robot can make and the interactions between the arrows in the two rows.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
