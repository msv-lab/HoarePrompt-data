The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `length`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `length` is 30. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `length` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list that has been appended with either the string '1' or '0'. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2` (i.e., `x & 2`) results in a non-zero value, `s` contains the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains the string '0'.**
