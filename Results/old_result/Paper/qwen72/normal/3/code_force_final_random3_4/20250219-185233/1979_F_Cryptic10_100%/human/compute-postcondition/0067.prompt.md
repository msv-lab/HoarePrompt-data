Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus `v1` (and minus `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0). `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if `v2` <= 0. `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus `v1` (and minus `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0), `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if `v2` <= 0. `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, `vx` no longer contains `v1`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` <= 0, `v3` is removed from `vx`, and `ops` contains the new tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` and `int(input())` respectively, with `int(input())` being greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus the new `v1` and possibly minus `v3` if the new `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if the new `v2` > 0, or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if the new `v2` <= 0, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all new `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to the new `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all new `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to the new `v2`, `vx` no longer contains the new `v1` and must have more than 2 elements, and if the new `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
