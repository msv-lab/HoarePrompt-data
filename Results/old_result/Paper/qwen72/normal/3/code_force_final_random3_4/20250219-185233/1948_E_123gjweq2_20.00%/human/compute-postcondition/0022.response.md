Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right - 2`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.**

The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. The value of `clique` is a positive integer, and `left + mid + i` is an index in the `cliquess` array. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
