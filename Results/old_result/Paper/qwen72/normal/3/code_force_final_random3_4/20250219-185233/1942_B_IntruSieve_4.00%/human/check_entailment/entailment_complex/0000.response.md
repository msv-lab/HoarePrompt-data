Reasoning:

The task is to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the given array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program attempts to do this by maintaining two variables, `minn` and `maxx`, and a list `mex` to store the reconstructed permutation.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, which represents the smallest integer that has not been used in the permutation so far.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, which represents the largest integer that has been used in the permutation so far.
   - `mex` is an empty list that will store the reconstructed permutation.

2. **Processing the Array**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it means `p_i` should be the smallest unused integer (`minn`). This is because the MEX of the prefix up to `p_i` is greater than `p_i`, and the smallest unused integer is the MEX.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it means `p_i` should be the integer that, when subtracted from the MEX of the prefix up to `p_i`, gives `arr[i]`. This is calculated as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
     - After determining `p_i`, the program updates `minn` and `maxx` accordingly:
       - If `arr[i]` is positive, `minn` is incremented.
       - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value in `mex`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex` as the reconstructed permutation `p`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
  - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the prefix. The MEX of a prefix is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the prefix. The current logic does not ensure that `minn` is always the MEX of the prefix.
  - For example, if `arr[i]` is positive, the program simply appends `minn` and increments it. This does not account for the possibility that the MEX might be a different value if some integers are missing in the prefix.

- **Handling Non-Positive Values**:
  - The program calculates `p_i` for non-positive `arr[i]` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. This is incorrect because the MEX of the prefix is not necessarily `minn`, and the calculation does not ensure that the MEX is correctly determined.

- **Updating `maxx`**:
  - The program updates `maxx` to the maximum value in `mex`, but this is not necessary for the MEX calculation. The MEX is the smallest missing integer, not the largest used integer.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

Correctness: **False**
