The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three input integers, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. The conditions for `k` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.**
