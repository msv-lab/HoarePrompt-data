The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other states provided (n, m, a, s, and MOD) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
