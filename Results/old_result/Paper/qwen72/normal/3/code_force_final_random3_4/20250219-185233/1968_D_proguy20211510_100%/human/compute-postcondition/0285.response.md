Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`pres`**: This is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of the `paths` list.
2. **`resb`**: This is the maximum value of the cumulative sums `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= i + 1`.
3. **`ress`**: This is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`.
4. **`preb`**: This is the sum of all elements in the `pathb` list.
5. **`i`**: This is `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`.
6. **`paths`**: This list must have at least `min(k, len(paths))` elements.
7. **`curr`**: This is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(k, len(paths)) - 1] * (k - (min(k, len(paths)) - 1))`.
8. **`resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`**: This condition is given.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing a string literal `'Draw'`.
- The values of `pres`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `i`, `paths`, and `curr` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
- The condition `resb >= ress` is given, but it does not influence the `print` statement either.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Draw'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **Draw**
