The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `factors[prime]`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `factors[prime] + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes)
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element
- `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k] * primes[k]`
- `factor` is the next element in `rest`
- `factors[prime]` must be at least 0
- `_` is `factors[prime]`
- The value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `factors[prime]` must still be at least 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:

- `_` is `factors[prime] + 1`
- `factors[prime]` must be at least 0

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k] * primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is `factors[prime] + 1`**
