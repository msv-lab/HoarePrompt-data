Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`N` is the input integer, `i` is `N`, `s` is the index of the last occurrence of the last unique number in `nums` before `-1`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last integer in the list `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a segment in `nums` and the value of the segment, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it. If `ppp` is 23, the program retains all these conditions.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user. If `tc` is greater than 5, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `ppp` is equal to 23, the postcondition remains unchanged. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `s` is greater than `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `l`. If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`. If `e` is less than `r`, then `e` is less than `N` if `e` is less than `N`, or `e` is greater than or equal to `N` if `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user, `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order, `tc > 5`, and `ppp` is either 23 or not 23. If `s` > `l`, the values of `s` and `e` remain the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. If `s` â‰¤ `l`, the values of `s` and `e` also remain the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`l` and `r` are updated to the new input integers, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, `tc > 5`, `ppp` is either 23 or not 23, and `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `s > l`, the postconditions of the if part apply. If `s <= l` and `e >= r`, the postconditions of the if part apply. If `s <= l` and `e < r` and `e < N`, the postconditions of the if part apply. If `s <= l` and `e < r` and `e >= N`, the postconditions of the else part apply.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
