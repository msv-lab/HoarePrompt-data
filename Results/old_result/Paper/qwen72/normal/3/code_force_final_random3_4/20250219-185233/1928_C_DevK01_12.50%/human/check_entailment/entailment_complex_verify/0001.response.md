### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem describes a pattern where the numbers assigned to students in a line repeat every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The pattern is: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, \ldots\).
   - Vasya's position \(n\) and the number he received \(x\) are given.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \(k\) (where \(k > 1\)) fit the given constraints.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - For a given \(n\) and \(x\), \(k\) must satisfy the condition that the number at position \(n\) in the pattern is \(x\).

3. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The position \(n\) can be expressed as \(n = m \cdot (2k - 2) + p\), where \(m\) is the number of complete cycles and \(p\) is the position within the current cycle.
   - The number at position \(p\) in the cycle must be \(x\).
   - The cycle has two parts: the first \(k\) positions are \(1, 2, \ldots, k\) and the next \(k-2\) positions are \(k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2\).
   - Therefore, \(p\) can be either in the first part or the second part of the cycle.
   - If \(p \leq k\), then \(p = x\).
   - If \(p > k\), then \(p = 2k - x\).

4. **Solving for \(k\)**:
   - We need to find all \(k\) such that \(n = m \cdot (2k - 2) + p\) and \(p\) is either \(x\) or \(2k - x\).
   - This can be rewritten as \(n + x = m \cdot (2k - 2) + 2x\) or \(n + x = m \cdot (2k - 2) + 2k\).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 because \(y\) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calls `func_1` to find all divisors of \((y - 2) // 2\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It then checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and adds the results of `func_1` for \((n - x) // 2\) to the list of divisors.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates and prints the length of the list.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It checks if \(q\) is a perfect square and if the square root is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to \(\sqrt{q}\) and adds divisors that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).

7. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(y\) is odd.
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \((y - 2) // 2\) and \((n - x) // 2\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - The program correctly removes duplicates and counts the number of valid \(k\).

8. **Validation with Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case and applies the necessary conditions to determine the valid \(k\).
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and constraints provided in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. The annotated code and the original assessment are consistent and accurate.

Final: **True**
