Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1).
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement will always print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `eli`, `LA`, `s`, `e`, or `_`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement will be `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
