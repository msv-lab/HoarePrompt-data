Reasoning:

1. **Case 1: \( b \le a \)**
   - The program correctly identifies that if the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The profit is calculated as \( n \times a \), which is correct.
   - The program prints \( n \times a \).

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \ge n \)**
   - The program correctly identifies that if the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
   - The profit for selling the first \( n \) buns at modified prices is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (b - i + 1) \).
   - This sum can be simplified to \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - The program prints \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \), which is correct.

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**
   - The program correctly identifies that if the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is less than the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal to sell the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at the usual price.
   - The profit for selling the first \( b - a \) buns at modified prices is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \sum_{i=1}^{b-a} (b - i + 1) \).
   - This sum can be simplified to \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} \).
   - The profit for selling the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at the usual price is \( (n - (b - a)) \times a \).
   - The total profit is \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a)) \).
   - However, the program prints \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \), which is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a)) \).

The error in the third case is significant because it affects the calculation of the profit for the remaining buns. The program should subtract the number of buns sold at the modified price from the total number of buns before multiplying by the usual price.

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the error in the third case where the profit for the remaining buns is not calculated correctly. The correct formula should be \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a)) \).
