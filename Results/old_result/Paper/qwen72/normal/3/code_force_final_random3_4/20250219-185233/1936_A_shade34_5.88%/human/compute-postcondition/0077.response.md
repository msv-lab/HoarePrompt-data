Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
   - `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements (though the exact contents of `pans` are not relevant to the print statement).
   - `mak` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is a detail about the environment, not directly affecting the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first element in the print statement is a string literal `'?'`.
   - The second element is the variable `mak`, which is 0.
   - The third element is the variable `mak` again, which is also 0.
   - The fourth element is the variable `i`, which is 1.
   - The fifth element is the variable `i` again, which is also 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will concatenate these elements with spaces in between.
   - Therefore, it will print: `? 0 0 1 1`.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
