The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(3, n + 1):` will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 3, meaning `n` must be at least 3. However, the initial state provided is `i` is `n + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop. To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be set to 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3**
