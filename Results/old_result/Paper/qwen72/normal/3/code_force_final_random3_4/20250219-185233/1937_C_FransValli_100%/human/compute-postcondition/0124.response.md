Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.
   - `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order.
   - `item` is `n-2`.
   - `res` is an input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is set to `n-1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mini` is set to `n-1` if `res` is '>'.
   - `item` is `n-2`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string that starts with '?', followed by the value of `mini` twice, then the value of `item` twice.
   - Since `mini` is `n-1` and `item` is `n-2`, the output will be:
     - `?`, followed by `n-1`, followed by `n-1`, followed by `n-2`, followed by `n-2`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the following:
     - `?`, `n-1`, `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-2`.

Output: **? [n-1] [n-1] [n-2] [n-2] (where n is greater than 1)**
