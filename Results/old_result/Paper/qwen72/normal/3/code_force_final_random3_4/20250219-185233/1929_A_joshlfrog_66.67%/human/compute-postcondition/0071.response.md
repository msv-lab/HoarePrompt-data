Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is a new input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 2, `e` remains 2, `l` is the input integer that determines the length of the list `nums`, `i` is set to `l-1` (the last index of the list), `nums` is still the list of integers provided by the user, `x` is updated to the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and `y` is updated to the minimum value found in the list `nums`.
