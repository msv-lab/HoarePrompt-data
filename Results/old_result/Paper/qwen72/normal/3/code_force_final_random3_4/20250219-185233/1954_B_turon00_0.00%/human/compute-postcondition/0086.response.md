Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `_` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- The variable `tmp` remains unchanged as it is set to the first element of the list `a` before the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- The set `aa` remains unchanged as it is created from the unique elements of the list `a` before the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a` after the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found at the end of the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the entire loop execution. If no consecutive elements equal to `tmp` were found, `ans` will be 0. Otherwise, it will be the smallest count of such consecutive elements.
