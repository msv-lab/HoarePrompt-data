The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, the loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the integer input provided by the user. The variable `_` is used as a counter to track the number of iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `m`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0.**
