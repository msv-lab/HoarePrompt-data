Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 0, and `best_y` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `gcd_val` is updated to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. Since `y` is `x - 1`, and `x` and `x - 1` are consecutive integers, their greatest common divisor is always 1.
- `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + 1`, which is 1 + 1 = 2.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
