The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` to `arr`. Given that `i` is 3, `arr` will be `[3]`. The values of `n` and `res` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string. If the new `res` is '<', `arr` is [3]. If the new `res` is '=', `arr` is [3]. Otherwise, `arr` is [3].**
