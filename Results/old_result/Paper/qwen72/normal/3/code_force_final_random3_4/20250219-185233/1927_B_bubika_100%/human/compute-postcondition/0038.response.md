Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**: This is a string containing all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet in order.
2. **`t` is 1**: This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so it's not relevant to our task.
3. **`b` is a list of 26 zeros with the elements at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` incremented by 1**: This means `b` is a list of 26 zeros, and for each integer in the list `s`, the corresponding index in `b` is incremented by 1. However, `b` is not used in the `print` statement, so it's not relevant to our task.
4. **`n` is an input integer greater than 1**: This is the number of integers in the list `s`, but it's not directly used in the `print` statement.
5. **`s` is a list of integers input by the user**: This list contains integers that are indices into the string `a`.
6. **`r` is a string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the integers in `s`, in the order they appear in `s`**: This means `r` is constructed by taking the characters from `a` at the positions specified by the integers in `s` and concatenating them in the same order.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(r)
```

### Explanation:
- The string `r` is constructed by taking the characters from `a` at the positions specified by the integers in `s`.
- For example, if `s = [0, 4, 19]`, then `r` would be constructed as follows:
  - `a[0]` is 'a'
  - `a[4]` is 'e'
  - `a[19]` is 't'
  - Therefore, `r` would be 'aet'.

### Output:
Output: **r (where r is a string containing the characters from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' at the indices specified by the integers in the list s, in the order they appear in s)**

This output describes the string `r` based on the given initial state and the construction of `r` from the indices in `s`.
