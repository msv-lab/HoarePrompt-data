Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly determine the winner for all possible inputs. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Bob
```

In this test case, Alice can win by choosing \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, which will leave the piles as \( [0, 1, 2] \). Bob will then be forced to choose \( k = 1 \), leaving the piles as \( [0, 0, 1] \). Alice can then choose \( k = 1 \) again, emptying the last pile and winning the game. However, the program incorrectly returns "Bob" as the winner. This indicates that the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly handle all potential game states.
