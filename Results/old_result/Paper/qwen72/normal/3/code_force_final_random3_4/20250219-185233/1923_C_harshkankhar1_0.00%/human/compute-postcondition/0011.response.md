Initial State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`.

Given the code:
```
b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `i` is 3.
2. `b[i]` is `b[3]`.
3. `b[i - 1]` is `b[2]`.
4. `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
5. `b[3]` is assigned the value of `b[2] + x`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`, `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`.**
