Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line contains three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. This matches the problem description.

2. **Test Case Loop**: The program iterates over each test case using a list comprehension to read the lines from standard input. This is a valid approach to handle multiple test cases.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**:
     - If `x` is less than `k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - This is based on the idea that Sasha can place bets such that he can recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have at least one coin left to place another bet. If `a >= x + 1`, he can always place a bet of 1 coin and recover from `x` losses, ensuring he can continue betting and eventually win more coins.
   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**:
     - If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`.
     - This condition is slightly more stringent because Sasha needs to have enough coins to place a bet after `x` consecutive losses and still have at least one coin left to place another bet. If `a >= x + 2`, he can place a bet of 1 coin and recover from `x` losses, ensuring he can continue betting and eventually win more coins.
   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**:
     - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, the program calculates a value `z` using a loop.
     - The loop iterates `x - k + 3` times, and in each iteration, it updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - The purpose of this loop is to determine the minimum number of coins `z` that Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to place another bet. The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to simulate the process of placing bets and recovering from losses.
     - If `a >= z`, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can achieve the desired outcome. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `k - 1`.
   - The loop for calculating `z` is designed to handle the scenario where `x` is significantly larger than `k - 1`.

6. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the minimum number of coins `z` in the case where `x > k - 1` is based on the idea that Sasha can place bets in a way that ensures he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - The conditions for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` are also logically sound and match the problem's constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
