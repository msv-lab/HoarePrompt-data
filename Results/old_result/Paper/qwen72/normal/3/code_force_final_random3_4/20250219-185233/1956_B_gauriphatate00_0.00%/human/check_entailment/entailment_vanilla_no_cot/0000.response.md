Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting the number of pairs of cards you have.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card number in your hand.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs by summing up the counts where a card number appears exactly twice.
   - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` because you can only score points for up to `n // 2` pairs, as Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes the index `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of card numbers `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case and appends it to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic in both functions aligns with the problem requirements, and the program correctly handles the input and output format. Therefore, the program is correct.
