Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
2. `arr` is a list of integers.
3. The sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.
4. `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0.
5. `flag` is False.
6. `val` is the first element of `arr`.
7. `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val` before encountering a different element, or `n` if all elements are equal to `val`.
8. `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`n` and `i`**:
   - `n` is the length of `arr`, and it must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in `arr`.

2. **`val`**:
   - `val` is the first element of `arr`.

3. **`cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val`.
   - If all elements in `arr` are equal to `val`, then `cnt` will be `n`.

4. **`ans`**:
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
   - The previous `ans` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is initialized to some value before this snippet is executed.

### Output Determination:
- The value of `ans` is determined by the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
- `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val`.
- Since `cnt` is a count of consecutive elements, it will be a positive integer (at least 1, because the first element is always equal to itself).

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value between the previous ans and cnt, and cnt is the number of consecutive elements from the start of arr that are equal to val)**
