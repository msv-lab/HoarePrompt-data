Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` assigns the value `big_element - i` to the element in the array at the index `left + mid + i`.
- Given that `i` is 0, the index in the array is `left + mid + 0`, which simplifies to `left + mid`.
- The value being assigned is `big_element - i`, which simplifies to `big_element` since `i` is 0.
- Since `big_element` is `right + 1`, the value assigned to `arr[left + mid]` is `right + 1`.
- The states of the other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
