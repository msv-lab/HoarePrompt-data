The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which already ensures that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

However, for the loop to start, `_` should be initialized to 0 (the first iteration of the loop). 

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
