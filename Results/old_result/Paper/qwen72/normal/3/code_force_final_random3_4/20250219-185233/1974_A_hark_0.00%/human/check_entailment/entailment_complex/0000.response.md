Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is a simple implementation of a minimum function. It returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`. This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
     - It then updates `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This step seems to be intended to account for the space taken by 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons. However, this formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the space taken by 2x2 icons. The correct formula should be `x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so `15 - 4 = 11` cells remain for 1x1 icons after placing one 2x2 icon.
     - It then calculates `bxsfory1` as 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise as `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. The `+ 1` is unnecessary and incorrect because it overestimates the number of screens needed.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is correct.
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is correct.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0, which is correct.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_2` exactly `t` times, which is correct according to the problem description.

Given the issues in `func_2`:
- The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x - bxsfory * 11` to properly account for the space taken by 2x2 icons.
- The calculation of `bxsfory1` should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` without the `+ 1`.

These issues will lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
