Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Function Call and Definition Mismatch**: The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop that processes each test case, but the function definition itself is not indented to be part of the loop. This means that `func_1()` is only defined after all test cases have been processed, which will result in a `NameError` because `func_1()` is called before it is defined.

2. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` redefines `input` to be `sys.stdin.readline`, which is not necessary and can cause issues. Instead, you should use `sys.stdin.readline` directly or define a new variable to hold the function.

3. **Logic for Finding Pairs**: The logic for finding pairs of indices with different elements within the query range is flawed. The program tries to find the first and last occurrence of a number in the array and then checks if these occurrences are within the query range. However, this approach does not correctly handle all cases, especially when the array contains multiple distinct elements within the query range.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the query range might not contain any distinct elements. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 1, 1]` and the query is `(1, 4)`, the program should output `(-1, -1)`, but it might not do so correctly.

5. **Appending `-1` to `nums`**: Appending `-1` to the `nums` array is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results if the query range includes the last element of the array.

6. **Bisect Usage**: The use of `bisect_left` is not appropriate for this problem. `bisect_left` is used to find the insertion point for a value in a sorted list, but the list `arr` is not sorted in a way that `bisect_left` can be used effectively.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def find_distinct_pair(nums, l, r):
    for i in range(l-1, r):
        for j in range(i+1, r):
            if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                return i+1, j+1
    return -1, -1

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        i, j = find_distinct_pair(nums, l, r)
        print(i, j)
```

This corrected version uses a simple nested loop to find the first pair of distinct elements within the query range. It is more straightforward and ensures that the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
