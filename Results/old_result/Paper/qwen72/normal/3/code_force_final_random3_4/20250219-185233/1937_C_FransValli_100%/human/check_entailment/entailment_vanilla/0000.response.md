### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Index:**
   - The program initializes `maxi` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it asks a query `? maxi maxi i i`.
   - The response from the interactor is used to update `maxi` if `p_i` is greater than `p_maxi` (i.e., if the response is `<`).

3. **Finding the Candidate Indices:**
   - The program initializes an array `arr` with the first element as 0.
   - It then iterates over the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it asks a query `? maxi arr[0] maxi i`.
   - The response from the interactor is used to update `arr`:
     - If `p_i` is greater than `p_arr[0]`, `arr` is set to `[i]`.
     - If `p_i` is equal to `p_arr[0]`, `i` is appended to `arr`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Index Among Candidates:**
   - The program initializes `mini` to the first element of `arr`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `arr`.
   - For each element `item`, it asks a query `? mini mini item item`.
   - The response from the interactor is used to update `mini` if `p_item` is less than `p_mini` (i.e., if the response is `>`).

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the pair that maximizes `p_i \oplus p_j`.

### Analysis:

- **Query Efficiency:**
  - The first loop makes `n-1` queries to find `maxi`.
  - The second loop makes `n-1` queries to find the candidate indices.
  - The third loop makes at most `n-1` queries to find `mini` among the candidates.
  - Therefore, the total number of queries is at most `3n - 3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

- **Correctness:**
  - The first loop ensures that `maxi` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.
  - The second loop ensures that `arr` contains all indices `i` such that `p_i` is equal to `p_maxi`.
  - The third loop ensures that `mini` is the index of the minimum value among the candidates in `arr`.
  - The pair `(maxi, mini)` is then outputted, which should maximize `p_i \oplus p_j` because `p_maxi` is the maximum value and `p_mini` is the minimum value among the candidates.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's constraints and logic to find a pair of indices that maximizes the bitwise XOR operation, using at most `3n` queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
