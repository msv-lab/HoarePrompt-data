Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on spaces, and converts each string to an integer, storing the result in the list `w`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
