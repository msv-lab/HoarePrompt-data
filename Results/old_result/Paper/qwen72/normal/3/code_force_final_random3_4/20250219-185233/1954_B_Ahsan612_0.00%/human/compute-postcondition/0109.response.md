Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least four elements, `i` is 5, `len(ar)` is greater than 4. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `same` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1. `num` is the sixth element of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of 1 and `same`.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value (1) and the value of `same`.
- If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `same` is 2 or 3, so `minn` remains 1.
- If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar`, `same` is 1, so `minn` remains 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
