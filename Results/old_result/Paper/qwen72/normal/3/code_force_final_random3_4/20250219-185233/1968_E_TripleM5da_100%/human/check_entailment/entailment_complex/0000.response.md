Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program's strategy is to print the following points for each test case:
1. The point \((1, 1)\)
2. The point \((1, 2)\)
3. For each \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), the point \((i, i)\)

Let's analyze the correctness of this strategy:

1. **Initial Points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\)**:
   - The Manhattan distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) is \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - This ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains at least the distance 1.

2. **Points \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\)**:
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) where \(3 \le i < j \le n\) is \(|i-j| + |i-j| = 2|j-i|\).
   - Since \(i\) and \(j\) are distinct integers from 3 to \(n\), the distances \(2|j-i|\) will be distinct for each pair \((i, j)\).

3. **Distances Involving \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\)**:
   - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((i, i)\) for \(3 \le i \le n\) is \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2|i-1|\).
   - The distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((i, i)\) for \(3 \le i \le n\) is \(|1-i| + |2-i| = |1-i| + |i-2| = |1-i| + |i-2| = 2|i-1.5|\).

4. **Combining All Distances**:
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain:
     - The distance 1 (from \((1, 1)\) to \((1, 2)\)).
     - Distances of the form \(2|j-i|\) for \(3 \le i < j \le n\).
     - Distances of the form \(2|i-1|\) for \(3 \le i \le n\).
     - Distances of the form \(2|i-1.5|\) for \(3 \le i \le n\).

However, this strategy does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For example, consider \(n = 4\):
- The program prints: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\).
- The distances are:
  - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
  - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
  - \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
  - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - \(|1-3| + |1-2| = 3\)
  - \(|1-4| + |1-2| = 5\)
  - \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)
  - \(|3-4| + |3-4| = 2\)
  - \(|3-3| + |3-2| = 1\)
  - \(|4-4| + |4-2| = 2\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has 7 elements. However, a better arrangement for \(n = 4\) could be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), which yields a set \(\mathcal{H}\) with 9 elements.

Therefore, the program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
