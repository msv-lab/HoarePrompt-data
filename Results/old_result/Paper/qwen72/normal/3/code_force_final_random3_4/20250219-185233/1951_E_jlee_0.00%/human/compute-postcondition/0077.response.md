Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if any of the following conditions are met: `count2` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than `count`, `count2` is equal to `count` (regardless of the value of `count`), or `count2` is greater than `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1, and the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to `x`.***
