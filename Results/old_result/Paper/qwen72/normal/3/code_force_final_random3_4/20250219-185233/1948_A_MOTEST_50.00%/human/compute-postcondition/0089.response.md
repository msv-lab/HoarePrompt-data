Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and is at least 7 (not divisible by 2), `ans` is 'AAABBBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 1**

The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` (which is 'C') twice to the string `ans`. Initially, `ans` is 'AAABBB', so after the execution, `ans` becomes 'AAABBBCC'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
