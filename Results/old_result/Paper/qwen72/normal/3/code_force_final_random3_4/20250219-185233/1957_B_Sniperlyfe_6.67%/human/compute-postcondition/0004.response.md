The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
- `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element (`nums[0]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements initialized to 0
- `k` is now \(k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\)

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1
- `n` must still be greater than 0, and since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element (`nums[0]`) set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements initialized to 0, `k` is now \(k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\)**
