Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
