Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to produce a string of uppercase Latin letters. Instead, it generates a string of '1's and '0's, which are not uppercase Latin letters. For example, for `n = 6`, the program outputs `110110110110`, which is not a valid string as per the problem description. The program should generate a string like `AAABAACC` instead.
