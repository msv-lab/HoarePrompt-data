Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first element of the list resulting from `input().split()` if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` remains an empty list. `card` is the first element of the list resulting from `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `suits` remains a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`. If `suit` is not equal to `trump` and `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` contains a single string which is the concatenation of the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list and the value for the key `suit` in `suits` is set to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `rank`, and `suit` remain unchanged. If `suit` is equal to `trump_suit`, `trumps` now includes `rank` as its last element. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` has a new element appended, which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of the previous `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, followed by `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is now `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, and `card` remain unchanged; `rank` is the rank of the next card in the list, `suit` is the suit of the next card in the list. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` now includes the value of `rank` as the last element. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` has a new element appended which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each, separated by a space, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
