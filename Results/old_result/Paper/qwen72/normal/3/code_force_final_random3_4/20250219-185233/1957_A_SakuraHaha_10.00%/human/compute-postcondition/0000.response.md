Output State: **The function should take a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. Each test case list should be structured as [n, [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]], with 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100. `n` is an input integer.**
