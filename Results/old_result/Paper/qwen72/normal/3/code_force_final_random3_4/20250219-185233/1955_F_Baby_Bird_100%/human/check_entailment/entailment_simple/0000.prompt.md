Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each of the four integers p_i in the sequence is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: - The result of the formula for each test case is printed on a new line.
    #
    #### Detailed Calculation:
    #- For each integer \(x\) in the sequence:
    #  - If \(x\) is even, `x % 2` is 0, so the formula simplifies to:
    #    \[
    #    3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \right)
    #    \]
    #  - If \(x\) is odd, `x % 2` is 1, so the formula becomes:
    #    \[
    #    3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 1 \cdot (i < 3)
    #    \]
    #    - This means for \(i < 3\), an additional 1 is added to the sum if \(x\) is odd.
    #    - For \(i = 3\), no additional 1 is added.
    #
    #- The sum of these values for all four integers in the sequence is then divided by 3 using integer division.
    #
    #### Example Calculation:
    #- Suppose the input is:
    #  - `t = 2`
    #  - For the first test case: `p_0 = 4, p_1 = 5, p_2 = 6, p_3 = 7`
    #  - For the second test case: `p_0 = 0, p_1 = 1, p_2 = 2, p_3 = 3`
    #
    #- For the first test case:
    #  - \(p_0 = 4\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 2 + 0 = 6\)
    #  - \(p_1 = 5\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{5}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 1 = 3 \cdot 2 + 1 = 7\)
    #  - \(p_2 = 6\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{6}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 3 + 0 = 9\)
    #  - \(p_3 = 7\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{7}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 3 + 0 = 9\)
    #  - Sum: \(6 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 31\)
    #  - Result: \(31 // 3 = 10\)
    #
    #- For the second test case:
    #  - \(p_0 = 0\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 0 + 0 = 0\)
    #  - \(p_1 = 1\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 1 = 3 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1\)
    #  - \(p_2 = 2\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 1 + 0 = 3\)
    #  - \(p_3 = 3\): \(3 \left(\left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + 0 = 3 \cdot 1 + 0 = 3\)
    #  - Sum: \(0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7\)
    #  - Result: \(7 // 3 = 2\)
    #
    #### Final Output:
    #- The code will print the results of the formula for each test case, one result per line.
