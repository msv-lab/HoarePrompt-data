Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user for each iteration. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` at the end of the loop are the values provided in the last iteration.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop have completed, the value of `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 for each iteration.
- The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values from the last iteration.
- The conditions inside the loop (whether `b` is less than or equal to `a`, or the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or less than `n`) do not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` directly. They only determine the output printed during each iteration.
