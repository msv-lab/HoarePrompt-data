Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n_cases` is greater than 1.
   - `n` must be greater than \(2^{(\text{power}-1)}\).
   - `power` is one less than the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).
   - `power` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `power` is defined as one less than the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). This means `power` is the exponent of 2 that gives the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 5 is \(2^3 = 8\). Therefore, `power` would be 3 - 1 = 2.
   - The condition `n` must be greater than \(2^{(\text{power}-1)}\) ensures that `n` is between \(2^{(\text{power}-1)}\) and \(2^{\text{power}}\).

3. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - This will print the value of \(2^{\text{power}}\).

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - Given the initial state, `power` is the exponent such that \(2^{\text{power}}\) is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, the value printed will be \(2^{\text{power}}\).

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `power` or \(2^{\text{power}}\). However, based on the given conditions, we can describe the output precisely.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is one less than the smallest integer such that 2^power >= n)**
