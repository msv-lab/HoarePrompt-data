To determine what will be printed by the `print(3)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `i` is initialized to `n`.
- `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user.
- `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged (though they are not used in the given code snippet).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(3)
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `v`**:
   - The list `v` has a length of `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `v` is 0.
   - The remaining elements are integers provided by the user.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i`**:
   - The code snippet does not include the loop or the condition check, but based on the initial state, we know that if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` at any iteration, the program prints 2 and returns.
   - If this condition is never met, the program completes the loop and returns nothing.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(3)` statement is outside the loop and condition check.
   - It will execute after the loop has completed, assuming the loop does not return early due to the condition being met.

### Conclusion:
- Since the `print(3)` statement is outside the loop and condition check, it will always be executed unless the program returns early due to the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` being met.
- However, the given code snippet only includes the `print(3)` statement, and there is no indication that the condition was met or the loop was executed.

Therefore, the `print(3)` statement will always print the integer 3.

Output: **3**
