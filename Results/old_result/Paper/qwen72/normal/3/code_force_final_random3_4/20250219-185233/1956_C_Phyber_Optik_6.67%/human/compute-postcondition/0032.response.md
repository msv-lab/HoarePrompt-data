Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `i` is set to `n`.
4. `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`).
5. `j` is set to 2.
6. If `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, the condition `j <= n + r` holds.
7. If `j` is greater than `n + r`, the condition `j > n + r` holds.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: `i` is set to `n`.
2. **Value of `r`**: `r` is determined by the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. Since `i` is `n`, the condition becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`. Simplifying this:
   - `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - `n * n` is `n` squared.
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n` simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n^2`.
   - This can be further simplified to `n + 1 > 2n`, or `1 > n`, which is always false for `n > 0`.
   - Therefore, `r` will be `n` because the condition does not hold for any `i` from 1 to `n`.

3. **Value of `j`**: `j` is set to 2.
4. **Condition `j <= n + r`**:
   - Since `r` is `n`, the condition becomes `j <= n + n`, or `j <= 2n`.
   - Given that `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0, `2 <= 2n` is always true for any positive `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Output Determination:
- The `print` statement will print the values 1 and `j` (which is 2), followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2**
