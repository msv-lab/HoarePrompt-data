Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end.** 

The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a heap (min-heap) in-place, but it does not change the values of any other variables. The heap is now organized such that the smallest element is at the root, and the heap property is maintained.
