Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the sublist `S[1]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the sublist `S[1]`, `rsum` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is either -1, 0, or 1. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to 1. If `abs(n / 2 - i) >= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, `ans` remains either -1 or 0.***
