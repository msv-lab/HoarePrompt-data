Output State: **`i` is 1, `paths` must have at least two elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, and `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 1.
- `paths` still has at least two elements.
- `curr` is updated to `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`.
- `pres` remains `pres + paths[0]`.
- `ress` remains the maximum of the previous `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * k`.
- If `k` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
