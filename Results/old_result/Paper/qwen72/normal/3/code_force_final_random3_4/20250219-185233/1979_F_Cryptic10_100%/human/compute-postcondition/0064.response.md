Output State: **`v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus the new `v1` and minus `v3`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if the new `v2` > 0, or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if the new `v2` <= 0, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all new `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to the new `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all new `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to the new `v2`, `vx` no longer contains the new `v1` and must have more than 2 elements, and `v3` has been removed from `vx`.**
