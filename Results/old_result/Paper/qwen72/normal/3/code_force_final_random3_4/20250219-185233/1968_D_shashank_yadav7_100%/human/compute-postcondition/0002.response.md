Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `t` and `i`. The code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` respectively. Therefore, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are now input integers.
