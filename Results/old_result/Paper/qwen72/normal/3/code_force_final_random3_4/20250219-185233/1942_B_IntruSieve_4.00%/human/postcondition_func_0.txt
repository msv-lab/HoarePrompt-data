The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n` from the user. It processes the array to generate a list `mex` of integers. For each element in `a`, if the element is positive, it appends the current value of `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If the element is non-positive, it appends the absolute difference between the element and `minn` to `mex`. After processing all elements, it prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by an empty line. The function does not return any value.
