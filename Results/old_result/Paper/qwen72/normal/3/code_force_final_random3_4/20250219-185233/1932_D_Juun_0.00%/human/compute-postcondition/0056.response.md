Postcondition: ***`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one more value is not `None` (excluding the one already processed). If `trumps` is not empty, `trumps` is one element shorter, and `answers` is updated with a new string in the format `'rank suit trumpSuit trumpRank'`. If `rank` was `None`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.***
