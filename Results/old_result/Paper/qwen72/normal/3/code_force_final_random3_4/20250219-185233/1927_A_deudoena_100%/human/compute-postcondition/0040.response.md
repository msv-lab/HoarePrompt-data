The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each tuple in the list `test_cases` contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string. The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' character and the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s` (both 1-indexed), plus 2.
