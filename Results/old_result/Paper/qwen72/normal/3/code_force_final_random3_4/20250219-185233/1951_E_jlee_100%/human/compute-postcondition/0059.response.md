Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count2` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `done` remains False.
   - The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `count2` is equal to `count`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `string[:j - 1]` means slicing the string from the start to the character before index `j - 1`. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, slicing with a negative index means counting from the end of the string. However, `string[:j - 1]` will result in an empty string because there are no characters before the last character.
   - `string[j - 1:]` means slicing the string from the character at index `j - 1` to the end. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1, which refers to the last character of the string. Therefore, `string[j - 1:]` will include the last character and everything after it, which is just the last character.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The first part of the print statement, `string[:j - 1]`, will print an empty string.
   - The second part of the print statement, `string[j - 1:]`, will print the last character of the string.

Output: **'', last character of `string`**
