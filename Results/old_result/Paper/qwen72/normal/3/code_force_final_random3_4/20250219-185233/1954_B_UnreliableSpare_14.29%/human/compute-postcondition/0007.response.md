Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If `arr[1]` is not equal to `arr[0]`, `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains True.***
