The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` is the new value (previous value + 1).
- `t` must be greater than this new value of `_`.

State: **`func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `3 + n + n`. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than the new value of `_`. `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1 - n]`. `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx - n` in `data`. `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`. `_` is incremented by 1.**
