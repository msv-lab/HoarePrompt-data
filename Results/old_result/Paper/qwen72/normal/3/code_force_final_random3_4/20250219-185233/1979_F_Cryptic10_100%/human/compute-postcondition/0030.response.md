Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers removed from `vx` during the loop execution, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`, and `p2` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `p1` is assigned the value of `list(vx)`, which converts the set `vx` into a list containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`.
- `p2` is assigned an empty list `[]`.
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `vx`, and `ops` remain unchanged.
