Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits are equal. According to the problem description, if all three digits are the same (e.g., `a = b = c`), the output should be "NONE". However, the current program will incorrectly output "STAIRS" if `a < b < c` and "PEAK" if `a < b > c`. For example, if the input is `1 1 1`, the program will output "STAIRS" instead of "NONE".
