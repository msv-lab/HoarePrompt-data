The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. For the problem to be correctly addressed, the function should accept parameters `t` (number of test cases), `n` (size of the array for each test case), and `a` (the array of integers for each test case), where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with each element `a_i` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2·10^5.
