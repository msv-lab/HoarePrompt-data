The code snippet `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains three elements: the value of `1 + s`, the value of `i` which is 0, and the value of `num`. The initial state specifies that `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, and the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`.

Since `i` is 0 and `num` retains its value, the tuple appended to `arr` will be `(1 + s, 0, num)`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)` at the end.**
