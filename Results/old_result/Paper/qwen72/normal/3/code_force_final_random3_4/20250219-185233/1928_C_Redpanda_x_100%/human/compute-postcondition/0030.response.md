Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factor` is the next element in `rest`**

The value of `prime_to_i` is reset to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `k` is still a non-negative integer within the specified range, `rest` is still the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is still equal to `primes[k]`, and `factor` is still the next element in `rest`.
