Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was `inf`, then `minn` is now `same`. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `ar`.
- The length of `ar` is now the number of integers provided in the input, and `ar` contains at least 2 elements as per the precondition.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `same`, and `minn` remain unchanged, except that `ar` is now updated to the new list of integers provided by the input.
- The precondition that `i` is equal to the length of `ar` is still valid after the code execution.
- The precondition that `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar` is still valid, but `ar` has been updated, so `same` would need to be recalculated based on the new `ar`.
- The precondition that `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` is still valid, but `ar` has been updated, so `minn` would need to be recalculated based on the new `ar` and the updated `same`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `ar` and maintains the other preconditions.
