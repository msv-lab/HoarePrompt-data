Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. **`l` and `r` are updated to new input integers**: This means that `l` and `r` are some integers provided as input.
2. **`s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`**: This means that `s` and `e` are derived from a tuple in the list `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
3. **`tc > 5`**: This indicates that `tc` is a variable with a value greater than 5.
4. **`ppp` is either 23 or not 23**: This means `ppp` can be any integer, but it is specifically noted that it can be 23 or not 23.
5. **`eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order**: This means `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would fit in the list `arr` to keep it sorted.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing two constants: `-1` and `-1`.
- The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, `tc`, `ppp`, and `eli` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1, -1**
