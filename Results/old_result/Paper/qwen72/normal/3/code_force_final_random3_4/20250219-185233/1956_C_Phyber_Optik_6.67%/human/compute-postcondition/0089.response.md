The code snippet `sum, r = 0, 0` reassigns the values of `sum` and `r` to 0. This overrides their previous values. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is 0, and `sum` is 0.**
