Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `rep` is 60 or less.
- `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`.
- `k` is 0.
- `t` is 0 or a positive integer.
- `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration.
- `i` is `None`.
- `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
- `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed.

### Analysis:
1. **`k` is 0**: This is a critical piece of information. Since `k` is 0, any division involving `k` (like `n // k`) will result in a **ZeroDivisionError** unless `n` is also 0. However, the initial state specifies that `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`. Since `k` is 0, `n` must be 0 to avoid a division by zero error.

2. **`n` is 0**: Given that `n` is 0, the expression `n // k` will not be computed because it would result in a division by zero. Therefore, `Min` and `Max` will not be computed in the usual sense. However, the initial state specifies that `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively. Since `n` is 0 and `k` is 0, `Min` and `Max` will be 0 and 0 respectively.

3. **`tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration**: The initial state does not specify how many iterations occur or what `number` is. However, it implies that `tab` is a list that is populated during some iterations. Since the initial state does not provide the number of iterations or the value of `number`, we cannot determine the exact length of `tab`.

4. **`i` is `None`**: This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.

5. **`n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed**: Given that `Min` and `Max` are both 0, `Min * Max` will be 0. Therefore, subtracting 0 from `n` will not change its value. Since `n` is initially 0, it will remain 0 after all subtractions.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the length of the list `tab`. Since the initial state does not provide the number of iterations or the value of `number`, we cannot determine the exact length of `tab`. However, we can describe it based on the given information.

Output: **len(tab) (where `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration, and the number of iterations is not specified)**
