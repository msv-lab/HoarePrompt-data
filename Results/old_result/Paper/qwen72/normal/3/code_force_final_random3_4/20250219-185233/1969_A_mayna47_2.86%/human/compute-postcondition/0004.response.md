The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the integer `2`.

Let's break down the initial state:
- The function definition `def func_1(t, test_cases):` is mentioned but not relevant to the `print` statement.
- The variable `n` is an input integer and its current value is 2.
- The variable `v` is a list of length `n + 1`, which is 3. The first element of `v` is 0, and the remaining two elements are integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t` and `test_cases` are not affected and are not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement itself:
```
print(2)
```
This statement prints the integer `2`.

Since the `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state, it will simply print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
