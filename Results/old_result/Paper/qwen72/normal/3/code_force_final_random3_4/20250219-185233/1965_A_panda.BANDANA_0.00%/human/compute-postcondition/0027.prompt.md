Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function should be able to process an input `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    e = set(l)
    m = len(l)
    if 1 in l:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements of `l`, `m` is the length of `l`. If 1 is in `l`, the list `l` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements of `l`, and `m` is the length of `l`. If 1 is in `l`, the set `e` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in `e`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements of `l`, and `m` is the length of `l`. If 1 is in `l`, the set `e` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in `e`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
