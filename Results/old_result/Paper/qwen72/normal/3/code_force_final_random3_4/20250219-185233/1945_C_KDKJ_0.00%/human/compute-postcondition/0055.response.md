Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is equal to `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`. If neither condition is true, `ans` is set to 2 if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the original value of `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
