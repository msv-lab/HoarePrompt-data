To determine what will be printed by the `print(itm, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`).
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `arr` is the list of integers input by the user.
   - `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(itm, end=' ')`.
   - The variable `itm` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely that `itm` is an element of the `mex` list, given that `mex` is a list of integers and must have at least one element.

Since `itm` is not explicitly defined, we need to infer its value based on the context. The most reasonable assumption is that `itm` is an element of the `mex` list. Given that `mex` must have at least one element, we can assume `itm` is the first element of `mex` (or any other element, but for simplicity, we will consider the first element).

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print(itm, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `itm` followed by a space.

Therefore, the output will be the value of the first element of the `mex` list followed by a space.

Output: **[first element of mex] (where [first element of mex] is the first element of the list `mex`)**
