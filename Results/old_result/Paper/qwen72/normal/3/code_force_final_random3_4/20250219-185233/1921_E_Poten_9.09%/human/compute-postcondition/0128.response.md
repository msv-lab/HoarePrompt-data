Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` has a new element 'Draw' appended to it. Otherwise, `answers` is a list that now contains the string 'Bob'.***
