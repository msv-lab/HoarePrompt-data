Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the MEX operation as described in the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations, but it does not actually compute the MEX of the subarray and apply the operation as required. Instead, it seems to be trying to maximize the sum through a different approach, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Additionally, the function `make_stairs` is designed to transform a subarray into a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. It assumes that the subarray can be transformed into a sequence of integers from 0 to `i` by setting all elements to `i`, which is not always the correct MEX value.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
0 2 1 3
```
The correct output should be:
```
10 1
1 4
```
This is because the MEX of the entire array is 4, and setting all elements to 4 results in the maximum sum of 16. However, the provided program does not correctly compute this and will likely produce an incorrect result.
