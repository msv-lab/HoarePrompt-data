### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` with zeros. This list will be used to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program iterates over the elements of `a` and increments the corresponding index in `cntl` to count how many times each integer appears in `a`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is zero. If it is, it prints `0` because the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` is `0`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not zero, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of `2` and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most one `0` to maximize the score, and Bob can pick at most one `0` to minimize the score.
   - The program then iterates over the integers from `1` to `n` to determine the MEX.
   - For each integer `j`, if `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, it means that at most one `j` can be in `c` (either picked by Alice or Bob).
   - The variable `c` is decremented by `1` for each such integer `j` that appears less than twice.
   - If `c` becomes zero or `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of MEX Calculation:**
  - The program correctly identifies that if `0` is not in `a`, the MEX is `0`.
  - For other integers, the program ensures that both players play optimally by considering the minimum number of times an integer can appear in `c` (at most once for each integer that appears less than twice in `a`).

- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that can help maximize the MEX.
  - Bob will always try to pick the smallest integer that can help minimize the MEX.
  - The program correctly handles the scenario where both players play optimally by ensuring that the MEX is calculated based on the minimum number of times each integer can appear in `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
