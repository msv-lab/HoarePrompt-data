The code snippet `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string 'Bob' to the list `answers`. The initial state specifies that `test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. The `answers` list is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it is an existing list. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `answers` includes 'Bob' as its last element.**
