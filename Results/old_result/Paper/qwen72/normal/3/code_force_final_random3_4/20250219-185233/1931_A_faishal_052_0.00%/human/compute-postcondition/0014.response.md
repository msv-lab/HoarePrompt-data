Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer and `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `j` is 0, `range` is 2.**

The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since the initial value of `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, the new value of `lex` is greater than or equal to 26. The other variables remain unchanged.
