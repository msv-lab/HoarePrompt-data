Output State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the largest element less than or equal to the midpoint between `left - f` and `right - f`, `h` is equal to `l`, `mid` is `l`, `mid_sum` is `D[l] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + 1] + f` if `l + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise `mid_next_sum` is undefined, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- The value of `h` remains equal to `l`.
- The value of `mid` remains equal to `l`.
- The value of `mid_sum` remains `D[l] + f`.
- The value of `mid_next_sum` remains `D[l + 1] + f` if `l + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise it remains undefined.
- The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. This means `ans` is now the smaller value between the original `ans` and the larger of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.
