The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `l`, `flag`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the value `2` that is explicitly provided.

Output: **2**
