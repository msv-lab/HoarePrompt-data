Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least -1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is 0, `best` is the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`).
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least -1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, and `total` is updated based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is the minimum of its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. In all cases, `best` retains its value as the minimum of its original value and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, or remains the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`) if `v` is greater than `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least -1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. In either case, `best` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the new `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, but `best` remains the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
