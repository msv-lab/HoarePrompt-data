Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (where 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30) and converts it into a binary string representation of length 30, stored in a list `s`. It then modifies the list `s` according to specific rules: if two consecutive '1's are found, the first '1' is replaced with '-1', and a flag is set. If the flag is set and the last element of `s` is '0', it is changed to '1'. If the flag is set and the last element is not '0', the last element is changed to '0', and an additional '1' is appended to `s`, increasing its length to 31. Finally, it prints the modified list `s`, the length of `s`, and the list `s` again. The function does not return any value. **
