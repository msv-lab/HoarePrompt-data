The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user input, each between 0 and 99 (inclusive). It then prints a value based on the following conditions:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, updates `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, and calculates `bxsfory1` as 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise as `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. It then prints the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0 or if either `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0, it prints 0.
