Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar` that was processed, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`, and `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements found in `ar`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `ar` from the second element to the last element.
- The variable `i` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 after each iteration, so after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to the length of `ar`.
- The variable `num` is initially set to the first element of `ar` and is updated to the value of the current element `ar[i]` whenever a different element is found.
- The variable `same` keeps track of the count of consecutive elements that are equal to `num`. It is incremented by 1 for each consecutive element that matches `num` and reset to 1 when a different element is found.
- The variable `minn` is initially set to `inf` (infinity) and is updated to the minimum value between the current `minn` and `same` whenever a different element is found.
- After the loop finishes, `num` will be the last element of `ar` that was processed, `same` will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`, and `minn` will be the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements found in `ar`.
