Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a set of card descriptions provided by the user, where the cards are represented as a list of 2n unique two-character strings (each string consists of a rank '2'-'9' and a suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). The function also takes a trump suit as input. It pairs cards of the same suit (excluding the trump suit) and prints these pairs with the ranks sorted. If there are any remaining trump cards, it pairs them and prints them. If the function runs out of trump cards before all non-trump pairs are processed, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. The function does not return any value. **
