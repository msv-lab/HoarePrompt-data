Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop. If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `i` is -1, `j` is -1.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3. The 2D list `dp` is fully updated according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, for each valid `i` and `j`, `dp[i][j]` is set based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. The loop variables `i` and `j` are both set to -1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
