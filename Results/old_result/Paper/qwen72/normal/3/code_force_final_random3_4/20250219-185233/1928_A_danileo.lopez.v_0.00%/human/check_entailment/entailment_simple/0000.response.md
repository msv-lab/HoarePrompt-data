### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether Bob can cut an \(a \times b\) rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then reassemble them into a different rectangle. The key insight here is that for Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even. This is because:

1. **Even Dimension Case**: If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle along the even dimension to form two smaller rectangles. These smaller rectangles can then be rotated and reassembled to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
2. **Odd Dimension Case**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, any cut will result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions. Since the product of two odd numbers is always odd, the resulting smaller rectangles can only be reassembled to form the original \(a \times b\) rectangle or a rectangle with the same dimensions but rotated (which is considered the same).

Given this, the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described above. It reads the number of test cases \(t\), processes each test case by reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\), and checks if either dimension is even. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
