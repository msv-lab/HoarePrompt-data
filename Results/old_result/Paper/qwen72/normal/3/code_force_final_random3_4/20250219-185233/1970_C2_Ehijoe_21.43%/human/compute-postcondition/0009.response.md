Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements.**

The code snippet `u, v = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `u` and `v` to the integers provided by the user input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
