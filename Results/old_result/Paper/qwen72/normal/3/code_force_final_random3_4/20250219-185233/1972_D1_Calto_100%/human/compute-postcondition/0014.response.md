Output State: **The program returns the value of `cnt`, which is calculated as the sum of `math.ceil((n - (j * j - j)) / (j * j)) + ((n - (j * j - j)) % (j * j) == 0)` for each `j` in the range from 1 to `m` (inclusive), minus 1.**

Natural language explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is determined by a complex expression involving a loop that iterates from 1 to `m` (inclusive).
- For each `j` in this range, the expression `math.ceil((n - (j * j - j)) / (j * j)) + ((n - (j * j - j)) % (j * j) == 0)` is evaluated.
- The `math.ceil` function rounds up the division result to the nearest integer.
- The term `((n - (j * j - j)) % (j * j) == 0)` adds 1 to the sum if `n - (j * j - j)` is exactly divisible by `j * j`.
- After summing these values for all `j` in the range, 1 is subtracted from the total.
- The final value of `cnt` is returned by the program.
