Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 3. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1, 2, 3, and `q // 3` if `q` is not divisible by `i`, or a list that includes the values 1, `q // 3`, and 3 if `q` is divisible by `i`. If `q // i` is less than `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1 and 2.***
