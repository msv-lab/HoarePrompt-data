Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
- `trump` is assigned the value of user input.
- `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order and must contain at least one element.
- `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element.
- Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`.
- The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`trumps` List**: 
   - `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order and must contain at least one element. This means it contains at least one trump card rank.
   - Since the list is sorted in descending order, the first element (index 0) is the highest rank, and the last element (index -1) is the lowest rank.

2. **`trump` Variable**:
   - `trump` is the suit assigned by user input. This suit is used to form the trump cards.

3. **`trumps.pop()`**:
   - The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element of the list by default. Since `trumps` is sorted in descending order, `trumps.pop()` will return the lowest rank in the list.
   - The second `trumps.pop()` will return the second lowest rank in the list.

4. **Formatted String**:
   - The formatted string `f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'` will concatenate the rank returned by `trumps.pop()` with the `trump` suit, and do this twice to form two trump cards.

### Output Calculation:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return the lowest rank in the `trumps` list.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return the second lowest rank in the `trumps` list.
- Both ranks will be concatenated with the `trump` suit.

### Final Output:
Output: **[second lowest rank in trumps][trump] [lowest rank in trumps][trump] (where [trump] is the user-provided trump suit and [second lowest rank in trumps] and [lowest rank in trumps] are the second lowest and lowest ranks in the `trumps` list, respectively)**

This output is based on the precondition that `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order and contains at least one element. The `pop()` method will remove the last elements of this list, which are the lowest and second lowest ranks.
