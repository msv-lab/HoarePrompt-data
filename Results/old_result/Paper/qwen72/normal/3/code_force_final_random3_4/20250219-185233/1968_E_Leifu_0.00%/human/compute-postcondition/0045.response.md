Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is `t - 1`. If `n` == 3, there are no changes to `t`, `i`, or `n`. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and `j` is set to `n` for the last iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The input integer `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is only used to determine the number of iterations.
- **`i`**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `t - 1` because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = t - 1`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` is read from the input for each iteration of the loop. If `n` is 3, no additional changes are made. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the inner loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n`, and `j` is set to `n` for the last iteration.
- **`j`**: The variable `j` is only relevant within the inner loop and is set to `n` for the last iteration if `n` is greater than or equal to 4. If `n` is 3, `j` is not used.

This output state describes the final values of the variables `i` and `j` after the loop has completed all its iterations, while `t` and `n` remain as they were defined in the initial state.
