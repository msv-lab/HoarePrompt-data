Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100 and x is greater than or equal to k - 2 and not equal to k - 1, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, `s` is the second line of the input file, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `z` is the result of the loop body being applied `x - k + 3` times. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the program retains these conditions. If `a` is less than `z`, the program also retains these conditions.***
