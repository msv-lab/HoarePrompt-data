Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores them in a list named `ar`. The initial state variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the new list `ar` is created based on the input provided.
