The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0**
