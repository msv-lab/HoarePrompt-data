Output State: **`s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `ans` is 'AABBC', `x` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `ans` is 'AA'.
- `x` is 1, so `s[x]` is 'B'.
- `ans += s[x] * 2` appends 'BB' to `ans`, making `ans` 'AABBC'.
- The values of `s`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
