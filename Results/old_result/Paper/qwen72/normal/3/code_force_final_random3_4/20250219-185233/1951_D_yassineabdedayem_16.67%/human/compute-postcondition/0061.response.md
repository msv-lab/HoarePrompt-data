Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to integer values read from the input, `n` must be a non-zero integer and `k` must be a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder variable, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration, `number` is equal to `Min`, `k` is equal to `k - Max`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
