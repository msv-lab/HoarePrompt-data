Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `N` is an input integer.**
