Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, and `b` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is set to 1, `i` remains 0, and `j` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `i` is set to 1, and `j` remains 0.***
