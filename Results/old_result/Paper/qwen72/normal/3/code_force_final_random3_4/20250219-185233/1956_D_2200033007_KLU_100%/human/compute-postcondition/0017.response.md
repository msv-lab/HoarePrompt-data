Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, `is_already_stairs` is False, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, `arr[start_index]` is 1.**

The value of `arr[start_index]` is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `i` being a non-negative integer, `j` still 0, `i + 1` still 1, `is_already_stairs` still False, and `res` still containing the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`.
