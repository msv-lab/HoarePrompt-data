Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last. To maximize this beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty as the difference between the last and the first element, which is the maximum possible difference in the array. This is because the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be maximized by the largest and smallest elements, and all other differences will cancel out or be minimized.

However, the provided program does not follow this optimal strategy. Instead, it simply finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. While this approach does provide the correct output for the given examples, it does not correctly implement the logic of summing the differences between consecutive elements as described in the problem statement. The correct approach should involve sorting the array and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Given the problem description, the program is **incorrect** because it does not compute the beauty of the array as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

Correctness: **False**
