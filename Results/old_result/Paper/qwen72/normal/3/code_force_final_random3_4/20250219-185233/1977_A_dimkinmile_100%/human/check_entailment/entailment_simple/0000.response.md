Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `kreker` from the input. This is correctly handled as it reads a single integer from the input.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program uses a loop to handle each test case. This is appropriate for the problem, which specifies multiple test cases.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. However, the function does not take any parameters, which is a mistake. It should take `n` and `m` as parameters to be more modular and clear.

4. **Reading `n` and `m`**: Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input. This is correct and matches the problem description.

5. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. This condition is correct:
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes to achieve the desired result.
   - `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes, which is necessary because you cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves you have made.

6. **Output**: The program prints "Yes" if the condition is true and "No" otherwise. This matches the problem's output requirements.

However, the function `func_1()` should be called with the appropriate parameters `n` and `m` from the loop. The current implementation of the loop does not pass these parameters to the function, which is a mistake.

**Corrected Program**:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, m)

def func_1(n, m):
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

**Conclusion**:
The original program is incorrect because the function `func_1()` is not defined to take parameters and is not called with the appropriate arguments. Therefore, the program as given does not correctly handle the input for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
