The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is initialized to `n-1` before the loop starts, but for the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0, and `possible` is False**
