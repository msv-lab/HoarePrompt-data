Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a single line of input and splits it into three parts, converting each part into an integer and assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `m` as input integers, along with the unchanged values of `t` and `i`.
