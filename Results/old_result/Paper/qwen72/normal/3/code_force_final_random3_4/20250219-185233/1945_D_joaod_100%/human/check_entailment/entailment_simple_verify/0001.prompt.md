You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is `cases - 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers input by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum total cost of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `na_frente` and the maximum allowable final position `pos_final`.
   - It then reads the costs `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each person in the queue.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each. This is necessary because the problem description uses 1-based indexing, while Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the total cost Kirill needs to spend.
   - `best` is initialized to `sys.float_info.max`, which is a very large number to ensure that any valid cost will be less than this initial value.

4. **Iterating Backwards:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue (`na_frente` to 0) to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `pos_final` positions.
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the range of `pos_final`, the program checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
     - The program then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` to account for the cost of moving to the next position.
     - If `v` is not within the range of `pos_final`, the program simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all positions, the program prints the best cost found for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The program correctly identifies the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `pos_final` positions.
- The logic for updating `best` and `total` is sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.
- The use of `sys.float_info.max` ensures that the initial value of `best` is large enough to be updated by any valid cost.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `pos_final` is 0, which is not possible according to the problem constraints (1 ≤ m ≤ n). However, since the problem guarantees valid inputs, this is not a concern.
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where `na_frente` is 0, but the loop will not run in this case, and the program will correctly output 0 as the cost.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `pos_final` positions by iterating backwards and keeping track of the best cost.

### Correctness:
**True**
