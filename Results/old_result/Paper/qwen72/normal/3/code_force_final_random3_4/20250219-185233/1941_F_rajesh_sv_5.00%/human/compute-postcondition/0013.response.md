Postcondition: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is now a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is -infinity, `index` is None, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`, and `next_max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains -infinity.**
