Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. If `n` is less than 3, no changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `j` remains `n` and `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `j` is set to `eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]]` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of `q[eta[k]]` for all `k` from 0 to `i - 1` + `q[eta[i]])` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `w`. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0. If `n` is 3 or greater, it calculates the number of unique triplets in `w` that can be formed such that all elements in the triplet are the same. It prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the input values `t`, `n`, and `w` for each test case, and the printed results for each test case.
