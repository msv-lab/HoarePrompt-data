Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `r` is 3, and `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `r` remains 3.
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The specific value of `sum` after this update depends on its initial value, but the new value is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.
