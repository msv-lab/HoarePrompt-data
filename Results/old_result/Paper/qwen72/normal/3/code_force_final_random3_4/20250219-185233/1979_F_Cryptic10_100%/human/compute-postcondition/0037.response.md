Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least as many tuples as the number of iterations, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop executes all iterations:
- The value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 2.
- The variable `_` remains a throwaway variable and is not affected.
- The set `vx` still contains exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`.
- The list `ops` must have contained at least as many tuples as the number of iterations the loop executed.
- The list `p1` will contain the original 2 integers from `vx` and any `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was not equal to `v2`.
- The list `p2` will contain the `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was equal to `v2`.
