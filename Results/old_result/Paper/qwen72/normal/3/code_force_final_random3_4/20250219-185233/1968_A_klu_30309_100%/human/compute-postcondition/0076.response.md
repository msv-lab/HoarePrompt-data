Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `best_y` is `x - 3`.** 

The value of `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, and `best_y` is updated to `x - 3`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `y`, and `gcd_val` remain unchanged. The value of `current_sum` is also unchanged but is now equal to `max_sum`.
