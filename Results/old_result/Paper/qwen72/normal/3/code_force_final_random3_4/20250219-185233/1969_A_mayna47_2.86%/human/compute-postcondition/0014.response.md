Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `v[v[v[i]]]` is equal to `i`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, the program also returns nothing.***
