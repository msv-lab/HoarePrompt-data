Output State: **The list `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the list `a`, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies (0 ≤ a_i < n), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value type `int` and now contains each unique integer `a_i` from the list `a` as keys with their respective values being the count of how many times each integer appears in the list `a`, `i` is `N-1`, `N` is the size of the list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cnt` dictionary will have counted the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. The key for each unique integer in `a` will be present in `cnt`, and the value associated with each key will be the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `N-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`, and `N` will be the total number of elements in the list `a`. The initial conditions for `a`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
