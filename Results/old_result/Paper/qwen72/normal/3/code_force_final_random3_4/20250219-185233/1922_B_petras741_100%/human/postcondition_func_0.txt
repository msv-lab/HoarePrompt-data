The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `w`. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0. If `n` is 3 or greater, it calculates the number of unique triplets in `w` that can be formed such that all elements in the triplet are the same. It prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the input values `t`, `n`, and `w` for each test case, and the printed results for each test case.
