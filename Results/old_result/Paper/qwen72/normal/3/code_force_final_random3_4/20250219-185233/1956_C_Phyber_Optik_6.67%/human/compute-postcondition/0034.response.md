Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`).
   - `j` is set to 2.

2. **Determine the value of `r`:**
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > i \cdot n
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by `n`:
     \[
     \frac{n + 1}{2} > i
     \]
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).
   - The largest `i` that satisfies this condition is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\), but since `i` is an integer, the largest `i` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\).
   - If \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\) is less than `n`, then `r` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\). Otherwise, `r` is `n`.

3. **Determine the value of `j % n`:**
   - `j` is set to 2.
   - `j % n` is the remainder when 2 is divided by `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the possible values for `j % n` are:
     - If `n` is 1, then `j % n` is 0.
     - If `n` is 2, then `j % n` is 0.
     - If `n` is greater than 2, then `j % n` is 2.

4. **Determine the condition `j <= n + r`:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\) or `n`.
   - Therefore, `n + r` is at least `n + 1` (since `r` is at least 1).
   - Since `j` is 2, the condition `j <= n + r` will always hold true because `n + r` is always greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Print statement:**
   - The print statement is:
     \[
     \text{print(2, j \% n, end=' ')}
     \]
   - `2` is printed as is.
   - `j % n` is calculated based on the value of `n`:
     - If `n` is 1 or 2, `j % n` is 0.
     - If `n` is greater than 2, `j % n` is 2.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

**Final Output:**
- If `n` is 1 or 2:
  Output: **2 0**
- If `n` is greater than 2:
  Output: **2 2**
