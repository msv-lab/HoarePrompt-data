Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the fourth line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the fourth line of the input file, `s` is the fourth line of the input file, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + z // (k - 1) + 1 + z // (k - 1) + 1`, `x - k + 3` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- The new value of `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + z // (k - 1) + 1 + z // (k - 1) + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
