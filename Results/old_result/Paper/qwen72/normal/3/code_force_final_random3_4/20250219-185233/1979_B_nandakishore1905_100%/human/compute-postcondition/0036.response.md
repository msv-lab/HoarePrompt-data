The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **1**
