Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `t` must be greater than 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
   - `j` is 4.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly defined as 4.
   - The `print` statement converts `j` to a string and concatenates it with a space and another string representation of `j`.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string "4 4".

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string "4 4".

Output: **4 4**
