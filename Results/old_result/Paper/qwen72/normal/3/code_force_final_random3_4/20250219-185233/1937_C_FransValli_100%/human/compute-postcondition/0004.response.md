Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `maxi` is 0.

The `print` statement is:
```
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

- The first element is the string `'?'`.
- The second and third elements are the value of `maxi`, which is 0.
- The fourth and fifth elements are the value of `i`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
