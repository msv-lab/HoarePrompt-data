Postcondition: ***`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `n // 2`. If `n` is even, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAABBCC...CC' (where 'C' is repeated `n // 2 - 1` times), and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.***
