Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. `vx` has two elements removed, the first being `v3` and the second being `v1`. `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)`.**

Explanation:
- `v1` and `v2` are still assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`.
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.
- `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
- `vx` has two elements removed, the first being `v3` and the second being `v1`.
- `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)`.
