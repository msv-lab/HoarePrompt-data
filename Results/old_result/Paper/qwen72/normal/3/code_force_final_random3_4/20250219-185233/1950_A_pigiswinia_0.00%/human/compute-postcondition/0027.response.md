The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each iteration, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function does not return any value; it is expected to perform some operation or process using these digits during each iteration.

Functionality: **The function is called within a loop running `t` times (1 <= t <= 1000). For each iteration, it accepts three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) as input and performs an operation with these digits, but does not return any value.**
