Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user.
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `tc > 5`.
   - `ppp` is either 23 or not 23.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The values of `s` and `e` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The values of `l`, `r`, `eli`, `LA`, `tc`, and `ppp` are not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is hard-coded to print `-1` and `-1`, the output will be:

Output: **-1, -1**
