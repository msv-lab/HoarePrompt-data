Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `n` is odd.
   - `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
   - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - The current value of `2 * a` is less than `b`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(a * n)` will print the product of `a` and `n`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - `a` is an integer between 1 and 30.
   - `n` is an odd integer between 1 and 100.
   - The condition `2 * a < b` is given, but it does not affect the value of `a * n` directly.

Since `a` and `n` are both integers within their respective ranges, the product `a * n` will be an integer. The exact value of `a * n` depends on the specific values of `a` and `n`, but we can describe it based on the given ranges.

Output: **a * n (where a is an integer between 1 and 30, and n is an odd integer between 1 and 100)**
