Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `sum` is `n + i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n`, and `r` is 0 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, otherwise `r` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `sum += i * n` increments the value of `sum` by `i * n`.
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` was initially `n + i * n`, and after the increment, it remains `n + i * n`.
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` was initially `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n`, and after the increment, it remains `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n`.
- The value of `r` is determined by the initial condition and remains unchanged.
- The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by the code.
- The value of `i` is 3, and it is used in the calculation of `sum`.
- The updated value of `sum` is `n + i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n`.
