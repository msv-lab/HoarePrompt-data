Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `trumps` list is empty because all the elements in it have been popped and used in the loop. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged, as it was not modified by the loop. The `answers` list still contains the strings representing the pairs of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), in the same format as before.
