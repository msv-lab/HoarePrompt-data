Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It then counts the number of elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len(a), len(b))`. If both counts are greater than or equal to `k // 2`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that all input variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) are consumed, and the output for each test case is printed to the console. **
