Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 2` elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `y` is the third element in `inp`. If `a` ≤ `y`, `ans` is 0 (or 1, depending on the condition in the previous iteration). Otherwise, `ans` is 1 (or 2, depending on the condition in the previous iteration).***
