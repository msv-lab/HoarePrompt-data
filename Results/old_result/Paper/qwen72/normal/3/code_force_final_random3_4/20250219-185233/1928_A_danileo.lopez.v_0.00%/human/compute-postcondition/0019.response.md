The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). The function returns the result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function returns the result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given constraints.**
