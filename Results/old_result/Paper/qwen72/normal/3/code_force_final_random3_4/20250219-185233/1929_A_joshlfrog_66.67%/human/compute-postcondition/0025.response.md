The only variables in the loop head are `e` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `e` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `e` is 0. Since `e` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `e` must be 1 and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**
