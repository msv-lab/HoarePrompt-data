### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input (stdin) and processes it to create a list of test cases.
   - Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - The function correctly parses the input and constructs the test cases as expected.

2. **Processing Test Cases (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before in the dictionary `freq` and increments the count if it has.
   - It then updates the dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for determining if a pair is beautiful is based on the conditions:
     - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - The function correctly calculates `rx` and `ry` to check these conditions.
   - The use of the dictionary `freq` ensures that the function efficiently counts the number of pairs that meet the conditions.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of results, where each result is the count of beautiful pairs for a test case.
   - The function `func_2` prints each result to the standard output (stdout).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints provided in the problem statement, including the maximum values for `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - The function correctly processes multiple test cases and returns the correct count for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The input handling, processing, and output are all consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
