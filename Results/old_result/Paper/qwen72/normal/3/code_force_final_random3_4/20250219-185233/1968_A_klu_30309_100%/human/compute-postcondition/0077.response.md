Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `best_y` is `x - 3`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `best_y = y` assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `y` is already defined as `x - 3`, `best_y` now holds the same value, which is `x - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
