The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `c` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1 and `cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1, and `cases` must still be greater than `c`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers input by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all iterations where `v` ≤ `pos_final`.**
