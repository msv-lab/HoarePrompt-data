### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Structure**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the non-trump cards for each suit.
   - It also uses a list `trumps` to store the ranks of the trump cards.

3. **Card Processing**:
   - The program iterates through the list of cards and categorizes them into trump and non-trump cards.
   - For non-trump cards, it tries to pair them with another card of the same suit. If a pair is found, it sorts the ranks and appends the pair to the `answers` list.
   - If a non-trump card cannot be paired with another card of the same suit, it is stored in the `suits` dictionary for potential pairing later.

4. **Pairing Remaining Cards**:
   - After processing all the cards, the program attempts to pair any remaining non-trump cards with trump cards.
   - If there are no trump cards left to pair with a non-trump card, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the pairs of cards in the required format.
   - If there are any remaining trump cards, it pairs them with each other and prints them.
   - Finally, it prints the pairs stored in the `answers` list.

### Issues:
- **Function Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will cause a `NameError` in Python. The function should be defined before it is called.
- **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of rounds `n` but does not use it directly in the logic. This is a minor issue but could lead to confusion.
- **Pairing Logic**: The logic for pairing non-trump cards with trump cards is not robust. It assumes that any remaining non-trump card can be paired with any remaining trump card, which might not always be valid according to the game rules.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as it stands. The function call order is incorrect, and the pairing logic for non-trump cards with trump cards is not robust enough to ensure that the game rules are followed.

**Correctness: False**
