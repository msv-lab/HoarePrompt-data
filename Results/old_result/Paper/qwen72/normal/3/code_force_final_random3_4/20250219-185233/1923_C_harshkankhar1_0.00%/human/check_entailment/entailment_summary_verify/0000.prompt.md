You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes an array `c` and a list of queries. It first reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input, where `n` is the length of the array `c` and `q` is the number of queries. It then reads the array `c` from the input and initializes an auxiliary array `b`. The function computes the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in `a`. For each query, represented by a tuple `(x, y)`, the function checks if the sum of the subarray `c[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum in the auxiliary array `b` or if `x == y`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all queries, the function terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has only one element. According to the problem description, a subarray is considered good if there exists an array `b` such that the sum of the elements in `b` is equal to the sum of the elements in the subarray of `c`, and `b_i` is not equal to `c_i` for every index `i`, and `b_i` is greater than 0. For a subarray with only one element, it is impossible to find such an array `b` because `b_i` must be different from `c_i` and greater than 0, which cannot be satisfied if `c_i` is 1 (since the only positive integer smaller than 1 is 0, and `b_i` cannot be 0). The program incorrectly prints "NO" for all subarrays with a single element, which is correct, but it does not print "YES" for subarrays where it should. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 1
4 4
3 3
1 3
```

The output should be:

```
NO
NO
NO
YES
```

However, the program will output:

```
NO
NO
NO
NO
```

This is incorrect because the subarray `c[1:3]` (i.e., `[1, 2, 1]`) is good, but the program incorrectly prints "NO" for it.
