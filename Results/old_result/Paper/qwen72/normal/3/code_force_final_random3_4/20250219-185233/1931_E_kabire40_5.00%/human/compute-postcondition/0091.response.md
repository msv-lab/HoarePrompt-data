Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list` + 2, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of at least one element of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string and has at least one more element, `val_in` is the element at index `x` in the list `rev_val`.**

Explanation:
- `val_in` is assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `rev_val`.
- The values of `y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`, `x_rev`, and `rev_val` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `val_in` depends on the value of `x` and the contents of `rev_val`, but it is updated to the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.
