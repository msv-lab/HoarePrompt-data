Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least -1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `best` retains its value as the minimum of its original value and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, or remains the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`) if `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` retains its value as the minimum of its original value and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, or remains the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`) if `v` is greater than `pos_final`.***
