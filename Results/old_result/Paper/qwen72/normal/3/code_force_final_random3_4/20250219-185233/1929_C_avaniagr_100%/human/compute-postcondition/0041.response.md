Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file, `s` is the third line of the input file, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 0, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `z` is `k - 2`.
- The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates `z` by adding the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1` to the current value of `z`.
- Therefore, the new value of `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition `x - k + 3 > 0` is still valid.
