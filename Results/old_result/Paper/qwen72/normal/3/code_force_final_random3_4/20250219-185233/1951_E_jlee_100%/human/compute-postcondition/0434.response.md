Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is equal to `count` with `count` > 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is equal to `count` with `count` less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `count` retains its initial value. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, `count` is less than 1, and `done` is False. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values.***
