Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[1]]` by 1, since `j` is 1. The initial state specifies that `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, and this state remains unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than 1, and `j` remains 1. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `q[w[1]]` by 1.
