Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration and has been incremented by `t` times, `n` is the input integer from the last test case, `ar` is a list of integers from the last test case with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar` that was processed, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`, and `minn` is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in all the test cases. If `minn` is `inf`, it indicates that there were no sequences of consecutive same numbers in any of the test cases. Otherwise, `minn` is the smallest length of such sequences found across all test cases.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- The temporary variable `_` has been incremented by `t` times, but its value is not used.
- The variable `n` holds the input integer from the last test case.
- The variable `ar` holds the list of integers from the last test case, and it has at least 2 elements.
- The variable `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list.
- The variable `num` holds the last element of `ar` that was processed.
- The variable `same` holds the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num` in the last test case.
- The variable `minn` holds the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number across all test cases. If `minn` is `inf`, it means no such sequences were found in any of the test cases. Otherwise, `minn` is the smallest length of such sequences found.
