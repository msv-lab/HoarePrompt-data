Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and `v1` is appended to it, `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `((p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1))` checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.
- If `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- If `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `vx`, and `ops` remain unchanged.
- The value of `p1` is updated if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`.
- The value of `p2` is updated if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`.
