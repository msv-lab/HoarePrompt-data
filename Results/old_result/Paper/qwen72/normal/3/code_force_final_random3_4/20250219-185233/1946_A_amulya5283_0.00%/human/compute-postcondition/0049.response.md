The code snippet `median_index = n // 2` assigns the value of `n // 2` to the variable `median_index`. Since `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, and `n` is a positive integer, the value of `median_index` is updated to be the integer division of `n` by 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are strictly greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**
