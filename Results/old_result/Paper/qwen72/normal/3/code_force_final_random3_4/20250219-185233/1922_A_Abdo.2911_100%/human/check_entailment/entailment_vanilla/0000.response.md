### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Conditions:**
   - The template `t` must be such that for each position `i`:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must equal `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must differ from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

3. **Checking for a Valid Template:**
   - The function iterates through each position `i` of the strings.
   - It checks if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`:
     - If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then a valid template can be constructed by making `t[i]` the uppercase version of `a[i]`.
     - If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` is the same as `a[i]`, then it is impossible to construct a valid template for this position.
   - If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`:
     - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then a valid template can be constructed by making `t[i]` the uppercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
     - If `c[i]` is the same as either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then it is impossible to construct a valid template for this position.

4. **Output:**
   - If a valid template is found, the function prints "YES".
   - If no valid template is found, the function prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the input and iterates through each position of the strings.
- It correctly identifies the conditions under which a valid template can be constructed:
  - If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different, a valid template can be constructed.
  - If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both, a valid template can be constructed.
- The function correctly prints "YES" or "NO" based on the above conditions.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
