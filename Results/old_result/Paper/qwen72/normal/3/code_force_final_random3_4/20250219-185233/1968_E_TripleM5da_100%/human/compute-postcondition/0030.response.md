The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 5**
