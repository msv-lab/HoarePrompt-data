Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer greater than 0, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except the element at index `pb - 1`, which is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` adds the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `pathb`. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
