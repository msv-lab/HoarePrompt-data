Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `S` is a list containing `[0, 0]`, `[x, y]`, and the last sublist `[x, y]` (where `x` and `y` are updated based on the second character of `a`). `s` is the third character of `a`. If `s` is '0', `x` is incremented by 1 and remains the second element of the last sublist in `S`, while `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y` is incremented by 1 and becomes the third element of the last sublist in `S`, while `x` remains unchanged.***
