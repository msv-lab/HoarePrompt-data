#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 < n <= 10^9 and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. The function computes the prime factorization of `n`, storing the prime factors and their respective powers in a dictionary `factors`. After the factorization, the function converts the keys of `factors` into a list `primes` and yields each prime factor from this list. The final state of the program includes `factors` containing the prime factors of `n` and their powers, `nn` being equal to 1, and `i` being the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original `n`.

    #State: k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where primes is a list of prime numbers. If k is equal to the length of the primes list, the generator has yielded the value 1. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and all possible products of each `factor` in `rest` with each power of `prime` from 1 up to `primes[k]` raised to the power of `factors[prime]` have been yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` is a generator that, given a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), yields all possible products of the first `k` primes in the `primes` list raised to the powers specified in the `factors` dictionary. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, the generator yields the value 1. For each prime in the `primes` list up to the `k`-th prime, the generator recursively multiplies the results of the next level of recursion with the current prime raised to all powers from 0 up to the value specified in `factors` for that prime. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all such products have been yielded, and the generator is exhausted.
