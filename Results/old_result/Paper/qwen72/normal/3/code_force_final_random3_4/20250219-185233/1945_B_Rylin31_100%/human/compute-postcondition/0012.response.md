Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18) from the input. It then calculates and prints the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed. **
