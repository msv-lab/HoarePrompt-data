Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`).
- `j` is 3.
- `n + r + 1` must be greater than 3.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `r`**:
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > i \cdot n
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by `n` (since `n > 0`):
     \[
     \frac{n + 1}{2} > i
     \]
   - Multiplying both sides by 2:
     \[
     n + 1 > 2i
     \]
   - Rearranging:
     \[
     i < \frac{n + 1}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `i < (n + 1) / 2`. This means `r` is the largest integer less than or equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Understanding the condition `n + r + 1 > 3`**:
   - Since `r` is at most `n // 2`, the condition `n + r + 1 > 3` will always be true for `n > 1` because:
     \[
     n + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \geq n + 1 + 1 = n + 2
     \]
   - For `n = 1`, `r` would be 0, and the condition `1 + 0 + 1 > 3` is false. However, the problem states that `n + r + 1` must be greater than 3, so `n` must be at least 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so the `print` function will print all these integers separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
- Since `n` is greater than 0 and must be at least 2 for the condition `n + r + 1 > 3` to hold, the `print` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n, and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to n)**
