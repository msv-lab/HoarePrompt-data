You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have two installations launching fireworks at intervals `a` and `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It then calculates the number of fireworks visible at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`.

3. **Evaluating the Formula**:
   - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the first `m` minutes.
   - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the first `m` minutes.
   - The `+ 2` part is incorrect. It does not account for the visibility overlap correctly.

4. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct approach is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at any given minute.
   - For each minute `x` from `0` to `m`, we need to count how many fireworks from both installations are visible.
   - A firework launched at minute `x` by the first installation will be visible from `x` to `x + m`.
   - A firework launched at minute `y` by the second installation will be visible from `y` to `y + m`.

5. **Finding the Overlap**:
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the maximum number of overlapping intervals.
   - The maximum overlap occurs when the intervals of the two installations overlap the most.
   - The correct formula should be `min((m + 1) // a + 1, (m + 1) // b + 1) + 1`.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `6 7 4`:
     - The first installation launches fireworks at `0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42`.
     - The second installation launches fireworks at `0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42`.
     - The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (at minute 42).
   - For the input `7 8 56`:
     - The first installation launches fireworks at `0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56`.
     - The second installation launches fireworks at `0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56`.
     - The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 17 (at minute 56).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program's formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect.
   - The correct formula should be `min((m + 1) // a + 1, (m + 1) // b + 1) + 1`.
