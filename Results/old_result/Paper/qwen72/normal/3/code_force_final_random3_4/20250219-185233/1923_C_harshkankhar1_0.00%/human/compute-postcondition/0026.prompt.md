You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually take parameters to process the input. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`, ..., `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 1` if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
    #   - The exact values of `a` depend on the original values, but they will be the cumulative sums of the original list up to `n`.
    #
    #Output:
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n`, `a` is the cumulative sum of its original values, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if the new `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if the new `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`, ..., `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 1` if the new `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 2, `q` is 0. The program prints 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise it prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the length of the array `c`, an integer `q` representing the number of queries, a list of integers `c` where each element is greater than 0, and a list of `q` tuples `queries` where each tuple contains two integers representing the borders of a subarray. For each test case, the function processes the queries on the array `c` and returns the results of these queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
