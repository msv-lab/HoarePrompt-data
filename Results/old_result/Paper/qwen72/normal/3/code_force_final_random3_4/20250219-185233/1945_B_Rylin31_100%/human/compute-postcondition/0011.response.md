The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `a`, `b`, and `m` where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact output is not specified in the provided information.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
