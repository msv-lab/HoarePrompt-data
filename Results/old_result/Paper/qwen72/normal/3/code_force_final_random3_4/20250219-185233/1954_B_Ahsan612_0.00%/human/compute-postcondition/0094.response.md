Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least two elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the third element of `ar`, `i` is 2, `minn` is 1, and the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**

The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` because it is already set to 1 in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
