Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, and `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9. `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. If `x` == `k` - 1, the condition for the loop remains unchanged. Otherwise, `z` is the result of the loop after `x` + 1 iterations, `i` is `x`, and the relationship between `a` and `z` is preserved: if `a` >= `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`; if `a` < `z`, then `a` is less than `z`.***
