Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 0.
2. `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
3. `a` is an input string.
4. `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character '>'.
5. `k` is the last even number less than `n` + 2.
6. If `a[k]` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `k`**:
   - `k` is the last even number less than `n` + 2.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, then `n + 2` is 7. The last even number less than 7 is 6.
   - If `n` is 6, then `n + 2` is 8. The last even number less than 8 is 6.
   - If `n` is 7, then `n + 2` is 9. The last even number less than 9 is 8.
   - In general, `k` will be `n + 1` if `n` is odd, and `n` if `n` is even.

2. **Check the condition for `no_path`**:
   - The condition `if a[k] is not '>'` determines the value of `no_path`.
   - If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is set to False.
   - If `a[k]` is '>', then `no_path` remains True.

3. **Print statement**:
   - The code snippet `print(k)` will print the value of `k`.

### Final Output:
- Since `k` is the last even number less than `n` + 2, and `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` will be either `n` if `n` is even, or `n + 1` if `n` is odd.
- The value of `k` is determined by the input integer `n`.

Output: **k (where k is the last even number less than n + 2)**
