The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input (stdin) and processes this input to create a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing four elements: two integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of integers `arr`.

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin and returns a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of integers `arr`.**
