Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence. The program then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using a specific formula and prints the result for each test case.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The outer list comprehension iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.

2. **Calculation:**
   - The inner list comprehension calculates the sum of a series of values.
   - For each integer `x` in the sequence (representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s):
     - `3 * (x // 2)` calculates the number of pairs of the same number, each pair contributing 0 to the XOR sum.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` handles the remaining single number if `x` is odd. If `i < 3` (i.e., for 1s, 2s, and 3s), it adds 1 to the sum, otherwise, it adds 0 (since 4s do not affect the XOR sum in this context).
   - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

3. **Output:**
   - The results for all test cases are joined into a single string with newline characters and printed.

This logic correctly implements the strategy to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally. The formula used ensures that Bob wins as many times as possible by leveraging the properties of XOR and the counts of the numbers.

Thus, the program is correct.
