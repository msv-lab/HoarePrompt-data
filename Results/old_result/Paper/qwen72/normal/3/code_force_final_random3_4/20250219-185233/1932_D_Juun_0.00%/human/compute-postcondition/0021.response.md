Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `trumps`, `rank`, and `suit` remain unchanged; `answers` has a new element appended, which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of the previous `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, followed by `suit`; `suits[suit]` is now `None`.**

The code updates the `suits[suit]` to `None`, but the `answers` list has already been updated with a new element before this change, which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of the previous `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, followed by `suit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
