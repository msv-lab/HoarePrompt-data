Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in reverse order, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `array = list(range(1, n + 1))` updates the `array` variable to a list of integers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive. Since this is the only change in the code, all other variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
