The only objects in the loop head are `itm` and `mex`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `mex`. If `mex` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the value of `minn` before the iteration or the absolute difference between the corresponding element in `arr` and `minn`, and `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `mex` must have at least one element.

State: **`minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `n - 1`**
