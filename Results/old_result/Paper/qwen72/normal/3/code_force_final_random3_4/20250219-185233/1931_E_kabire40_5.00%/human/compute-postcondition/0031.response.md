Postcondition: ***`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string, and the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is not even, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string, plus the reversed string of `val_in`.***
