Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 27`. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.***
