You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n followed by a list of n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. Each test case list should be structured as [n, [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]], with 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for each value `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` remains a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of `x // 4` for each value `x` in `cnt.values()`.
    #   - Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of `x // 4` for each count `x` in `cnt`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user input. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and calculates the sum of the integer counts divided by 4 (using integer division). Finally, it prints this sum. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is a good approach to keep track of how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons**: The program then iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` and for each value `x` (which represents the count of a particular stick length), it calculates `x // 4` and adds this to the answer `ans`. The idea here is that a regular polygon with at least 3 sides can be formed, and the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed from `x` sticks of the same length is `x // 4` (since each polygon requires at least 3 sides, but the program is assuming the minimum polygon is a square, which requires 4 sides).

4. **Output**: The program prints the answer `ans` for each test case.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:

- **Polygon Formation Assumption**: The program assumes that the only regular polygon that can be formed is a square (4-sided polygon). This is incorrect because the problem statement allows for the formation of any regular polygon with at least 3 sides. For example, if there are 3 sticks of the same length, they can form an equilateral triangle, which is a valid regular polygon.

To fix this, the program should consider the formation of polygons with 3 or more sides, not just 4-sided polygons. The correct approach would be to calculate the maximum number of polygons for each possible number of sides (from 3 to `x`), and then sum these up.

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct output for test cases where the optimal solution involves forming polygons with fewer than 4 sides.

Correctness: **False**
