Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated to the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The substring is determined by the values of `x` and `y`, which are the indices of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` and the reversed `arr`, respectively.
- The length of the substring `z` depends on the values of `x`, `y`, and `n`. If `x` or `y` is -1, `z` will be an empty string or an invalid slice, which results in an empty string.
