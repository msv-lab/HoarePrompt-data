Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `A` is True; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, `set_` must have at least 4 elements; `i` is 3; if the difference between the fourth element of `set_` and the third element of `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` is True and `i` remains 3.**
