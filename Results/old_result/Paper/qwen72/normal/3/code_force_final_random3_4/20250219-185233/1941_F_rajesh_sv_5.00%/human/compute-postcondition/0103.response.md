The variables in the loop head are `l` and `h`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `l < h`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` must be less than `h`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true.

Given the updates in the loop body:
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.

We need to ensure that after these updates, `l` is still less than `h`.

Since `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid` is always between `l` and `h` (inclusive of `l` but exclusive of `h`).

- If `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `l` will be at least `mid + 1` and `h` will still be greater than `mid`, so `l` will be less than `h`.
- If `h` is updated to `mid`, `h` will be equal to `mid`, and since `l` is less than `mid`, `l` will still be less than `h`.

Therefore, the condition `l < h` will still hold true after the updates, and the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.**
