The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 4, because `range(4, n + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 4 up to `n` (inclusive), and the loop will not execute if `n` is less than 4.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 (this variable is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
- `i` is 1 (this variable is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
- `n` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 4, and `j` must be 4 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
