Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and for each integer `i` in `a`, `cntl[i]` is increased by 1. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the current value of `cntl[0]` remains 0. Otherwise, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `n` is the length of the list `cntl` minus 1, and `j` is the first index (starting from 1) where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists. `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 before `c` reached 0 or `j` reached `n`.***
