Output State: **`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29), the loop has processed each element from index 0 to 28, `s[29]` is '1', and `flag` is 0.**

The code snippet `s[29] = '1'` has updated the 29th element of the list `s` to '1'. Since the initial value of `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` was '0', the condition for setting `s[29]` to '1' and `flag` to 0 has been met. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
