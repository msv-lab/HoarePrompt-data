The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, and the loop depends on the input provided to `range()`. The loop will execute if the input to `range()` is a positive integer. Given the context that the function should handle multiple test cases, the input to `range()` should be the number of test cases `t`, which must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (at least 1) and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0**
