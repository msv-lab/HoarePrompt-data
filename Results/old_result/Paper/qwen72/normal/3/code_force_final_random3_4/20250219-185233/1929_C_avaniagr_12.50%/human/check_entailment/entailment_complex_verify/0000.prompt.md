You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    YES

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, and `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` have been updated to the integers provided by the user input. If `x` < `k - 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` has been checked and the appropriate output ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed. If `x` == `k - 1`, the condition `a >= x + 3` has been checked and the appropriate output ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed. If `x` > `k - 1`, `z` has been calculated as the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, and the condition `a >= z` has been checked and the appropriate output ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9). The function evaluates a condition based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Specifically, if `x` is less than `k - 1`, it checks if `a` is at least `x + 1`. If `x` equals `k - 1`, it checks if `a` is at least `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` as the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, and checks if `a` is at least `z`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins required (`z`) is flawed. The loop that calculates `z` does not correctly simulate the required number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can always achieve at least `n` coins.

For example, consider the test case `k = 2`, `x = 1`, and `a = 1`. According to the problem description, Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row. If Sasha starts with 1 coin and loses the first bet, he will have 0 coins and cannot place any more bets. Therefore, he cannot guarantee having any number of coins `n` greater than 1. However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" for this case because it does not correctly account for the minimum number of coins required to ensure he can always win.

The correct logic should be more complex, considering the maximum number of consecutive losses and the multiplier `k` to ensure that Sasha can always recover and reach any desired number of coins `n`. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
