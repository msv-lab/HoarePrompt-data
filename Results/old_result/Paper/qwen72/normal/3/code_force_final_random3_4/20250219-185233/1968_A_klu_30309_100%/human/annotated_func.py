    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have `t` elements, `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that `gcd_val + y` is maximized, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y` and `y` itself is maximized, for each `x` in the list `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`, where `1 <= t <= 1000` and each integer `x` in `test_cases` satisfies `2 <= x <= 1000`. It returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and `y` itself is maximized, for each `x` in `test_cases`. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` or `test_cases`.
