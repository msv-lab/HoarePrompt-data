Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, each with a different integer value `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of an array `a`. The function returns the result for each test case, but the specific return values are not provided in the problem description.**
