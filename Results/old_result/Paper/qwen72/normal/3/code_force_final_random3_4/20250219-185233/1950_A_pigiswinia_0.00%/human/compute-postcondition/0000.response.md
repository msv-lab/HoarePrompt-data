Output State: **The function should be called in a loop where the loop runs `t` times, with `t` being a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each iteration, the function should receive three digits `a`, `b`, `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9. `t` is now an integer provided by the user.**
