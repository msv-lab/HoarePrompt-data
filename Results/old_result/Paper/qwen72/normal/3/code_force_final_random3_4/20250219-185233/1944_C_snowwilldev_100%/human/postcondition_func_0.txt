The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers `a` of size `N`, where each integer `a_i` is in the range (0 â‰¤ a_i < N). The function counts the occurrences of each integer in the list using a `defaultdict`. It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` and returns the first integer `i` that either appears exactly once in the list or is missing from the list, provided that no more than one other integer has appeared exactly once before `i`. If no such integer is found, the function returns `N`.
