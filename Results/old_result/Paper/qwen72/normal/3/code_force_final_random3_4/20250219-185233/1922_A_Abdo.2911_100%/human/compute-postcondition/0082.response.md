Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, `possible` retains its initial value, and the program continues. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains True, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
