Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`).
- `j` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so the `print` function will print all the integers in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Output:
- The `print` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the variable n, and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to n)**
