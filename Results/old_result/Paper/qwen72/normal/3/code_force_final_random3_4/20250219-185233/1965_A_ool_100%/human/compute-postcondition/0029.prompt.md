You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of arr is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'.
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1.
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `A` is either True or False depending on the number of iterations and whether the loop was broken; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is False if any two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1, otherwise `not_c` is True; `i` is the last index of `set_` that was checked, which could be less than `len(set_) - 1` if the loop was broken, or `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completed all iterations.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `A` is either the opposite of its previous value if `not_c` is True, or remains unchanged if `not_c` is False; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is True if no two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1, otherwise it is False; `i` is the last index of `set_` that was checked, which could be less than `len(set_) - 1` if the loop was broken, or `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completed all iterations.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. `A` is either the opposite of its previous value if `not_c` is True, or remains unchanged if `not_c` is False. `not_c` is True if no two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1, otherwise it is False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and always returns the string 'Alice'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'Alice'.

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. `A` is either the opposite of its previous value if `not_c` is True, or remains unchanged if `not_c` is False. `not_c` is True if no two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1, otherwise it is False.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
