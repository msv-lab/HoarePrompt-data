### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice, given the rules of the game and the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

1. **Understanding the XOR Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position being set is even.

2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - Eve's goal is to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as many times as possible.
   - The key observation is that the XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the total count of numbers that contribute to each bit position (1, 2, 4) is even.
   - Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can analyze their contributions to the XOR:
     - 1 contributes to the 1st bit.
     - 2 contributes to the 2nd bit.
     - 3 contributes to both the 1st and 2nd bits.
     - 4 contributes to the 3rd bit.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula used in the program is:
     ```python
     sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3
     ```
   - Let's break it down:
     - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs of `x` (since each pair of the same number will cancel out in XOR).
     - `3 * (x // 2)` counts the number of pairs, and each pair can be removed to make the XOR zero.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2, which is 1 if `x` is odd and 0 if `x` is even.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` adds 1 to the sum if `x` is odd and `i` is less than 3 (i.e., for the counts of 1, 2, and 3).
     - The sum is then divided by 3 to get the final result.

4. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - The formula `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is designed to count the number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.
   - For each `p_i` (count of 1, 2, 3, or 4), the number of pairs (`x // 2`) is counted, and each pair can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - If `p_i` is odd and `i < 3` (i.e., for 1, 2, and 3), an additional 1 is added to the sum, which accounts for the fact that removing one of these numbers can also make the XOR zero.
   - Dividing the sum by 3 gives the maximum number of times Bob can win, as each win involves making the XOR zero, which is achieved by removing pairs or a single odd number.

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the input `1 1 1 0`, the formula calculates:
     - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
     - Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3
     - Result = 3 // 3 = 1
   - This matches the expected output.

   - For the input `0 9 9 9`, the formula calculates:
     - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
     - `3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 4 + 1 = 13`
     - `3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 4 + 1 = 13`
     - `3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 4 + 0 = 12`
     - Sum = 0 + 13 + 13 + 12 = 38
     - Result = 38 // 3 = 12
   - This matches the expected output.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by removing numbers optimally. The formula used is mathematically sound and matches the expected results for the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
