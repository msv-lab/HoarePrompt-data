### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `inp`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `la` and `lb` are initialized to `n + 1`. These variables are used to keep track of the smallest and second smallest elements in the array.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the minimum possible penalty.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through each element `i` in the array `inp`.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `la`, it updates `la` to `i`.
   - If `i` is greater than `la` but less than or equal to `lb`, it updates `lb` to `i`.
   - If `i` is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it updates `la` to `lb` and `lb` to `i`, and increments `ans` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum possible penalty for that test case.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but does not perform any actions and is not called anywhere in the program. Therefore, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm aims to minimize the penalty by ensuring that the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences `s` and `t` is minimized.
- By keeping track of the smallest and second smallest elements (`la` and `lb`), the program ensures that any element greater than both `la` and `lb` will be placed in a subsequence where it does not form an increasing pair with the previous elements.
- The penalty is incremented only when an element is greater than both `la` and `lb`, which is a valid approach to minimize the penalty.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `5 1 2 3 4 5`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: The optimal split is `s = [2, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `2 + 1 = 3`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `8 8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3`
  - Output: `1`
  - Reason: The optimal split is `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `0 + 1 = 1`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5 3 3 3 3 3`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The optimal split is `s = []` and `t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The optimal split is `s = []` and `t = [1]`, resulting in a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `2 2 1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The optimal split is `s = [1]` and `t = [2]`, resulting in a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for each test case. The function `func_1` is irrelevant and does not affect the program's correctness.

### Correctness:
**True**
