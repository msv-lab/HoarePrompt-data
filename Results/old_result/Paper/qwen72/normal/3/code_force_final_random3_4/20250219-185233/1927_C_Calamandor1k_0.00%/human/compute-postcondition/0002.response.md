Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `_` is still a placeholder for the loop.
