Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 or 3, `same` is 1 or 2, and `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` in `ar`. Additionally, `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 or 3, and `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` in `ar`. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 4 or 5, `same` is 1, and `num` is equal to the element at index `i` in `ar`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5, `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 or 4, and `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i-1` in `ar`. If `ar[i-1]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 6 or 7, `same` is 1, and `num` is equal to the element at index `i-1` in `ar`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
