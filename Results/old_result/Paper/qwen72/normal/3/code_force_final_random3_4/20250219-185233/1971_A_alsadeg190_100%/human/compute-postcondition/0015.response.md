Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` must be greater than 1.

When the `print(x, y)` statement is executed, it will print the values of `x` and `y` as they were input by the user. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

- `x` is an integer greater than 1.
- `y` is an integer with no specific condition provided.

Therefore, the output will be the values of `x` and `y` as input by the user, where `x` is an integer greater than 1 and `y` is any integer.

Output: **x, y (where x is an integer greater than 1 and y is any integer)**
