Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `a[1]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The previous updates to `k`, `a[0]`, and `a[1]` are still valid and remain part of the output state.
