The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`**
