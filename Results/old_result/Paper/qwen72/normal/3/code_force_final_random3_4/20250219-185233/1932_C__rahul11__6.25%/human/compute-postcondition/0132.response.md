Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is incremented by 1. If the first element of `s` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is decremented by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`.***
