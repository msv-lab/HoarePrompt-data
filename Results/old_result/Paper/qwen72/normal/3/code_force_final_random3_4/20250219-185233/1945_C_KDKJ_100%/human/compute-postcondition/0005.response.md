Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `func_1()` has been called.**

The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 2. The code snippet `func_1()` calls the function `func_1`, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine any changes to variables or the return value. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the addition that `func_1()` has been called.
