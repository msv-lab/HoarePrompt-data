The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the constant `30`, so we can only adjust `i`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `30`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `length` is 30. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and it must still be less than `30`.

State: **`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `x` is an input integer. If the least significant bit (bit at position 0) of `x` is 1, `s` is a list containing the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing the string '0'. If the bit at position 1 of `x` is 1, `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0' followed by '1'. If the bit at position 1 of `x` is 0, `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0' followed by '0'.**
