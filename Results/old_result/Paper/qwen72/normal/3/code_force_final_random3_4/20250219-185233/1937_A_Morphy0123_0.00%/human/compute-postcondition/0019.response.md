Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer not equal to 1, and `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. If `power` is equal to `n`, the current value of `power` remains `n`. Otherwise, `power` is set to the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` minus 1.***
