Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the last element in `a`, `tmp` is a list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. Additionally, the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negative of the last element of `a` is equal to 2.**
