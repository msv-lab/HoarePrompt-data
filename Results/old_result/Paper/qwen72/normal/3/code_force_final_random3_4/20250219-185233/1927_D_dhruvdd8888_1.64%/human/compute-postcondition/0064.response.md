Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The input integer for the loop must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user.
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `tc > 5`.
   - `ppp` is either 23 or not 23.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is very straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement will always print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, `eli`, `tc`, `ppp`, or `arr`.

4. **Output**:
   - The code will print the values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
