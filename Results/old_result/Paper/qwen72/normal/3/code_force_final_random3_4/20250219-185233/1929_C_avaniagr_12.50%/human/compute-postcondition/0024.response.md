Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- The variable `k` remains an input integer between 2 and 30.
- The variable `x` remains an input integer between 1 and 100, and it is still greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`.
- The variable `a` remains an input integer between 1 and 10^9.
- The variable `z` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After `x + 1` iterations, `z` will be `x + 1`.
- The loop variable `i` will have iterated from 0 to `x`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `x`.
