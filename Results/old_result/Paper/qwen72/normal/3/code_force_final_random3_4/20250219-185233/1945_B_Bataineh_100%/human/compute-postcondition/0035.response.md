The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. Here, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers. The constraints for these parameters are as follows: `1 <= t <= 10^4` and `1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18`.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it is expected to return some result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `a`, `b`, and `m` within the range 1 to 10^18. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
