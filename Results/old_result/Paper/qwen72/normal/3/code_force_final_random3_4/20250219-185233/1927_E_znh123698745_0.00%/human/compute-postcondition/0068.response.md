Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list that now includes the element at the index specified by the last element of `a` in `array`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element from `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the list `answer`. Since the initial state specifies that `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `n` must be greater than 2, the last element of `a` must be a valid index within `array`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `array` remain unchanged.
