You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results of subproblems in `res_dict`.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, where the result is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it tries to split the subarray at different points and computes the sum of the results of these splits plus the MEX of the split point.
   - It also considers the cases where the MEX is applied to the start or end of the subarray.
   - The function returns the maximum possible sum for the subarray.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It first computes the maximum value using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns a single operation if true.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a specific pattern and appends the operation to the result.
   - Otherwise, it recursively tries to find the optimal split that achieves the maximum value and constructs the operations accordingly.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a specific pattern where the elements form a sequence from 0 to the length of the subarray minus 1.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired pattern.
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting the elements to the MEX value and appending the operation to the result.

5. **Issues and Concerns**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation is not explicitly defined in the code. The function `func_1` and `func_2` assume that the MEX value is computed, but there is no function or method to compute the MEX of a subarray.
   - **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` rely on global variables `arr` and `res_dict`, which are not defined in the provided code. This can lead to undefined behavior.
   - **Incorrect MEX Logic**: The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` for computing the MEX and the maximum sum is not correct. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the code does not reflect this.
   - **Recursive Depth**: The recursive depth in `func_1` and `func_2` can be very high, especially for larger subarrays, which might lead to stack overflow or excessive computation time.
   - **Stair Construction**: The `make_stairs` function is intended to construct a specific pattern, but it does not correctly handle the transformation of the subarray to the MEX value.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the MEX calculation and the logic for maximizing the sum of the array. It also relies on undefined global variables and has potential issues with recursive depth and incorrect logic.
