Output State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the sublist `S[1]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the sublist `S[1]`, `rsum` is `n`, `ans` is either -1 or 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` updates the value of `right`.
- `S[-1][1]` refers to the second element of the last sublist in `S`.
- `S[i][1]` refers to the second element of the sublist `S[1]` (since `i` is 1).
- Therefore, `right` is now the difference between the second element of the last sublist in `S` and the second element of the first sublist in `S`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
