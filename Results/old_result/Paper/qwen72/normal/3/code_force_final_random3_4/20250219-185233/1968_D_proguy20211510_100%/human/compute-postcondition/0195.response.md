Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are converted to integers using the `int()` function.
- The values of `i`, `paths`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, and `resb` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- The loop has already completed all iterations, so the state of the loop remains the same.
- The specific values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers, but their exact values are not provided, so we only state that they are integers.
