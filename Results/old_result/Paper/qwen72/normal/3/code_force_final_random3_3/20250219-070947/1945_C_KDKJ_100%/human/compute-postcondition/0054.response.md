Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is 2, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is updated to 2. If this condition is not met, `ans` remains -1 or 0 depending on the initial condition.***
