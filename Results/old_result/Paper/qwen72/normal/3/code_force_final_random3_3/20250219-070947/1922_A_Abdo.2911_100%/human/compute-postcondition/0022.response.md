Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 1, `possible` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `possible` to True, overriding any previous conditions that might have set it to False. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. Therefore, the output state reflects these unchanged values and the new value of `possible`.
