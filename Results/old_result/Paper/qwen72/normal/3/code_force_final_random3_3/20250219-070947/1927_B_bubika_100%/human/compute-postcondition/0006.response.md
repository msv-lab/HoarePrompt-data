The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `s`. The loop's execution depends on the list `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one integer. The variable `i` will take the value of the first integer in `s` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is 0, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the first integer in the list `s`**
