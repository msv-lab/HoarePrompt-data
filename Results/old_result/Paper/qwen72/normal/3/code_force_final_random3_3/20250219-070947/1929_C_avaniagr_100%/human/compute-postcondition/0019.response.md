The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`. If `i` is less than `x - k + 3`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `x - k + 3` is greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1
- The expression `x - k + 3` must still be greater than `i`, so `x - k + 3` must be greater than 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`, `x` is already greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is 1, `x - k + 3` is greater than 1**
