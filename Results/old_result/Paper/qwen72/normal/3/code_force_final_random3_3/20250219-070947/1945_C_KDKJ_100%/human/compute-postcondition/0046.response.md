To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters.
- `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists.
- `left` is `S[1][0]`.
- `lsum` is 1.
- `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`.
- `rsum` is `n - 1`.
- The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` determine whether to continue to the next iteration.
- If `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to 1.
- If `abs(n / 2 - i) >= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, `ans` remains -1 or 0 depending on the initial condition.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` remains the same as it is a non-negative integer and is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables (`a`, `S`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is -1 or 0 depending on the initial condition.**
