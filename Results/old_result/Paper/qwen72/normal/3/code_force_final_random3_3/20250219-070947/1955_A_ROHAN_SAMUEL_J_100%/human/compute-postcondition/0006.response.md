Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not used in the print statement.
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `n` is odd.
   - `a` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
   - `b` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
   - `_` is 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
   - `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(n // 2 * b + a)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be the largest integer less than or equal to \( \frac{n}{2} \). For example, if `n` is 5, then `n // 2` is 2.
   - `n // 2 * b` multiplies the result of the integer division by `b`.
   - `n // 2 * b + a` adds `a` to the result of the multiplication.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - Since `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\).
   - The value of `b` is an integer between 1 and 30.
   - The value of `a` is an integer between 1 and 30.
   - The expression `n // 2 * b + a` will be the sum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \times b\) and `a`.

Given the constraints, the output will be a specific integer value based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **\(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \times b + a\) (where \(n\) is an odd integer between 1 and 100, \(a\) is an integer between 1 and 30, and \(b\) is an integer between 1 and 30 such that \(2 \times a \geq b\))**
