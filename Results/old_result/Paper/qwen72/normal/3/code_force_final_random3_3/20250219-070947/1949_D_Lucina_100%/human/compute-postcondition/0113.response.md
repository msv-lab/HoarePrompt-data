The code snippet `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. The value of `i` is 1, and the list `sa` is updated to include this value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `a[1]` and `b[1]` are both 0, and `sa` is a list that now includes the value 1.**
