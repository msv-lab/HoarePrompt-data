Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100.
- The list `arr` remains a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9.
- The value of `left` remains 1.
- The value of `right` remains `n - 2`.
- The code appends the element at index `right` (which is `arr[n - 2]`) to `new_arr`. Since the initial state specifies that if `left` is not equal to `right`, `new_arr` already contains the first element of `arr` (`arr[0]`), and the last element of `arr` (`arr[n - 1]`), the new state of `new_arr` now includes these two elements plus the element at index `right`.
