Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer between 0 and 26 (exclusive), `j` is 0.**

The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`, where `lex` was initially an input integer greater than 26 but less than 52. Therefore, the new value of `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 26 (exclusive). The values of `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `j` remain unchanged.
