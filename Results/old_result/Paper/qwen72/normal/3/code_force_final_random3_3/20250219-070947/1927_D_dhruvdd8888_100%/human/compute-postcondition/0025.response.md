Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, each tuple in the form `(1 + s, i, num)` where `s` is the start index of the range and `i` is the end index of the range. `s` is `N`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
