Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18) from the input. The function then prints the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case. After `t` iterations, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that `t` iterations have been performed, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the ones from the last test case. **
