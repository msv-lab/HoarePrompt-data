Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is `=`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.** 

The value `1` is appended to the list `arr`, which was initially `[0]`, making `arr` now `[0, 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
