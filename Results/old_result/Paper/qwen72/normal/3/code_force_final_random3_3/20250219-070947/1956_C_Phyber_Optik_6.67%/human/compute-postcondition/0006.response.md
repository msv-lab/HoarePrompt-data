Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 0, `r` is 1, `i` is 1, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**

The value of `r` is now 1, as it has been assigned the value of `i`, which was 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
