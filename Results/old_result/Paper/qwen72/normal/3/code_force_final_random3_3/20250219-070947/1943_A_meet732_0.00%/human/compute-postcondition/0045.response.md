The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the list `a` must be considered.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will now be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least three elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `j` and `c` are not affected, `i` is the third element in the list `a`.**
