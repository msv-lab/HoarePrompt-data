Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `num` is `-1`, `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`, `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` and `r` are input integers, `tc` is greater than 5. If `ppp` is 23, the postcondition retains all the initial conditions and `ppp` is 23.** 

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
