Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 26]. If the initial `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 26, 26]. If the initial `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing the elements [26, 1, 26] or [26, 26, 26] depending on whether the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26 or greater than 26 and less than 52, respectively.***
