Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` is a list that includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` is a list that now includes `u` as one of its elements.**

The code snippet `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `u` and `v`, and does not affect the other variables or conditions. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `u` and `v` now being the specific input integers.
