Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[3][0]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the string containing the character at the position `xx[3][0]` followed by 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or followed by 'F' otherwise. If `xx[3][0]` is equal to '?', `nx` is 'SS' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, and `nx` is 'FF' otherwise.***
