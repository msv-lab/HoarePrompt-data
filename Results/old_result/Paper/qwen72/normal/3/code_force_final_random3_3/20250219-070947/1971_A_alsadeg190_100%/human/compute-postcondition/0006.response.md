Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x` in that order. Since `x` and `y` are input integers and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, but we know their relationship.

Output: **y, x (where y is the value of y and x is the value of x, and x is greater than or equal to y)**
