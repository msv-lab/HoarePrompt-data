Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, and `x` is the first character of the list `s`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of the list `s` and the count of `x` in the list `s` is `n - 1`, then if `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` (i.e., `s[(n - 1) // 2]`) is not equal to `x`, the middle element is not `x`. Otherwise, either `n` is even, or the middle element of `s` is `x`.***
