Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `res` is 0. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.** 

The code snippet `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0, but it does not affect the other variables or conditions. Therefore, the initial state remains valid with the addition of `res` being 0.
