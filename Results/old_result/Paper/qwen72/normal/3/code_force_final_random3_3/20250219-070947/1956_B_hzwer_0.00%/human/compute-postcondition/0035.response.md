Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `dp[i][j]` is now the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The count of the value `j + 1` in the list `cards` is exactly 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- `i` is `n - 4` and `j` is `n - 1`.
- The dimensions and initialization of `dp` remain unchanged.
- The count of `j + 1` in `cards` remains exactly 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
