Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. However, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Fireworks Visibility**:
   - The program calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`. This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.
   - The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when both installations launch a firework at the same time. This is because the LCM will give the time when both installations launch a firework simultaneously, which is a critical point for determining the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

2. **Overlapping Fireworks**:
   - The program does not handle the case where fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time. For example, if both installations launch a firework at the same time, the program will count them separately, leading to an incorrect result.
   - The correct approach should consider the overlap and ensure that the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is calculated correctly.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `6 7 4`, the program outputs `2`, which is correct because the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is 2 (one from each installation at minute 7).
   - For the input `3 4 10`, the program outputs `7`, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 7 because the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is 7, occurring at minute 12 (3 from the first installation and 4 from the second installation, plus one overlap).
   - For the input `7 8 56`, the program outputs `17`, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 17 because the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is 17, occurring at minute 112 (9 from the first installation and 8 from the second installation, plus one overlap).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks, we need to calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility window and then account for the overlap.
   - The correct formula to use is:
     - Calculate the number of fireworks launched by the first installation: `A = (m + a) // a`
     - Calculate the number of fireworks launched by the second installation: `B = (m + b) // b`
     - Calculate the number of overlapping fireworks: `overlap = (m + lcm(a, b)) // lcm(a, b)`
     - The maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is `A + B - overlap + 1` (since the overlap is counted twice).

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap and does not use the correct formula to determine the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

Correctness: **False**
