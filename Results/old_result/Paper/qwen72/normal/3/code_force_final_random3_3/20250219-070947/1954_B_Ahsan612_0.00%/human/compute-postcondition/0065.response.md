The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len(ar)`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `len(ar)`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than the current value of `i`**
