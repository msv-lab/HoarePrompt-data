Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` is greater than or equal to 0, and `count2` remains unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is less than or equal to `count`, `done` remains unchanged.***
