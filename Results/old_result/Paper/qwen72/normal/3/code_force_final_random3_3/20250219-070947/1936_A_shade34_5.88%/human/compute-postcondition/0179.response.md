Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.***
