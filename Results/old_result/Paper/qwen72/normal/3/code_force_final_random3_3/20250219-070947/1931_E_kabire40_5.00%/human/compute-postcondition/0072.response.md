Output State: **`y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `y` remains unchanged at 1.
- The `operational_list` still contains the same number of strings as it did initially.
- The variables `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, as they were initially.
- The variable `rev_res` is a string that concatenates all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string.
- The variable `rev_val` is a list that contains the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string.
