Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Parameters and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it should. The function should take `n` and `arr` as parameters. This is a critical issue because the function needs to process different arrays for each test case, and the current implementation does not allow for that.

2. **Logic for Identifying Non-Beautiful Arrays**: The logic for identifying the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only checks the consecutive occurrences of the first element and updates `ans` accordingly. This approach does not consider the general case where the array might have different patterns of beautiful sequences. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the first element is `1`, and the program will only check the consecutive `1`s at the beginning, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

3. **Handling All Elements Being the Same**: The program correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same by printing `-1`. However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is not robust enough to handle all other cases.

4. **Use of `Decimal`**: The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler integer value like `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9`.

5. **General Approach**: The correct approach should involve checking for the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property. This can be done by iterating through the array and identifying the longest subarray where the beautiful property holds, and then determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break this property.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
