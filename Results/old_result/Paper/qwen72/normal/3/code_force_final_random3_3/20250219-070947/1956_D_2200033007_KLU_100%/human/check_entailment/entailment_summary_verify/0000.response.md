### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the MEX operation as required by the problem. Let's break down the issues and validate the assessment using the provided function summaries and the problem description.

1. **MEX Calculation Missing**:
   - The problem requires computing the MEX of a subarray and then setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX value.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the operations. However, it does not compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it seems to be trying to maximize the sum by recursively breaking down the array and calculating potential sums, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum sum of the array for a given subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.
   - It uses a dynamic programming approach to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, but it does not correctly simulate the MEX operation.
   - The function calculates the sum of the subarray in a way that does not reflect the MEX operation, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It relies on the results from `func_1` to determine the operations, but since `func_1` does not correctly compute the MEX, the operations generated by `func_2` will also be incorrect.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is intended to transform a subarray into a sequence where all elements are set to `i`.
   - It checks if the subarray already forms a sequence from 0 to `i` and, if not, transforms it.
   - However, this function is not used in a way that aligns with the MEX operation. It is called in a specific context within `func_2`, but it does not handle the general case of computing the MEX and setting the subarray to the MEX value.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:

- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  1 100 2 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  105 2
  3 3
  3 4
  ```

- **Program Behavior**:
  - The function `func_1` will not correctly compute the MEX of the subarrays [2] and [2, 1].
  - The function `func_2` will generate operations based on the incorrect results from `func_1`.
  - The function `make_stairs` is not used in a way that would correctly handle the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle the MEX operation, which is a fundamental part of the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not align with the problem's requirements, and the function `make_stairs` is not used appropriately to achieve the correct solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not compute the MEX of subarrays and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
