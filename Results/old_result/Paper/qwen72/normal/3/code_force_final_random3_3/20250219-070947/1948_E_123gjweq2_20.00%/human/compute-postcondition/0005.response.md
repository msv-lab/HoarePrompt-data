Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `i` is 0, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr[left + i] = small_element + i` updates the element at the index `left + i` in the array `arr`. Given that `i` is 0, the index `left + i` is `left`. The value assigned to this index is `small_element + i`, which is `left + 1 + 0`, simplifying to `left + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
