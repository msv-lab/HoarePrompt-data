Postcondition: ***`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `v1` and `v2` are the first and second values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2` (now `len(vx) - 1` since `v1` has been removed), and `v2` is less than or equal to 0***
