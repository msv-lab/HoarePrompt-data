#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a callable function.
def func_1(func):
    d = {}
    return wrapper
    #The program returns a callable function named 'wrapper'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a callable function `func` as a parameter and returns a new callable function named `wrapper`. The function `func_1` does not modify the input `func` or any other external state; it simply creates and returns the `wrapper` function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of arguments that can be passed to the function `func`, and `d` is a dictionary used for memoization where the keys are tuples of arguments and the values are the results of `func` for those arguments.
def wrapper():
    if (args not in d) :
        d[args] = func(*args)
    #State: *`args` is a tuple of arguments that can be passed to the function `func`, and `d` is a dictionary used for memoization where the keys are tuples of arguments and the values are the results of `func` for those arguments. If `args` is not in `d`, the current tuple `args` is now a key in the dictionary `d`, and the value associated with `args` in `d` is the result of `func(*args)`. If `args` is already in `d`, the dictionary `d` remains unchanged.
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the value associated with `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` was not already in `d`, the value returned is the result of `func(*args)`, and `args` is now a key in `d` with this result as its value. If `args` was already in `d`, the dictionary `d` remains unchanged, and the value returned is the previously stored result for `args`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `wrapper` does not accept any parameters. It checks if the tuple `args` is a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not in `d`, it calls `func` with the arguments in `args`, stores the result in `d` with `args` as the key, and returns this result. If `args` is already in `d`, it simply returns the value associated with `args` in `d` without modifying the dictionary.

def func_2():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns the first line of input from the user, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads the first line of input from the user, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_3():
    return int(func_2())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of calling the function `func_2()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is the result of calling the function `func_2()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delimiter is a string used to split the input, defaulting to a single space (' ').
def func_4(delimiter):
    return list(map(int, func_2().split(delimiter)))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the `delimiter` and converting each split part to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `delimiter` (a string, defaulting to a single space ' ') and returns a list of integers. This list is obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the specified `delimiter` and converting each split part to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_5():
    return func_2()
    #The program returns the value or output of `func_2()`. Since `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, we do not know its specific output or value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the output of `func_2()`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has the return value of `func_2()`, which is unknown without the definition of `func_2()`.

    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the final value of `ans` is the minimum value of the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` after each iteration of the loop. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` processes three lists `A`, `D`, and `F` to find the minimum value of the maximum difference between two segments of the list `A` after applying a transformation based on elements in `F` and `D`. It first identifies the largest and second-largest differences between consecutive elements in `A`. Then, it iterates over each element in `F`, using binary search on `D` to find the optimal transformation that minimizes the maximum difference. Finally, it prints the maximum of this minimized difference and the second-largest difference found in `A`. The function does not return any value.

    #State: `testcases` must be greater than or equal to 0, `func_6()` has been called `testcases` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a non-negative integer value from `func_3` and uses this value to call `func_6` the same number of times. The function does not return any value, and its primary purpose is to execute `func_6` a specific number of times determined by the result of `func_3`. After the function concludes, `func_6` has been called `testcases` times, where `testcases` is a non-negative integer.
