Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is 1, and `count` is 0 or greater. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues without changing `done`.***
