Based on the initial state provided, we know that `results` is a list with at least three elements, and `result` is the third element in this list.

1. The list `results` has at least three elements.
2. The variable `result` is assigned the value of the third element in the list `results`.

When the `print(result)` statement is executed, it will print the value of the third element in the list `results`.

Output: **result (where result is the third element in the `results` list)**
