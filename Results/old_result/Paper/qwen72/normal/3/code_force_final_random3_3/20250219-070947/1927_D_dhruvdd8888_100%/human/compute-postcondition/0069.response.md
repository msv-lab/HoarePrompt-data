Let's break down the given precondition and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Precondition Analysis:**
   - `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers from the input split.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - If `s > l`, the postcondition remains unchanged.
   - If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, and `LA` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
   - The condition `if s > l` or `if s <= l` does not change the behavior of the `print` statement, as the statement is always printing `-1, -1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output `-1, -1` regardless of the values of the variables or the state of the program.

Output: **-1, -1**
