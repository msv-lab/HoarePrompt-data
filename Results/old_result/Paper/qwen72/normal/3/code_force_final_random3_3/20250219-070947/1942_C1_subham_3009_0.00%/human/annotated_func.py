#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the given problem. It should be defined as `def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y = 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: `t` is 0, and the loop has completed all iterations. For each iteration, `n`, `x`, and `y` were input integers, and `arr` was a list of integers of length `x`. The function printed `x - 2` for each test case.
    #State: *If the script is run as the main module, `t` is 0, and the loop has completed all iterations. For each iteration, `n`, `x`, and `y` were input integers, and `arr` was a list of integers of length `x`. The function printed `x - 2` for each test case. If the script is not run as the main module, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If the script is run as the main module, it reads an integer `t` from the user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user input, followed by a list of `x` integers. The function then prints `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the loop has completed all iterations. If the script is not run as the main module, the function does nothing and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
