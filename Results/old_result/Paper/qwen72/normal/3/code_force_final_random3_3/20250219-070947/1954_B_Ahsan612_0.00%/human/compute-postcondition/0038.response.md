Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `minn` is not equal to infinity.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(minn)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `minn` is defined as the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1.
   - Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it must be a finite value.
   - The minimum of any finite value and 1 will always be 1 (because 1 is the smallest possible value in this context).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `minn` will be 1.

Therefore, the output of the `print(minn)` statement will be:
Output: **1**
