Reasoning:

The task is to choose `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells, \(\mathcal{H}\), is maximized. The program provided attempts to solve this by printing specific cell coordinates for different values of `n`.

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` where \(2 \le n \le 10^3\).

2. **Output for Each Test Case:**
   - The program always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - If `n` is 3, it prints `(2, 3)`.
   - If `n` is greater than 3, it prints `(2, 4)` followed by pairs `(j, j)` for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Analysis of Output:**
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       \[
       |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |1-2| = 1
       \]
     - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which has size 2. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).

   - For \(n = 3\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 3
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       \[
       |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, \quad |1-1| + |1-2| = 1, \quad |1-2| + |1-3| = 3, \quad |1-1| + |2-3| = 2
       \]
     - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has size 4. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

   - For \(n \ge 4\):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 4
       4 4
       5 5
       ...
       n n
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances include:
       - Distances between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \(0, 1\)
       - Distances between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: \(1 + 3 = 4\)
       - Distances between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: \(1 + 2 = 3\)
       - Distances between `(1, 1)` and `(j, j)` for \(4 \le j \le n\): \(|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)\)
       - Distances between `(1, 2)` and `(j, j)` for \(4 \le j \le n\): \(|1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1) - 1\)
       - Distances between `(2, 4)` and `(j, j)` for \(4 \le j \le n\): \(|2-j| + |4-j| = 2(j-2) + 2\)
       - Distances between `(i, i)` and `(j, j)` for \(4 \le i < j \le n\): \(|i-j| + |i-j| = 2(j-i)\)

     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will include all these distances, which are distinct and span a wide range.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - For \(n = 2\), the program correctly outputs a set of coordinates that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the program correctly outputs a set of coordinates that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
   - For \(n \ge 4\), the program outputs a set of coordinates that includes a wide range of distinct Manhattan distances, which is likely to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

However, there is a potential issue with the program:
- For \(n \ge 4\), the program prints `(2, 4)` and then `(j, j)` for \(4 \le j \le n\). This means the coordinates are not always within the grid bounds for \(n < 4\). Specifically, for \(n = 4\), the program prints `(2, 4)`, which is valid, but for \(n = 5\), it prints `(2, 4)` and then `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, which is correct, but for \(n = 6\), it prints `(2, 4)` and then `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(6, 6)`, which is also correct. However, the pattern should be consistent for all \(n \ge 4\).

Given the problem constraints and the need to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the program's approach is generally correct, but it could be improved to handle all \(n \ge 4\) more consistently.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all \(n \ge 4\) in a consistent manner, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions for some values of \(n\).
