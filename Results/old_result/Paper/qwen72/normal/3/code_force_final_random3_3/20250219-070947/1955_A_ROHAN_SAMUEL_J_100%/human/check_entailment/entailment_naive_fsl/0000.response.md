Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than the regular price for two yogurts `2 * a`, but the number of yogurts `n` is odd. In such a case, the program may not always return the minimum cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 5 9
```
- The number of yogurts `n` is 5.
- The price of one yogurt `a` is 5.
- The promotion price for two yogurts `b` is 9.

The correct minimum cost should be:
- Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price: 9 burles.
- Buy 2 more yogurts at the promotion price: 9 burles.
- Buy 1 yogurt at the regular price: 5 burles.
- Total cost: 9 + 9 + 5 = 23 burles.

However, the program will output:
- `n // 2 * b + a` = 2 * 9 + 5 = 23 burles.

This is correct, but consider another case:
```
1
5 5 8
```
- The number of yogurts `n` is 5.
- The price of one yogurt `a` is 5.
- The promotion price for two yogurts `b` is 8.

The correct minimum cost should be:
- Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price: 8 burles.
- Buy 2 more yogurts at the promotion price: 8 burles.
- Buy 1 yogurt at the regular price: 5 burles.
- Total cost: 8 + 8 + 5 = 21 burles.

However, the program will output:
- `n // 2 * b + a` = 2 * 8 + 5 = 21 burles.

This is correct, but the logic is flawed. The program should always check if buying the last yogurt at the regular price is cheaper than buying an extra promotion pack. The correct logic should be to always buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buy the remaining yogurts at the regular price if it is cheaper.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)
```

This ensures that the program always buys the yogurts in the most cost-effective way, regardless of whether `n` is odd or even.
