Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - The value of `arr` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`.
     - If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0]`.
     - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]` and the current value of `res` is '='.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `arr`:**
   - According to the initial state, the current value of `res` is '='.
   - Therefore, `arr` is `[0, 1]`.

4. **Determine the Values of the Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `arr[0]` is the first element of `arr`, which is 0.
   - `i` is 2.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 0 2**
