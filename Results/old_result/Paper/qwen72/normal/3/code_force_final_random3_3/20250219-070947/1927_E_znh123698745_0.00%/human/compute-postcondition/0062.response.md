Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and the last element of `array`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`.
- `a[-1]` is -1, which is the last element of the list `a`.
- `array[-1]` is the last element of the list `array`, which is `n` (since `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive).
- Therefore, `answer` is updated to contain the integers 1 and `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `array`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged.
