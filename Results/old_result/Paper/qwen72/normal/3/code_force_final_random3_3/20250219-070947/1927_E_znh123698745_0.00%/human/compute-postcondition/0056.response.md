Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating pattern starting with 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided.
- `n` is now an input positive integer greater than 1.
- `k` is now an input positive integer.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `array`, `i`, `answer`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
