Output State: **`testcases` must be greater than or equal to 0, `func_6()` has been called `testcases` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `testcases` will be the same as it was initially, but `func_6()` will have been called a total of `testcases` times. If `testcases` was 0, the loop would not have executed at all. If `testcases` was a positive integer, the loop would have executed that many times, with `func_6()` being called once for each iteration.
