Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integer `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1`, which is 1, and `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the element at index `pb - 1` in `vis` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
