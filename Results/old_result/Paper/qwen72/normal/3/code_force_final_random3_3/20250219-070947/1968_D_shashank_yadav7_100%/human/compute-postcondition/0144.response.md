Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0 or the input integer - `n` if `k` never becomes 0, `b` is the value of `p[p[...[p[b] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1), `s` is the value of `p[p[...[p[s] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1), `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over `n` iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over `n` iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over `n` iterations.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0, or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: After the loop, `k` will be 0 if the loop breaks due to `k` becoming 0, or it will be the input integer minus `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0.
- **`b`**: After `n` iterations, `b` will be the result of applying the function `p[b] - 1` `n` times.
- **`s`**: After `n` iterations, `s` will be the result of applying the function `p[s] - 1` `n` times.
- **`sp`**: After `n` iterations, `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` values over the `n` iterations.
- **`bm`**: After `n` iterations, `bm` will be the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the `n` iterations.
- **`sm`**: After `n` iterations, `sm` will be the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the `n` iterations.
- **`bp`**: After `n` iterations, `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` values over the `n` iterations.
