Postcondition: ***`a` is sorted in ascending order and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference is an even number but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value of `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` and `ans` is unchanged. If the difference is not an even number, `ans` is increased by 1.***
