You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function then calculates and prints a value `k` for each test case. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `k = a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, or `k = a + (b + c) // 3` if `(b + c) % 3 == 0`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and the remaining extroverts cannot be paired with universals to form a tent of 3 people. Specifically, the condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:` is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in the tent.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 4 1
```
- There is 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- The introvert will need 1 tent.
- The 4 extroverts need to be in tents of 3 people each. However, 4 % 3 = 1, and there is only 1 universal available, which is not enough to form a tent of 3 people with the remaining extrovert.

The program incorrectly outputs `-1` for this case, but it should output `3` because the 1 universal can be paired with 2 extroverts in one tent, and the remaining extrovert can be paired with the introvert in another tent.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
