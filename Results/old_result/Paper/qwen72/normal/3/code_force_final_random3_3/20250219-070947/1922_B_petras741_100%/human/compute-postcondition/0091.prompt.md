Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the count of how many times the first element of `eta` appears in `w`, `eta_ln` is not equal to 1, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is now the count of how many times the first element of `eta` appears in `w` plus the count of how many times the second element of `eta` appears in `w`, `res` is now `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q1 * (q1 - 1) * (q1 - 2) // 6 + q1 * (q1 - 1) // 2 * rho`, where `q1` is `q[eta[1]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 2, `rho` is the count of how many times the first element of `eta` appears in `w` plus the count of how many times the second element of `eta` appears in `w` plus the count of how many times the third element of `eta` appears in `w`, `res` is now `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q1 * (q1 - 1) * (q1 - 2) // 6 + q1 * (q1 - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, where `q1` is `q[eta[1]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 3, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 3, `rho` is now the count of how many times the first element of `eta` appears in `w` plus the count of how many times the second element of `eta` appears in `w` plus the count of how many times the third element of `eta` appears in `w` plus the count of how many times the fourth element of `eta` appears in `w`, `res` is now `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q1 * (q1 - 1) * (q1 - 2) // 6 + q1 * (q1 - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 6 + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
