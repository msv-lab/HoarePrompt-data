The value of `rep` is set to 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, and `number` remain unchanged. If `k` is 0, `tab` still contains `rep` string elements, and `i` is the last string element in `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string elements, each representing a value of `number` from each iteration, `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop. If `k` is 0, `tab` contains 0 string elements, and `i` is the last string element in `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0.**
