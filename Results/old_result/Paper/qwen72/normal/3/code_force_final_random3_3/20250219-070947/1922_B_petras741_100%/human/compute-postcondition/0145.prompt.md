Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is the number of test cases, an input integer. `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` are each incremented by 1, `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`. Otherwise, `j` is `eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is the sum of the values of `q` at the indices `eta[0]` through `eta[eta_ln - 1]`, and `res` is the sum of the results of `q[eta[k]] * (q[eta[k]] - 1) * (q[eta[k]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[k]] * (q[eta[k]] - 1) // 2 * (rho - q[eta[k]])` for each `k` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, the variables `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` remain undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is less than 3, the variables `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` remain undefined. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and `rho` is the sum of the counts of all elements in `eta` that appear in `w`. If `eta_ln` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `j` is set to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is the sum of the combinations of 3 elements from each `q[k]` (for `k` in `eta`) plus the sum of the combinations of 2 elements from each `q[k]` (for `k` in `eta`) multiplied by the total count of elements in `eta` that appear in `w` before the current element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of all elements in `q` at the indices in `eta`, and `res` is the sum of the combinations of 3 elements from each `q[eta[j]]` plus the sum of the combinations of 2 elements from each `q[eta[j]]` multiplied by the sum of all previous `rho` values if `eta_ln` is greater than 1. If `n` is less than 3, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
