Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated with the values provided by `input().split()`, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `t` are updated based on the input provided. The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The first part updates `n`, and the second part updates `t`. The other variables, `nodes` and `start`, remain unchanged.
