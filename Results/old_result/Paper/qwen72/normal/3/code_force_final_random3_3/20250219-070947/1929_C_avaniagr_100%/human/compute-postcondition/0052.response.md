Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input, and `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input. If `x` == `k - 1`, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `x` must be at least `k - 3`, and `z` is the result of the expression `z + z // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x - k + 3` times, starting with `z = k - 2`. `i` is set to `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.***
