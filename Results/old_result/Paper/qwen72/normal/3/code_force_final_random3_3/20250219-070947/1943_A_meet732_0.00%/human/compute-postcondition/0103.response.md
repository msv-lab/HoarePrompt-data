The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 3, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `c` and `j`.**
