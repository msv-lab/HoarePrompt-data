The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `a` from the user input. The function then counts the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `a`. If the count is 0, greater than 2 and even, or exactly 2 with the first '1' not immediately followed by another '1', it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
