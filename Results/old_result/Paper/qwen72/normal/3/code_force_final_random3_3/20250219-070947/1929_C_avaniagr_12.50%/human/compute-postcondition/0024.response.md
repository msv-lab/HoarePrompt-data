Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, but `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`, `x + 1` must be greater than `x`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates `x + 1` times, as specified by the `range(x + 1)` in the loop.
- In each iteration, `z` is incremented by 1 plus the integer division of `z` by `k - 1`. Since `z` starts at 0 and `z // (k - 1)` is 0 for the first few iterations, `z` is effectively incremented by 1 each time.
- After `x + 1` iterations, `z` will be equal to `x + 1`.
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `x` after the last iteration, which is the final value of `i` when the loop completes.
- The condition `x + 1` must be greater than `x` is always true, as `x + 1` is the number of iterations the loop runs.
