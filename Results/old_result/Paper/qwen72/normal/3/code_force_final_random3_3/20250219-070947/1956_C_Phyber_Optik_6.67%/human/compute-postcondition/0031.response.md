The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `n`, and `r`. So, we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`
- `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists
- `n + r` must be at least 1
- `j` is less than or equal to `n`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `n + r`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `n` remains the same (input integer and must be greater than 0)
- `r` remains the same (last value of `i` that satisfies the condition or 0 if no such `i` exists)

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, `n + r` must be at least 1, `j` is `n + 1`**
