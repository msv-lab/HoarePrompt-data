The function `func` processes a symmetric matrix of characters ('F', 'S', '?', or '.') provided by the user. It reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 24) and `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters. The function then counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column of the matrix. It identifies indices where 'F' or 'S' are exclusively present and appends these indices to lists `sa` and `sb`, respectively. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to `sb`, the function appends indices where both 'F' and 'S' are absent to `sa` and updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'F' for the first `n // 4 - 1` elements in `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise. If the length of `sa` is less than `sb`, it appends such indices to `sb` and updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'S' for the first `n // 4 - 1` elements in `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise. The function prints the updated matrix.
