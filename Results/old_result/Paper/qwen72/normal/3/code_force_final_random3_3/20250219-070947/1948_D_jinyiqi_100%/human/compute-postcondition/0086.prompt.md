You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes a string `s` of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The function should take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s_list` where each string is a test case.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `n - 1`, and `count` is the final count value after all iterations. If `count` equals `j` at any point during the iterations, the program prints `count * 2` and returns. Otherwise, `count` is the number of consecutive successful checks (where `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`) before the loop completes.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `s_list`. It processes each string in `s_list` and returns a value of `count` based on specific conditions involving characters at positions `k` and `k + j` in the string. The function may return nothing, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the conditions, or it may return the value of `j` as `count`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `count` which is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the conditions `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]` are met. If any of these conditions are true, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

Case_3: The program returns the value of `count`, which is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on whether the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` are met. If none of these conditions are met, `count` is 0.

Case_4: The program returns nothing.

Case_5: The program returns nothing.

Case_6: The program does not return any value.

Case_7: The program returns the current value of `count` which is `j`.

Case_8: The program returns nothing.

Case_9: The program returns `count`, which is either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions checked. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
