Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists. Each sublist in `S` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point. The final sublist in `S` will contain the total counts of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`. `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is the sum of the first two elements of the first sublist in `S`, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the first sublist in `S`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration or statement. Otherwise, `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, this condition is retained.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to 1. If `abs(n / 2 - i) > abs(n / 2 - ans)`, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is 2. If `abs(n / 2 - i) > abs(n / 2 - ans)`, `ans` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
