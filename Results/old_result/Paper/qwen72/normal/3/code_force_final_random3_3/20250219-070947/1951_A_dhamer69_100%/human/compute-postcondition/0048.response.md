Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters, the program also behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.**
