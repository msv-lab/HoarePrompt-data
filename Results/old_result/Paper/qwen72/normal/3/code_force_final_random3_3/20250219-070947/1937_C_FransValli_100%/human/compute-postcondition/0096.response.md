The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]` and the current value of `res` is '='.**
