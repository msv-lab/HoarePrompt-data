Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that were less than or equal to `y + 1` at the start of the loop, plus the final value of `y`, and `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and `tmp` may have elements remaining if `y` was not large enough to process all elements in `tmp`.**
