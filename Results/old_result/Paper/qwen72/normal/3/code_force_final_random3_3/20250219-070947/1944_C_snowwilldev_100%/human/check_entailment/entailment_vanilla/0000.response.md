### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to a new array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c` to increase the MEX.
   - Bob should try to prevent Alice from including elements that would increase the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N` to determine the MEX.
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of elements that appear exactly once in `a`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if the current element `i` does not appear in `a`, the function returns `i` as the MEX.

4. **Correctness of the Strategy**:
   - The key insight is that if an element appears exactly once in `a`, Alice can always choose it to include in `c` on her turn.
   - Bob can only remove elements that appear more than once or elements that are not chosen by Alice.
   - The loop in `func_1` correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once and has been chosen by Alice twice (which is not possible since Alice and Bob take turns).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains all integers from 0 to `N-1` exactly once.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players.
   - It correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
