Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is 1.
2. `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
3. `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split.
4. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
5. `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
6. The third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `_`**: Initially, `_` is set to 1. However, the value of `_` is later updated to the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The exact value of `_` after this update depends on the contents of `arr` and the value of `eli`, but this does not affect the `print` statement.
2. **`int(input())`**: This must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not provided. It is only mentioned to ensure that the input is valid for the subsequent operations.
3. **`l` and `r`**: These are integers obtained from the input split. Their exact values are not provided, but they are used to determine `eli`.
4. **`eli`**: This is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. The exact value of `eli` depends on the contents of `arr` and the values of `l` and `r`.
5. **`s` and `e`**: These are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The exact values of `s` and `e` depend on the contents of `arr` and the value of `eli`.
6. **Third element of the tuple at `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**: This value is assigned to `_`, but again, this does not affect the `print` statement.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement will print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the initial state or any changes to the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
