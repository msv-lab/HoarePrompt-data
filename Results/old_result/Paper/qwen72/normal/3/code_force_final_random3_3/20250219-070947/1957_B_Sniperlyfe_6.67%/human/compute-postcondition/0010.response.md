Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `nums` is a list of length `n` where all elements are initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` is now `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all `n` iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The loop index `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
- The list `nums` now contains `n` elements, all of which are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The value of `k` is reduced by `n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, reflecting the total amount subtracted from `k` over all iterations.
