Since the `while` loop is a `while True:` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the initial state of the program. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `pb - 1` which is 1, `i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(len(paths) - 1, k - 1)`, `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer. If `resb` > `ress`, then `resb` is greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**
