### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case using `for ppp in range(tc):`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a dummy value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It then iterates over the array to group consecutive equal elements and stores the ranges and values in `arr`.

3. **Grouping Consecutive Elements:**
   - The loop `for i in range(N + 1):` checks if the current element `nums[i]` is different from the previous element `num`.
   - If they are different, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr`, which represents the range `[1 + s, i - 1]` where all elements are equal to `num`.
   - It then updates `s` to the current index `i` and `num` to `nums[i]`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)` and uses `bisect_left` to find the first range in `arr` that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the range to determine if a pair of different elements exists within the query range `(l, r)`.

5. **Output:**
   - If the start of the range `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1. If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair). Otherwise, it prints `s - 1, s` (a valid pair).
   - If the end of the range `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).
   - If the end of the range `e` is less than `N`, it prints `s, e + 1` (a valid pair).
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).

### Issues and Concerns:
1. **Redundant Input Reading:**
   - The function `func_1` redefines `input` as `sys.stdin.readline`, which is unnecessary and can lead to confusion. The `input` function should be used directly or a different name should be used for `sys.stdin.readline`.

2. **Incorrect Range Handling:**
   - The program appends a dummy value `-1` to `nums` to handle edge cases, but this can lead to incorrect results if the last element of `nums` is also `-1`.
   - The logic for determining the range and checking the conditions is not robust. For example, the condition `if s > l` and `if e >= r` may not correctly handle all cases.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program has some debug prints and special conditions for `ppp == 23` and `tc > 5`, which are not necessary for the problem and can be removed.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm does not correctly handle all possible query ranges. For example, if the query range `(l, r)` is entirely within a single group of equal elements, it will incorrectly print `-1 -1` even if there are different elements outside the group.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues that affect its correctness, particularly in how it handles query ranges and edge cases. The logic for finding pairs of different elements is not robust and can lead to incorrect outputs.

**Correctness: **False****
