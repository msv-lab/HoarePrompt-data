The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. However, the variable `a` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code will raise a `NameError` when trying to access `a[-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 3, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, and a `NameError` is raised.**
