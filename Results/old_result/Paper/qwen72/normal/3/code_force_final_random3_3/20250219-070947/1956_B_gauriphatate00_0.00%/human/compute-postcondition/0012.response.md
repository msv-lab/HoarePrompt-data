The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` is decreased by 1 (since the loop variable `_` is not used, it does not affect the state).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`** 

However, to be precise, we should reflect the change in `t`:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1 from the previous state), `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**
