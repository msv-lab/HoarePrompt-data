Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an even integer, and `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, the length of `s` remains less than 200. If the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200, the length of `s` remains greater than or equal to 200.***
