Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first element of `inp`, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `ans` is 0. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `x` remains `n + 1` and `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is set to 1.***
