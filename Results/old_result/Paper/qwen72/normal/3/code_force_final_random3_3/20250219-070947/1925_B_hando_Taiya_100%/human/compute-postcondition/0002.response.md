The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `x`, and the function `isqrt(x)`. To ensure the loop executes, the range must have at least one value for `i`. The range starts from 1 and goes up to `isqrt(x) + 1`, so `isqrt(x)` must be at least 0. Since `x` is an integer and `1 <= x <= 10^8`, `isqrt(x)` will always be a non-negative integer, ensuring the loop can execute.

However, to be precise, we need to ensure that `isqrt(x)` is at least 1, because if `isqrt(x)` is 0, the range will be from 1 to 1, which will still execute once. But for the loop to make sense and iterate over more than one value if `x` is greater than 1, `isqrt(x)` should be at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `x` is at least 1, and `i` starts at 1. The variable `ans` and `t` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
