To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(mdx, n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `mdx` to `n-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1.
- `n` is the new input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `i` is `mdx`.
- If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

Let's break it down:
1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mdx`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `mdx + 1`.
2. **`mdx`**: This value is set once and does not change during the loop.
3. **`n`**: This value is also set once and does not change during the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is `mdx + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1` for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `res`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`, if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1, otherwise `res` remains 0.**
