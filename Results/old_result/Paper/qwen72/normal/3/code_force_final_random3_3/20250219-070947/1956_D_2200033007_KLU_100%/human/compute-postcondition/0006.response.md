Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, `j` is 1, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `is_already_stairs` to `False`, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `start_index`, `arr`, `res`) remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and conditions.
