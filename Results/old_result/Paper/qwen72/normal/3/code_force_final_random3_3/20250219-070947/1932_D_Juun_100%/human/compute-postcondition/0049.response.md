Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in `cards` that have the same suit as `trump` but with one less element (the last element has been removed), `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value set to a non-`None` value, `answers` is a list containing strings, each of which represents a pair of cards that were not trumps and had the same suit, sorted by their ranks and joined with a space. If `trumps` is not empty, `answers` contains a new string that represents a pair of cards where the first card is `rank` followed by `suit` and the second card is the last element of `trumps` followed by `trump`. The list `trumps` is now one element shorter, and `suit` is the next key in the dictionary `suits`, and `rank` is the value associated with the next key in the dictionary `suits`. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.**
