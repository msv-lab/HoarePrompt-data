The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and returns a sorted list `a_new` of unique elements from `a`. Each element in `a_new` starting from index 1 is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list of unique elements. If the length of `a_new` is 1, the function returns a list with a single element, which is the unique element from `a`.
