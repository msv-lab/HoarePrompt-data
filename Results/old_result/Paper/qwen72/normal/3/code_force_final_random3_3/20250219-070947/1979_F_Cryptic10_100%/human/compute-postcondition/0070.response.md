Output State: **`ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the last tuple in `ops`, `p1` or `p2` has `v1` appended to it depending on whether the last value in `p1` is equal to `v2`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on a condition.
- If the last value in `p1` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `ops`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
- The state of `p1` or `p2` is updated by appending `v1` to it.
