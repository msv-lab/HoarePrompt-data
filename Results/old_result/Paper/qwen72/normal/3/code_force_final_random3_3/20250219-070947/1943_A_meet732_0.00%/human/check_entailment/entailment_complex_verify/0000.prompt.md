You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. For each test case, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the output is 0. Otherwise, the output is the first index `j` in the range 1 to `n` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists. The loop has printed the output for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function prints a result based on the following criteria: If the integer 0 does not appear in the list, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the smallest index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where the integer `j` appears fewer than 2 times in the list, or `n` if no such index exists. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` contains no elements that are `0`. According to the problem description, if the array `a` does not contain `0`, the MEX of the final array `c` should be `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array. However, the program incorrectly checks `cntl[0]` to determine if `0` is present, and if `cntl[0] == 0`, it prints `0` immediately, which is incorrect.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4

Output:
0
```

In this case, the array `a` does not contain `0`, so the MEX of the final array `c` should be `0`. However, the optimal play would involve Alice and Bob picking elements in such a way that the MEX of `c` is actually `1` (since `0` is not in the array, and the smallest non-negative integer that can be excluded is `1`).

The correct approach should be to find the smallest integer `k` such that `k` appears fewer than twice in the array `a`, and then determine the MEX based on the optimal strategy of Alice and Bob. The program's logic for handling this is flawed, leading to incorrect results for certain cases.
