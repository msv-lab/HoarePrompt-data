Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix using a series of operations that involve permutations. The key points to consider are:

1. **Understanding the Operations**:
   - **Type 1 Operation**: Assigns a permutation to a row.
   - **Type 2 Operation**: Assigns a permutation to a column.

2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations of \( 1 \) to \( n \) is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). This is because each permutation of \( 1 \) to \( n \) sums to \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), and there are \( n \) such permutations in the matrix.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) and checks if \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is greater than \( i \times n \). If true, it adds \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) to `sum` and sets `r` to \( i \). Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to `sum`.
   - It prints the total `sum` and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations:
     - For the first \( n \) operations, it prints Type 1 operations for each row, using the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
     - For the next \( r \) operations, it prints Type 2 operations for each column, using the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The logic for determining `r` and `sum` is incorrect. The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not necessary and does not contribute to maximizing the sum. The sum should always be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), and the number of operations should be \( n \) (one for each row) plus \( n \) (one for each column), totaling \( 2n \).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to simply fill each row with the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) and each column with the same permutation. This ensures that each element in the matrix is a distinct integer from 1 to \( n \), and the sum is maximized.

Given the issues in the program's logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
