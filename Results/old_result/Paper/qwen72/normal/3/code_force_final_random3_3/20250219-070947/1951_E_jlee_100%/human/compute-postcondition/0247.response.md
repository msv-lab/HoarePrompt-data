To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is set to 1, and `done` is set to `True` if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Analysis:
1. **`count` is greater than 0**: This means that the condition `count < 1` is never true, so the block of code that sets `count` to 1 and checks the `done` condition will never be executed.
2. **`s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1**: Since `count` is already greater than 0, this condition is irrelevant.
3. **`s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1**: Since `count` is greater than 0, this condition is always true, and the program will continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the above conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will be executed regardless of the values of `s[j]` and `x` because the loop will continue as long as `count` is greater than or equal to 1, which it is.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
