Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1` and `v3`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `v1` and `v2` are the first and second values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 1`, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument 0.**

Explanation:
- `vx` initially contains integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1`.
- `v3` is removed from `vx`, so `vx` now contains integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1` and `v3`.
- `ops` remains an empty list.
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.
- `v1` and `v2` are still the first and second values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 1`, but `len(vx)` is now one less than before because `v3` was removed.
- `v2` is still less than or equal to 0.
- `v3` is still the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument 0.
