### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each case.

2. **Clique Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`. This is correct because the number of cliques needed is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`.

3. **Array Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n` with zeros. This is necessary to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - The function `make_array` is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and determining their clique membership.
   - The function takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` as `left + 1` and `right + 1`, respectively.
   - It then calculates `mid` and `not_mid` to divide the range `[left, right]` into two parts.
   - The first loop assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` to the first half of the range and sets the corresponding clique membership.
   - The second loop assigns values from `big_element` to `big_element - not_mid + 1` to the second half of the range and sets the corresponding clique membership.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the assigned values `arr`, the number of cliques `cliques`, and the clique assignments `cliquess`.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the output: the `cliquess` array is not being updated correctly in the `make_array` function. The `cliquess` array should reflect the correct clique assignments, but it is being printed as a sequence of zeros.

### Correctness:
- **False**

### Explanation:
- The `cliquess` array is not being updated correctly in the `make_array` function. The lines `cliquess[left + i] = clique` and `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` are inside the function but are not being executed as intended. As a result, the `cliquess` array remains a list of zeros, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1, arr, cliquess)
        
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(left, right, clique, arr, cliquess):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The `make_array` function now takes `arr` and `cliquess` as additional parameters.
- Inside the `make_array` function, the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are updated correctly.
- The main loop in the test case handler now passes the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays to the `make_array` function, ensuring that the clique assignments are correctly reflected in the `cliquess` array.

This corrected version should now produce the correct output for the given problem.
