Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`, `i` is `n-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged, still within the range 2 to 100.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged, still a sorted list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9.
- The variables `left` and `right` are not modified within the loop and remain `n` and `-1` respectively.
- The list `new_arr` remains unchanged, still containing the elements of `arr` in a mirrored order.
- The variable `max_beauty` is updated to be the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr`. This means that after the loop completes, `max_beauty` will contain the total "beauty" of the sequence, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between each adjacent pair of elements in `new_arr`.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (inclusive).
