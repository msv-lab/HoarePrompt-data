Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `b` is a list where the element at index `x` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `r` is the empty string if `x` is -1, otherwise `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in `a`, `i` is the first element in `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in `b` (which is -1 if `i` is not found in `b`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `b` is a list where the element at index `x` (the index of the second element in `b` or -1 if not found) is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements, `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in `a` (if `x` is not -1), `i` is the second element in `s`, `x` is the index of the second element in `b` (which is -1 if the second element is not found in `b`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `b` is a list where the element at index `x` (the index of the third element in `b` or -1 if not found) is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in `a` (if `x` is not -1) concatenated with the character at index `x` in `a`, `i` is the third element in `s`, `x` is the index of the third element in `b` (which is -1 if the third element is not found in `b`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
