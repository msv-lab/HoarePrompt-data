Postcondition: ***`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 1. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `a` or `b`, `possible` remains unchanged. If the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a` or `b`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
