- `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `count2` is greater than `count`.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `done` is set to True.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.
