Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 3, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 2, `arr` must contain at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- `residue_map` contains `current_key` mapped to 2.
- `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.
- Since `current_key` is in `residue_map`, `count` is incremented by 2.
- The initial value of `count` is 1, so after the increment, `count` becomes 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
