The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list `tab` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `tab` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations
- `k` is a positive integer that has been reduced by the sum of all `Min` or `Max` values subtracted from it over the iterations, and `k` is currently 0
- `rep` is 60 or less
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations

To ensure the loop executes, `tab` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will be the first element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations, `k` is currently 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `tab`**
