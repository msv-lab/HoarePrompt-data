Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. This means `r_x` is the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `arr`, `num`, `r_y`, `current_key`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions are still valid, including the list `test_cases` remaining unchanged, `results` containing the value of `count`, `count` being 0, `residue_map` having `current_key` mapped to 1, `arr` containing at least two elements, `num` being the second element of `arr`, `r_y` being the result of `num % y`, and `current_key` being a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.
