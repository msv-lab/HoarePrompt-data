The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list `a` that has not been processed yet. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must have at least one element, and `i` was set to the last element of `a`.

For the next iteration, `i` will be set to the next element in `a`. Since `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to start, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must contain at least two elements. Therefore, `i` will be set to the second element of `a`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least two elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `j` and `c` are not affected, `i` is the second element in the list `a`**
