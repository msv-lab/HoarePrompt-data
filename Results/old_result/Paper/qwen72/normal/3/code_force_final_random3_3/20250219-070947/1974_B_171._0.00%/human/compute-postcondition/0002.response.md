The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `encoded`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `encoded`. If `encoded` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `mapping` is an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list. For the loop to be executed, `encoded` must have at least one character, and `char` will be the first character in `encoded`.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list**
