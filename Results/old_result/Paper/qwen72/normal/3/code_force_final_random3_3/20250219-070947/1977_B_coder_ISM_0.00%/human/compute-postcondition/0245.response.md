Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `nalla` is 2.
   - `i` is 30.
   - `length` is 30.
   - `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29.
   - The loop has processed each element in the list `s` from index 0 to 28.
     - If any element `s[i]` was '-1' and the previous element `s[i - 1]` was '1', the current value of `s[i]` has been set to '0' and the previous value of `s[i - 1]` has been set to '-1'.
   - If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` was '0' before the loop, then `s[29]` is set to '1' and `flag` is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the state of `s` and `flag` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(length)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `length` is explicitly defined as 30 in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement simply prints the value of `length`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `length` is 30, the `print` statement will output 30.

Output: **30**
