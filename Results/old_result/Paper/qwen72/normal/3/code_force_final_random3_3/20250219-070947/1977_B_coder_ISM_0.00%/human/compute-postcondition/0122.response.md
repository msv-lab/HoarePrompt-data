Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` and `s[1]` are both '1', then `s[0]` is set to '-1', `s[1]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains unchanged, and `flag` is 0.***
