Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `answer` has been updated by appending the integer at the position `a[-1]` in `array`, and `a[-1]` is now `a[-1] - 1`. Otherwise, `answer` is a list that now includes the first element of `array`, and `array[0]` is 2.***
