Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`, `t` is 0.**

The variable `t` is initialized to 0, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `N-1`, `N` remains the same, and the `cnt[a[j]]` values are still incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `N-1`.
