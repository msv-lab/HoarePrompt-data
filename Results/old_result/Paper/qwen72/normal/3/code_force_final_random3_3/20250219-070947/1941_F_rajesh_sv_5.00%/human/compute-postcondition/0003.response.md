The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `testcases`. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, we only need to consider `testcases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be greater than 0. However, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 with each iteration, but since `_` is a placeholder, it does not affect the loop condition directly. The loop condition is solely dependent on `testcases`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, `func_6()` has been called.**
