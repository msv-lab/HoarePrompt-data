Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
- It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

### Analysis:
1. **Conditions on `a`, `b`, and `c`:**
   - The first condition states that it is not true that `a < b` and `b < c`.
   - The second condition states that it is not true that `a < b` and `b > c`.

2. **Implications:**
   - If `a < b` is true, then `b` cannot be less than `c` (from the first condition) and `b` cannot be greater than `c` (from the second condition). This means that if `a < b`, then `b` must be equal to `c`.
   - If `a < b` is false, then the conditions do not provide any further constraints on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The conditions ensure that the relationship `a < b` cannot hold. Therefore, `a` is either greater than or equal to `b`.
   - Since `a` is not less than `b`, the conditions do not impose any specific relationship between `b` and `c`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NONE')
```

### Output:
The code snippet simply prints the string 'NONE'. The conditions on `a`, `b`, and `c` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on the values of these variables.

Output: **NONE**
