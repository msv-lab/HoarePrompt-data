The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0 + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer less than the input integer, `b` is the final value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (where the number of `p` applications is equal to the number of loop iterations), `s` is the final value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1` (where the number of `p` applications is equal to the number of loop iterations), `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and `a[p[s] - 1]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
