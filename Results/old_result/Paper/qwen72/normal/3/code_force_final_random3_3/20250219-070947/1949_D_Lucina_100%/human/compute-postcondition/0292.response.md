Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, and `j` is `n + 1`. Each `nx` string is constructed such that if the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is appended directly to `nx`. If the character is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, `sb` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0. Each `nx` string is constructed such that if the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is appended directly to `nx`. If the character is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
