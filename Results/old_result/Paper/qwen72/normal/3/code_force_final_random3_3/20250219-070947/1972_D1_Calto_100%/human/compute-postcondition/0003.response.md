Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `x` is `n`, `y` is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i * i` to `y`. Since `i` is 1, `y` becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `y`.
