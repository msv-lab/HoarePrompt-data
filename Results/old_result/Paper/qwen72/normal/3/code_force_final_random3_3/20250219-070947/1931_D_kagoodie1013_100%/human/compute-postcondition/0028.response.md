Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The value of `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. Since `num` is the first element of `arr` and `x` is part of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` will hold the result of this calculation. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
