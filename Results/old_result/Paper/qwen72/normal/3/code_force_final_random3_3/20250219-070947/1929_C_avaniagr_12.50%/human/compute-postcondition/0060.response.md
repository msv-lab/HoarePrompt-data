The `print` statement in the given code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `_`, `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **YES**
