Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is a single line with two space-separated integers, `s` is a list of characters from the user input.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` reads a line of input from the user and converts it into a list of characters. The initial state variables `t`, `_`, `arr`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The new variable `s` is now a list of characters corresponding to the input string.
