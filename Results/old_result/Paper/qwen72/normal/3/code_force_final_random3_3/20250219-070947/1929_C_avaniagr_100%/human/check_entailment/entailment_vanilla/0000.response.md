### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place bets in a casino where he wins \( y \cdot (k - 1) \) coins if he wins and loses \( y \) coins if he loses.
   - The casino has a promotion where Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
   - Sasha starts with \( a \) coins and wants to determine if he can guarantee having at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( x \geq k - 1 \), Sasha can always recover from a series of losses because the number of consecutive losses allowed is sufficient to recover the initial bet amount.
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha might not be able to recover from a series of losses, especially if his initial number of coins is too low.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it checks the conditions:
     - If \( x < k - 1 \):
       - Sasha can only guarantee a win if he has at least \( x + 1 \) coins initially.
     - If \( x == k - 1 \):
       - Sasha can only guarantee a win if he has at least \( x + 2 \) coins initially.
     - If \( x > k - 1 \):
       - The program calculates a threshold \( z \) using a loop. This threshold represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee a win.
       - The loop increments \( z \) based on the number of additional losses allowed beyond \( k - 1 \).

4. **Threshold Calculation:**
   - The threshold \( z \) is calculated as follows:
     - Start with \( z = k - 2 \).
     - For each additional loss beyond \( k - 1 \) (i.e., \( x - k + 3 \) times), increment \( z \) by \( z // (k - 1) + 1 \).
   - This calculation is based on the idea that Sasha can recover from a series of losses by placing bets that are multiples of the initial bet amount.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" if Sasha has at least \( z \) coins initially, and "NO" otherwise.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the cases where \( x < k - 1 \) and \( x == k - 1 \).
- The threshold calculation for \( x > k - 1 \) is also correct, as it ensures that Sasha can recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses allowed by the promotion.
- The logic for determining if Sasha can guarantee having at least \( n \) coins is sound and follows the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
