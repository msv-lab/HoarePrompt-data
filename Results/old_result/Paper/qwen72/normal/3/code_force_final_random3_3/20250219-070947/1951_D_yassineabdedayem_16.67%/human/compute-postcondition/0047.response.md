Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations.
   - `k` is currently 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `tab` must have at least three elements.
   - `i` is the third element of `tab`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is defined as the third element of the list `tab`.
   - Since `tab` must have at least three elements, `i` is guaranteed to be a valid index.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `i` is the third element of the list `tab`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[i] (where [i] is the third element of the list `tab`)**
