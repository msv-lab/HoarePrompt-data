The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters.
- `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists.
- `ans` is -1 or 0 depending on the condition.
- `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`.
- `lsum` is 0.
- `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`.
- `rsum` is `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.
- `n` must remain the same, so `n` is still a non-negative integer.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1 or 0 depending on the condition, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n`**
