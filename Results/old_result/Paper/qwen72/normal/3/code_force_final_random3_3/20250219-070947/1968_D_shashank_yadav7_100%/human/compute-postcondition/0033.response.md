The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but their values are still dependent on the initial conditions and the values of `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `sm`, and `bm`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * (k - 3), a[b] * (k - 2) + bp, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k - 3) + sp, a[s] * (k - 2) + sp, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`**
