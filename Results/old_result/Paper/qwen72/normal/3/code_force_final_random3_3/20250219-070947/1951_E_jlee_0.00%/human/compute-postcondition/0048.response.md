The given code snippet is simply `print('YES')`. This statement will print the string `'YES'` to the console. The initial state provides a detailed context about the variables and objects in the program, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the initial state.

Output: **YES**
