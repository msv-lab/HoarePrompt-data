Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` still holds.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.
- `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
   - The condition `b <= a` or `b - a >= n` or `b - a < n` is given.
   - `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

2. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
   - This expression calculates the integer value of the formula \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).

3. **Value of `b` and `n`:**
   - The value of `b` and `n` are not explicitly defined, but we know their relationship based on the conditions provided.
   - If `b <= a`, then `b` is less than or equal to `a`.
   - If `b > a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.

4. **Calculation:**
   - The formula \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\) will yield a different result depending on the values of `b` and `n`.
   - However, since the exact values of `b` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `b` and `n`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of the expression \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) (where b and n are the input integers)**
