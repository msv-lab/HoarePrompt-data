Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 1, `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `j` is the first element of `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to include the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
- Since `s` is a list of zeros, `s[j]` is 0.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `0 + 97`, which is 'a'.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
