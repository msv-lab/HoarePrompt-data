Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 5.
   - `j` is 5.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is converting the integer `j` to a string and concatenating it with a space and another string representation of `j`.
   - Since `j` is explicitly given as 5, the string representation of `j` is `'5'`.
   - Therefore, the expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` will be `'5' + ' ' + '5'`, which results in the string `'5 5'`.

4. **Final Output:**
   Output: **5 5**
