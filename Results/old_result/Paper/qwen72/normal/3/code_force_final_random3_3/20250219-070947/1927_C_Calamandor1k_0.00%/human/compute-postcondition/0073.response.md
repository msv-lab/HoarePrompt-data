Output State: **`i` is `max(len(a), len(b)) - 1`, `max(len(a), len(b))` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len(a), len(b))`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len(a), len(b))`, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` remains unchanged, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`.**
