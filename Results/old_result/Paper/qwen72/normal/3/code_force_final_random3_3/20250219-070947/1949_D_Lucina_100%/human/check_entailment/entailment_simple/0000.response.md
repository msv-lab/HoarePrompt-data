### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and then `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters. These characters can be 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'.
   - The program initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input lines, with an empty string at index 0 to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting Known Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through each input line and updates `a` and `b` based on the characters 'F' and 'S'.
   - The list `xx` is updated to store the input lines.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only 'F' transitions and only 'S' transitions, respectively.
   - This step ensures that the program can later use these scenarios to balance the transitions.

4. **Balancing Transitions:**
   - If the number of scenarios with only 'F' transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only 'S' transitions (`sb`), the program:
     - Adds scenarios with no known transitions to `sa`.
     - For each scenario, constructs a new transition string `nx`:
       - If the transition is already known (not '?'), it is appended directly to `nx`.
       - If the transition is unknown and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`.
       - Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.
   - If the number of scenarios with only 'F' transitions is less than the number of scenarios with only 'S' transitions, the program:
     - Adds scenarios with no known transitions to `sb`.
     - For each scenario, constructs a new transition string `nx`:
       - If the transition is already known (not '?'), it is appended directly to `nx`.
       - If the transition is unknown and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`.
       - Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed transition strings `nx` for each scenario.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry and Input Constraints:**
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix remains symmetric by using the same logic for both `i` and `j` indices.
  - The input constraints are respected, and the program correctly handles the maximum number of known transitions.

- **Balancing Transitions:**
  - The program attempts to balance the transitions by ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transitions of the same type occur consecutively.
  - However, the logic for balancing transitions is flawed. Specifically, the condition `n // 4 - 1` is incorrect because it can result in a negative index, which is not valid. This should be `n // 4` instead.

- **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
  - The program correctly handles undecided transitions by assigning 'F' or 'S' based on the balance condition.
  - However, the balance condition is not robust enough to ensure that the requirement is always met for all permutations of scenarios.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical flaw in the way it balances the transitions, specifically in the condition `n // 4 - 1`. This can lead to incorrect assignments of 'F' and 'S' transitions, potentially violating the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transitions of the same type occur consecutively.

**Correctness: False**
