Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable that is incremented to be one more than its previous value, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`. The function `func_2()` has been called.**

The initial state remains unchanged, and the function `func_2()` has been called, but its impact on the variables or program state is not specified. Therefore, the values of `t` and `_` remain as they were initially.
