Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`. If the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a` and `b`, `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.***
