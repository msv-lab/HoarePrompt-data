The code snippet `mex.append(minn)` appends the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. Given that `minn` is 0, the list `mex` will now contain a single element, which is 0. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `test_cases`, `arr`, `maxx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing [0], `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, and the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is greater than 0.**
