### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1 (to match the 1-based indexing in the problem).

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`**:
   - If there are only 2 friends, the program directly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - This is correct and matches the problem description.

4. **Checking for Cycles**:
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, which means that the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself. This indicates a cycle of length 3.
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints `2` and returns, as inviting any two friends in this cycle will ensure both come to the party.
   - This is a valid approach for detecting cycles of length 3.

5. **Default Case**:
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints `3`.
   - The idea here is that if there are no cycles of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.
   - This is based on the assumption that in the absence of a cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required is 3. However, this assumption is not always correct.

### Analysis:
- **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly identifies cycles of length 3 by checking `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This is a valid approach because if such a cycle exists, inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure both come to the party.
- **Special Case for `n == 2`**: The program correctly handles the special case where there are only 2 friends.
- **Default Case**: The program prints `3` if no cycle of length 3 is found. However, this is not always correct. Consider the case where there are no cycles of length 3 but there are cycles of length 2 (i.e., pairs of friends who are each other's best friends). In such a case, inviting any two friends in a cycle of length 2 will also ensure that both come to the party, and the minimum number of invitations required is 2, not 3.

### Counterexample:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  4
  2 1 4 3
  ```
  - Here, friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends, and friends 3 and 4 are each other's best friends.
  - The program will not find a cycle of length 3 and will print `3`.
  - However, the correct answer is `2` because inviting any two friends from a cycle of length 2 (e.g., friends 1 and 2) will ensure that both come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically incorrect because it does not handle the case where there are cycles of length 2. The default case should be more robust to handle all possible scenarios.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
