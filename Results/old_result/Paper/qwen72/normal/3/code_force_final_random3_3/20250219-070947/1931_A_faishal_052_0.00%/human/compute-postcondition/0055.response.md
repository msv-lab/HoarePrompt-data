Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the element 26, `k` is 2, `lex` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive).**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, and since `lex` was initially an integer greater than 26 and less than 52, the new value of `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive). The states of the other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, `k`) remain unchanged.
