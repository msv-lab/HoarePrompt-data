### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called `t` times, which is correct for handling multiple test cases.
   - The function reads the input for each test case correctly, taking `n` and `k` as integers and `a` as a list of integers.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` iterates through the list `a` to count how many matches your cow can win without any swaps.
   - The condition `if a[i] > a[k - 1]: break` correctly stops the loop when the first cow with a higher rating is encountered.
   - The variable `wins` is incremented for each match won, which is correct.

3. **Output Without Swap:**
   - The condition `if (wins >= k):` checks if the number of wins is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - If true, it prints `wins - 1` and returns, which is correct because the cow can win up to `k-1` matches without any swaps.

4. **Wins Calculation with Swap:**
   - The variable `win_with_swap` is initialized to `wins + 1`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to `wins` because the initial wins are already counted.
   - The loop `for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):` iterates from `win_with_swap` to `k-1` to count additional wins after a potential swap.
   - The condition `if a[i] > a[k - 1]: break` correctly stops the loop when the first cow with a higher rating is encountered after the swap.
   - The variable `win_with_swap` is incremented for each additional match won, which is correct.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is `print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))`.
   - This expression is intended to find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve, either without any swaps or with one swap.
   - However, the expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is incorrect. It should be `win_with_swap - 1` to correctly count the total wins after the swap.

### Correctness:
- The initial wins calculation is correct.
- The output without swap is correct.
- The wins calculation with swap is incorrect due to the initialization of `win_with_swap` and the final output expression.

### Corrected Code:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        wins = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
                break
            wins += 1
        
        if wins >= k:
            print(wins - 1)
            continue
        
        win_with_swap = wins
        for i in range(k, n):
            if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
                break
            win_with_swap += 1
        
        print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - 1))
```

### Correctness: **False**
- The program has logical errors in the wins calculation with a swap and the final output expression. These errors need to be corrected to ensure the program works as intended.
