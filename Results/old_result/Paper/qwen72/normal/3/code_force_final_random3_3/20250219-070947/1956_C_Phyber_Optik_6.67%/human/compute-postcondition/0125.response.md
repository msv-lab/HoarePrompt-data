Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `r` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1`.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` still holds.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n` is greater than 0**: This means `n` is a positive integer.
2. **`r` is a non-negative integer**: This means `r` can be 0 or any positive integer.
3. **`j` is `j + 1`**: This is a bit confusing because it implies a self-assignment, but in the context of the precondition, it seems to be a placeholder for some iterative process. However, it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
4. **Conditions on `j`**: These conditions are provided to ensure that `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` holds true in both cases (whether `j` is less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`). This condition is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.

### What the Code Does:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so each integer in the sequence is printed separated by spaces.

### Output:
Since `n` is a positive integer, the `print` statement will print a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer)**
