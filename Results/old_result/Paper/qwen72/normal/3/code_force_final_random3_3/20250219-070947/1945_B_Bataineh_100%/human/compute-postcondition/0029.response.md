To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 + m // a)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `2 + m // a` involves integer division (`//`), which means `m` is divided by `a` and the result is truncated to the nearest whole number (floor division).
   - The result of `m // a` is then added to 2.

Since `a` and `m` are input integers provided by the user, their exact values are not known. However, the expression `2 + m // a` will be evaluated based on the provided values of `a` and `m`.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression `2 + m // a`.
   - Since `a` and `m` are not explicitly defined, the output will be described in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 + m // a (where m and a are the input integers provided by the user)**
