The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n` and `qs`. The loop iterates over the elements of `qs`, and `n` is updated to the next element in `qs` at the start of each iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `_` is 2
- `k` and `q` are input integers
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element
- `n` is the first element in `qs`
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be the next element in `qs`, and `qs` must still have at least one more element to continue the iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`**
