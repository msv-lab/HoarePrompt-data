Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2**

Explanation:
- The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x` and `y`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
- The precondition that `x` must be greater than 2 is still valid, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are now the integers provided by the input.
