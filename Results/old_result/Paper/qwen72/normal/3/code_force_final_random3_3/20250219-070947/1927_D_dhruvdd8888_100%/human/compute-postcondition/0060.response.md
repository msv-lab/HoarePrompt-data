The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and the result of `int(input())`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`_` is 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`. If `s > l`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.**
