Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the first element of `arr` and the element at index 1 of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and the element at index 1 of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `right` is decremented by 1, changing from `n - 2` to `n - 3`.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, and `left` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `new_arr` is still based on whether `left` is equal to `right`. Now, `right` is `n - 3`, so the condition for `new_arr` is updated accordingly.
