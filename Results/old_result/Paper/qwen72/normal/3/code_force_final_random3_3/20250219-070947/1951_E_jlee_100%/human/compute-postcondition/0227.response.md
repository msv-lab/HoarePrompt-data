To determine what will be printed by the `print(string)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(string)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: It is given that `n` is greater than 0. This means `n` is a positive integer.
2. **Variable `j`**: It is explicitly set to 1.
3. **Variable `count`**: It is given that `count` is greater than 0. This means `count` is a positive integer.
4. **Variable `done`**: The value of `done` depends on the condition `s[0] != s[n-1]`. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, `done` is True. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged (which implies it is False).

5. **Variable `string`**: The variable `string` is not explicitly defined in the initial state or the code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
Since the variable `string` is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet, we cannot determine what will be printed. The output will depend on the value of `string`, which is not provided.

Output: **string (where string is an undefined variable and its value is unknown)**
