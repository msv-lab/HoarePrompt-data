Postcondition: ***`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings, modified as described, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`. If the second element of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`) is '-1' and the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '1', then the second element of `s` is set to '0', and the first element of `s` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.***
