The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3. If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is the initial value of `sum` plus \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is increased by \( i \times n \). If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 + i \times n \) and `r` is 1. If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \), then `sum` is \( 2 \times (i \times n) \) and `r` is 0.**
