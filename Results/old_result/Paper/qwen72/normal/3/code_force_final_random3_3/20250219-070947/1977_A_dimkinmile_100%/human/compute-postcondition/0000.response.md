Output State: **The function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` and `m` are now assigned the values from the input, where the input is a space-separated string of two integers.**
