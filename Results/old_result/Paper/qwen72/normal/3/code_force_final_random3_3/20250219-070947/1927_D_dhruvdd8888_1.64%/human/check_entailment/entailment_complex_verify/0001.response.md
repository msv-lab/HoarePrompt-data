### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case using `for ppp in range(tc):`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`, which is appropriate.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a dummy value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases, which is a reasonable approach to ensure the loop processes the entire array.

3. **Grouping Consecutive Elements:**
   - The loop `for i in range(N + 1):` correctly identifies segments of consecutive equal elements and stores the ranges and values in `arr`.
   - The tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` represents the range `[1 + s, i - 1]` where all elements are equal to `num`.
   - This approach is efficient and helps in quickly finding the segments during query processing.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)` and uses `bisect_left` to find the first range in `arr` that starts at or after `l`.
   - The logic for determining if a pair of different elements exists within the query range `(l, r)` is flawed:
     - The condition `if s > l` and `if s == 1` is incorrect. If `s` is 1, it does not necessarily mean there is no valid pair. It should check if the segment starting at `s` is the only segment in the query range.
     - The condition `elif e >= r` is also incorrect. It should check if the segment ending at `e` is the only segment in the query range.
     - The condition `elif e < N` is not robust. It should check if there are any other segments within the query range that can provide a valid pair.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `-1 -1` if no valid pair is found, which is correct.
   - However, the conditions for finding a valid pair are not correctly implemented, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

### Issues and Concerns:
1. **Redundant Input Reading:**
   - Redefining `input` as `sys.stdin.readline` is unnecessary and can be confusing. It is better to use `input` directly or use a different name for `sys.stdin.readline`.

2. **Incorrect Range Handling:**
   - The logic for determining the range and checking the conditions is not robust. For example, the condition `if s > l` and `if e >= r` may not correctly handle all cases.
   - The program does not correctly handle queries where the range `(l, r)` is entirely within a single group of equal elements.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The debug prints and special conditions for `ppp == 23` and `tc > 5` are not necessary for the problem and can be removed.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm does not correctly handle all possible query ranges. For example, if the query range `(l, r)` is entirely within a single group of equal elements, it will incorrectly print `-1 -1` even if there are different elements outside the group.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues that affect its correctness, particularly in how it handles query ranges and edge cases. The logic for finding pairs of different elements is not robust and can lead to incorrect outputs.

**Final: **False**
