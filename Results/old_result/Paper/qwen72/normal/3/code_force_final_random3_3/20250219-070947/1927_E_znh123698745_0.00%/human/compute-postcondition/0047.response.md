Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, and `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]`, depending on whether `(-1)`, and `answer` now also contains the integer at the index `a[-1]` in `array`.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` adds the integer at the index `a[-1]` in the `array` to the `answer` list.
- The initial state of `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]`, depending on some condition related to `(-1)`.
- After appending `array[a[-1]]` to `answer`, the `answer` list now contains these initial values plus the new value from `array` at the index `a[-1]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `i` remain unchanged.
