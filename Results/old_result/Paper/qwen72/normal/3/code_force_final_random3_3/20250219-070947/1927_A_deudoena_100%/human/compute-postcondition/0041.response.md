Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads two inputs: an integer `m` and a string `s` of length `n` (1 <= n <= 10) consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'. It calculates the distance between the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` and returns this distance plus 2. **
