The loop head in the given code snippet is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer input provided by the user. The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, and it does not affect the loop's execution directly. The only state that can influence whether the loop executes again is the integer input provided by `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `maxi` is 0
- `res` is the last input string
- `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`
- `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists

Since the loop head does not reference any of these variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `res`, `arr`, `mini`), the only state that can be adjusted to determine if the loop should execute again is the user input for `range(int(input()))`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide a positive integer input, as the loop will execute that many times.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the last input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. The loop will execute again if the user provides a positive integer input.**
