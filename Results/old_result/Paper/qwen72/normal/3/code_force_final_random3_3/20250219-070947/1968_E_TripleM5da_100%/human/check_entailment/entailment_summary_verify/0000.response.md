Reasoning: The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not always maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\). The program's approach of printing the first two points as \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), and then printing the remaining points as \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), does not ensure that the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized for all values of \(n\).

Let's analyze the program's behavior for different values of \(n\):

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is correct and optimal for \(n = 2\).

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4. However, the optimal set \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) should be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which has a size of 6. The program fails to achieve this optimal size.

3. **For \(n = 4\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 7. However, the optimal set \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) should be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\), which has a size of 8. The program fails to achieve this optimal size.

4. **For \(n = 5\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 9. However, the optimal set \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\) should be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\), which has a size of 10. The program fails to achieve this optimal size.

5. **For \(n = 6\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     6 6
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which has a size of 11. However, the optimal set \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 6\) should be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}\), which has a size of 12. The program fails to achieve this optimal size.

The function summary confirms that the program always prints the same pattern of points, which does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\). The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect because it does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Final: **False**
