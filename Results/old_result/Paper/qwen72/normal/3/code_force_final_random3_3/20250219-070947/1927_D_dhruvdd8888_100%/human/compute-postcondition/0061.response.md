Output State: **`_` is 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`. If `s > l`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `l` and `r`.
- The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 2, so the values of `l` and `r` will be integers where both are greater than 2.
- The values of `l` and `r` are now updated to the integers from the input.
- The other variables (`_`, `eli`, `s`, `e`) and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
