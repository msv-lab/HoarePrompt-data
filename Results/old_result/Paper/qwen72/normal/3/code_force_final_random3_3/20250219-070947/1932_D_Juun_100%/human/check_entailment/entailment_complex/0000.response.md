### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. However, it does not explicitly take any parameters, which is a deviation from the expected behavior as described in the comments. The function should take `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` as parameters. Instead, it reads these values from the input inside the function.

3. **Trump Cards and Suits**: The function correctly identifies trump cards and non-trump cards. It stores the ranks of trump cards in the `trumps` list and uses a dictionary `suits` to track non-trump cards by their suits.

4. **Pairing Non-Trump Cards**: The function attempts to pair non-trump cards of the same suit. If a pair is found, it is added to the `answers` list and the corresponding suit is marked as `None` in the `suits` dictionary.

5. **Handling Remaining Cards**: If there are any non-trump cards left in the `suits` dictionary, the function attempts to pair them with trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.

6. **Printing Trump Pairs**: The function prints the remaining trump pairs in descending order of rank. This is correct because trump cards can beat any non-trump card, and the order of printing does not affect the validity of the pairs.

7. **Printing Non-Trump Pairs**: Finally, the function prints the non-trump pairs that were stored in the `answers` list.

### Issues:
- **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1()` should take `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` as parameters, but it reads them from the input inside the function. This is a deviation from the expected behavior and could lead to issues if the function is called in a different context.

- **Input Consumption**: The function consumes the input for `n` and `trump_suit` inside the loop, which means it will read the next test case's `n` and `trump_suit` as part of the current test case. This is incorrect and will lead to wrong results for subsequent test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program has issues with input handling and function parameters, which can lead to incorrect results for multiple test cases. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:
**False**
