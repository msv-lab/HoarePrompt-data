Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and is now `t - 2` (which must still be greater than 0), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of strings.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reassigns `arr` to a new list of strings obtained by splitting the input string. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The previous state of `arr` being a list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the first `x` strings in the original `arr` to integers, is no longer valid. Now, `arr` is a list of strings.
