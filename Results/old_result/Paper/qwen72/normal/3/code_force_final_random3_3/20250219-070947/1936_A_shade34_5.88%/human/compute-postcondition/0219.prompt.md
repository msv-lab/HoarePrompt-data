Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a sequence of queries and responses. The sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} for each test case, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and the response to each query is one of "<", ">", or "=". The function must output a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `pans` must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed, `n` is an input integer greater than 0. If the user's input was `>` at any iteration, `mak` is set to the index of the last iteration where `>` was input. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is the final index of the loop (which is `len(pans) - 1`), `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution and must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer has been flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
