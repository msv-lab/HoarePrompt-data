Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least three elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 3 and all other elements are 0, `j` and `c` are not affected, `i` is the third element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1.
- Initially, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0.
- After the code execution, the element at index `i` in `cntl` becomes 3.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `j`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- `i` is still the third element in the list `a`.
