Output State: **`p1` contains the elements of `vx` and all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` at the time of the tuple's processing. `p2` contains all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the time of the tuple's processing. `ops` is an empty list, and `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing, `p1` will have the original elements of `vx` and any `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` that were appended to `p1` because the last element of `p1` was not equal to `v2` at the time of processing. `p2` will contain the `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` that were appended to `p2` because the last element of `p1` was equal to `v2` at the time of processing. The `ops` list will be empty, and `vx` will still be a set with at most 2 elements left.
