Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `res` is 0, and `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than 1, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

Explanation:
- `mdx` is assigned the value `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- If `n` is 1, `mdx` remains unchanged, and `i` and `res` are not affected.
- If `n` is greater than 1, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is calculated based on the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
