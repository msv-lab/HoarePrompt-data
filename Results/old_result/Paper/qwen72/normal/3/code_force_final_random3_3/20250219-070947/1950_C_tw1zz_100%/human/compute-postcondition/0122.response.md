Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`, `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `_` is a placeholder. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `h1` is the corresponding 12-hour format hour and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is not one of the specified values, `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.**
