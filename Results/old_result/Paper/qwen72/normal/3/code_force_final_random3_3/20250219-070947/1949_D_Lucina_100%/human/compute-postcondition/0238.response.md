To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop:
     - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is the corresponding character from `xx[i][j - 1]`.
     - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', the character is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first \(n // 4 - 1\) elements of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise.

2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates from `i` to `n` and from `j` to 1.
   - For each character in `nx`, the value is determined by the conditions described above.

3. **Determining `nx`:**
   - Since `i` is 1 and `j` is `n`, the loop will start with `i = 1` and `j = n`.
   - The string `nx` will be constructed character by character based on the conditions.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is taken directly from `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', the character is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first \(n // 4 - 1\) elements of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Let's assume `n = 8` for simplicity.
   - `sb` might be a list like `[1, 3, 5, 7]` (assuming these indices have elements in `a` and `b` both 0).
   - The first \(n // 4 - 1\) elements of `sb` would be `[1]` (since \(8 // 4 - 1 = 1\)).
   - `xx` is a 2D list, and we need to know its values to determine the exact characters in `nx`.

5. **Constructing `nx`:**
   - If `xx[1][7]` is not '?', the first character of `nx` is `xx[1][7]`.
   - If `xx[1][7]` is '?', the first character of `nx` is 'S' because `i = 1` is in the first \(n // 4 - 1\) elements of `sb`.
   - This process continues for each character in `nx`.

6. **General Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `xx` are not provided, we can't determine the exact characters in `nx`.
   - However, we can describe the structure of `nx` based on the conditions.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n, and each character is determined by the conditions: if xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', the character is from xx[i][j - 1]; if xx[i][j - 1] is '?', the character is 'S' if either i or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, or 'F' otherwise)**
