To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `power < log2(n)`. The variables involved in this condition are `power` and `n`.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `power` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `power < log2(n)`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - `power` is 1.
   - `log2(n)` is the base-2 logarithm of `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `1 < log2(n)` must be true.
   - This means `n` must be greater than 2, because `log2(2) = 1` and `log2(n)` for any `n > 2` will be greater than 1.

4. **Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
