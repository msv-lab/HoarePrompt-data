Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is the input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=' and must have at least 4 elements.
   - `item` is the fourth element in the list `arr`.
   - `mini` remains the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the third element in the list `arr`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mini` is either the first element of `arr` (if `res` is not '>') or the third element of `arr` (if `res` is '>').
   - `item` is the fourth element in the list `arr`.

4. **Output Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the value of `mini` twice, then the value of `item` twice.
   - Since `arr` must have at least 4 elements, `mini` and `item` are well-defined.
   - The exact values of `mini` and `item` depend on the content of `arr`, which is determined by the input `res` during the loop's execution.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise the third element of `arr`, and [item] is the fourth element of `arr`)**
