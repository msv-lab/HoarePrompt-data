Postcondition: ***`l` is 1 less than `h` or `l` is `mid + 1` (if the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true), `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2` (before any updates), `h` is `l + 1` (if the condition is true) or `h` is now `mid` (if the condition is false). The condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is not true, and `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.***
