Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop. However, the function `func_1` is called without any parameters, which is inconsistent with the problem description. The function should be defined to handle multiple test cases and the input should be passed to it.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes `mex` as an empty list, `minn` as 0, and `maxx` as 0.
   - It then iterates over the array `arr` (which represents `a` in the problem description).
   - For each element `arr[i]`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if the new value is greater than the current `maxx`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the `mex` list, the program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.
   - It then prints a newline to separate the output of different test cases.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation based on the given `a` array.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied.
   - However, the function `func_1` should be defined to handle multiple test cases and the input should be passed to it. The current implementation only processes one test case at a time.

5. **Missing Test Case Handling**:
   - The program should read the number of test cases `t` and then read the input for each test case, passing it to the function `func_1`.

Given these points, the program is **not** fully correct as it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` should be modified to accept the number of test cases and the test cases themselves.

Correctness: **False**
