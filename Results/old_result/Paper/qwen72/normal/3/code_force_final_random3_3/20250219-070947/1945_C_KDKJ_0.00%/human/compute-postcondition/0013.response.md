Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least two characters, `s` is the second character of `a`. If `s` is '0', `x` is 2 and `y` is 0. If `s` is '1', `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. In both cases, `S` is a list containing two sublists: `[0, 0]` and `[x, y]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is incremented by 1.
- If `s` is '0', `x` was initially 1 and becomes 2, while `y` remains 0.
- If `s` is '1', `x` was initially 0 and becomes 1, while `y` remains 1.
- The list `S` is updated to reflect the new values of `x` and `y` in the second sublist.
