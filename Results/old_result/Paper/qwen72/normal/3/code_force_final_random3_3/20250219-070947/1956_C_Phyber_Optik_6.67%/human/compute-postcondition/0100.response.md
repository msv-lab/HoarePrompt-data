Output State: **`j`, `t`, `_` retain their initial values, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `sum` is `sum + i * n`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is updated to `sum + i * n`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
- The value of `n` remains greater than or equal to the new value of `i + 1`.
- The variables `j`, `t`, and `_` are not affected and retain their initial values.
