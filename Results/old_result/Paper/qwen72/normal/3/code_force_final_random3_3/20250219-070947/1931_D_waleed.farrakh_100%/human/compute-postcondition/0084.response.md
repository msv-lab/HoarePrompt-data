The code snippet `freq[current_pair] = 1` updates the dictionary `freq` by adding the key `current_pair` with the value `1`. The value of `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. Since the pair `(rx, ry)` is not in the dictionary `freq`, and `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, the dictionary `freq` now contains the key `(a % x, a % y)` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `(a % x, a % y)` and value `1`, `count` remains unchanged.**
