Output State: **`ops` is empty, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- `ops` remains empty as it is not modified by the code.
- `p1` and `p2` retain their initial conditions as they are not directly modified by the code.
- `vx` is now a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), where the input integer is provided by the user.
