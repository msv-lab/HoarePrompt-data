The code snippet updates the value associated with the key `current_key` in the `residue_map` dictionary. The key `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. The value of `current_key` in `residue_map` is incremented by 1. Since `residue_map` initially has the key `(num % x, num % y)` with the value 2, after the update, the value for this key will be 3. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 3, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` and the value 3, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`**
