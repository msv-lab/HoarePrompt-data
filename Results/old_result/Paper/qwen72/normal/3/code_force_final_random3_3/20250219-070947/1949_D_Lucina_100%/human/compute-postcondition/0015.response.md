Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, and `j` is 1. If the character at position `j - 1` (i.e., the first character) in `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` is increased by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', and both `a[1]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged.***
