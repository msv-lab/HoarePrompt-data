### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the strip, `m`, and the string `s` representing the strip.
   - It initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, which are intended to store the positions of the first and last black cells, respectively.
   - It also initializes `c` and `d` to 0, which are used to count the positions of the first and last black cells.

3. **Finding the First Black Cell:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from the beginning.
   - It increments `c` for each cell and checks if the cell is black (`'B'`).
   - When it finds the first black cell, it sets `mi` to `c` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This part of the code works correctly to find the position of the first black cell.

4. **Finding the Last Black Cell:**
   - The program then iterates through the string `s` from the end.
   - It increments `d` for each cell and checks if the cell is black (`'B'`).
   - When it finds the last black cell, it sets `ma` to `len(s) - d` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This part of the code works correctly to find the position of the last black cell.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length:**
   - The program returns `ma - mi + 2` as the result.
   - The calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` to include both the first and last black cells in the segment.
   - For example, if the first black cell is at position 2 and the last black cell is at position 5, the segment length should be `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`, not `5 - 2 + 2 = 5`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where there is only one black cell correctly. In such a case, the segment length should be 1, but the current implementation might return an incorrect value.
   - For example, if the input string is "B", the program will return `1 - 1 + 2 = 2`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 1.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    mi = len(s) + 1  # Initialize to a value greater than any possible index
    ma = 0  # Initialize to 0
    for j in range(len(s)):
        if s[j] == 'B':
            mi = min(mi, j + 1)  # Find the first black cell
            ma = max(ma, j + 1)  # Find the last black cell
    return ma - mi + 1  # Correct calculation for the segment length
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed calculation of the segment length.
- The corrected program should work correctly for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
