Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- `x` and `y` are both assigned the value `n + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `_`, `inp`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is still described as the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations, but since `x` and `y` are now both `n + 1`, `ans` will be recalculated based on this new value.
