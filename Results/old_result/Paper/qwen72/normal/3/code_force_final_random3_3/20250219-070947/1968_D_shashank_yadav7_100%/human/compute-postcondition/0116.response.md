Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is 0, `s` is 0, `sp` is `a[0]`, `bp` is `a[0]`, `bm` is `a[0] * 1`, `sm` is `a[0] * 1`, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
