Output State: **`i` is 0, `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, if `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `ress` is the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[0] * k`.**

Explanation:
- `ress` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.
- `curr` is calculated as `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, which simplifies to `pres + paths[0] * k`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
