You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters for easier manipulation.

2. **Single Character String**:
   - If the string `s` has only one character, it correctly prints "NO" because a single character is always a palindrome.

3. **First and Last Character Check**:
   - The program checks if the first and last characters of the string `s` are different. If they are, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the non-palindromic partition. This is correct because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.

4. **All Characters the Same**:
   - The program checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same. If they are, it prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same**:
   - The program checks if all but one character in the string `s` are the same. If the length of the string is odd and the middle character is different, it prints "NO" because the middle character would form a palindrome. Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the non-palindromic partition. This is correct because a string with one different character can be partitioned into a non-palindromic substring.

6. **General Case**:
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first and second positions where the characters are different from the first character.
   - It then attempts to partition the string into two substrings such that neither is a palindrome.
   - If it finds a valid partition, it prints "YES" along with the partition details.
   - If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the General Case:
- The program correctly identifies if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- The logic for finding the first and second different characters and partitioning the string is sound.
- However, the program could be simplified and made more efficient. For example, it could directly check if the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings by ensuring that at least one character is different from its corresponding character in the reverse of the string.

### Simplified and Efficient Approach:
- If the string has more than one character and is not a palindrome, it can always be partitioned into one non-palindromic substring.
- If the string has more than two characters and is a palindrome, it can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings by ensuring that the first and second substrings are not palindromes.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and handling of the problem, but it could be more efficient and easier to understand. However, it does correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
