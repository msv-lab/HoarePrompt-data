Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the precondition).
- `i` is 0 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the precondition).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.
- `m` is between `a` and `b` (i.e., `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b`).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2 + m // a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`m // a`**: This is the integer division of `m` by `a`. Since `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b`, the result of `m // a` will be an integer value. The exact value depends on the specific values of `m` and `a`, but it will be at least 1 (since `m > a`).

2. **`2 + m // a`**: This adds 2 to the result of the integer division `m // a`.

### Output:
The code will print the result of the expression `2 + m // a`. Since `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b`, the value of `m // a` will be an integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the output will be an integer greater than or equal to 3.

Output: **2 + m // a (where m is an integer greater than a and less than b, and m // a is the integer division of m by a)**
