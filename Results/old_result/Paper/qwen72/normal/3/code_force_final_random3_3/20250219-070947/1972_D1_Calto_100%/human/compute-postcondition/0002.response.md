Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `x` is `n - 0` (which simplifies to `x` is `n`).**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression `i * i - i` simplifies to `1 * 1 - 1`, which equals 0. Therefore, `x` is assigned the value `n - 0`, which is simply `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
