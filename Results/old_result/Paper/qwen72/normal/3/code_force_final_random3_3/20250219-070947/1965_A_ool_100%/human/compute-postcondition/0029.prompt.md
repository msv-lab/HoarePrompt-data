You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The length of arr is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, the number of piles n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and the number of stones in each pile a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are such that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'.
    #State: `arr` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The length of `arr` is `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, the number of piles `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) and the number of stones in each pile `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) are such that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `A` is False. `set_` is a list of unique lists from `arr`, and it is now sorted in ascending order. The first element of `set_` is 1.
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of lists, `t` is the length of `arr`, `A` is the result of toggling `A` based on the number of iterations, `set_` is a list of unique lists from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is the last index of `set_` that was checked. If any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *`arr` is a list of lists, `t` is the length of `arr`, `A` is the result of toggling `A` based on the number of iterations, `set_` is a list of unique lists from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is the last index of `set_` that was checked. If `not_c` is True, indicating that no difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, `A` is now the opposite of its previous value. Otherwise, `A` remains unchanged.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list represents the number of stones in each pile for a test case. It returns 'Alice' if certain conditions are met, or 'Bob' otherwise.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'.

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
