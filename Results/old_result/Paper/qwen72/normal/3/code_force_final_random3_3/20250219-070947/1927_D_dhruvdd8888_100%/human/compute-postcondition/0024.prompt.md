Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function still takes three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The list `a` should have a length of 2 to 2 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` should be an integer between 1 and 10^6. The number of queries `q` should be a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The `input` function now reads from `sys.stdin`. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is a list of integers read from `sys.stdin` with an additional `-1` appended at the end. `s` is 0. `e` is 0. `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`. `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`, if the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 0, num)`, and `s` is 0. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index 1 of the list `nums`. If `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 1, nums[1])`, and `s` is 1. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged and `s` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to the element at index 2 of the list `nums`. If `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(2, 2, nums[1])`, and `s` is 2. Otherwise, if `nums[1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 2, nums[1])`, and `s` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
