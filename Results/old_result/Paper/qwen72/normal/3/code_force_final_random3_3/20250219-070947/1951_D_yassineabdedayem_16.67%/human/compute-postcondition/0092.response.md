To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(tab))` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop and is currently 0.
   - `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string elements, each representing a value of `number` from each iteration.
   - `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop.

2. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop runs for a total of `rep` iterations, which is up to 60.
   - In each iteration, a value of `number` is appended to the list `tab`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `tab` will contain exactly `rep` elements, where `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60).

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(len(tab))` statement will print the length of the list `tab`.

Given the initial state and the context, the list `tab` will have exactly 60 elements if the loop runs to completion, because `rep` is specified to be up to 60.

Output: **60 (where 60 is the number of elements in the list `tab`)**
