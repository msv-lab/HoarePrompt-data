Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` is greater than 0, so `n` is a positive integer.
2. `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
3. `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is the largest index of a list of length `n`.
4. `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0.
5. `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=' and must have at least 3 elements.
6. `item` is the third element in the list `arr`.
7. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the value of `item`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output a string starting with `?` followed by four values: `mini`, `mini`, `item`, and `item`.
- The value of `mini` depends on the input `res`:
  - If `res` is '>', `mini` is the third element of `arr`.
  - Otherwise, `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
- The value of `item` is the third element of `arr`.

### Output:
- Since `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`.
- If `res` is '>', `mini` is the third element of `arr` (i.e., `item`).
- If `res` is not '>', `mini` is the first element of `arr`.

Thus, the output will be:
- If `res` is '>', the output will be `? [item] [item] [item] [item]`.
- If `res` is not '>', the output will be `? [arr[0]] [arr[0]] [item] [item]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is the first element of arr if res is not '>', or the third element of arr if res is '>', and item is the third element of arr)**
