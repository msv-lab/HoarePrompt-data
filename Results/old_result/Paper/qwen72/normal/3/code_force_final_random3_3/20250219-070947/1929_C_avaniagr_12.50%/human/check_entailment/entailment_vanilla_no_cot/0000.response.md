Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `x < k - 1` Case:**
   - The program checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints 'YES' if true. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that Sasha can place bets in a way that ensures he can always recover from losses and eventually win any number of coins. For example, if `k = 2` and `x = 1`, Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin and recover from a single loss, so he should always be able to win any number of coins if he has at least 1 coin initially.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `x == k - 1` Case:**
   - The program checks if `a >= x + 3` and prints 'YES' if true. This is also incorrect. For example, if `k = 2` and `x = 1`, Sasha can place a bet of 1 coin and recover from a single loss, so he should be able to win any number of coins if he has at least 1 coin initially, not 4 coins.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `x > k - 1` Case:**
   - The program uses a loop to calculate `z` and then checks if `a >= z`. The logic for calculating `z` is flawed and does not correctly simulate the process of placing bets and recovering from losses. The correct approach should be to simulate the process of placing bets and ensuring that Sasha can always recover from up to `x` consecutive losses.

### Correct Approach:

To determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins, we need to check if he can always recover from up to `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to place the next bet. The key insight is that if Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses, he can keep placing bets and eventually win any number of coins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= (k - 1) * x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Condition `a >= (k - 1) * x + 1`:**
  - If Sasha has at least `(k - 1) * x + 1` coins initially, he can always place bets in such a way that he can recover from up to `x` consecutive losses. After `x` losses, he will have at least 1 coin left, and he can place a bet of 1 coin to start the recovery process.
  - If Sasha has fewer than `(k - 1) * x + 1` coins, he cannot guarantee that he will always have enough coins to recover from `x` consecutive losses, and thus he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

This corrected program will correctly determine if Sasha can achieve his goal for each test case.
