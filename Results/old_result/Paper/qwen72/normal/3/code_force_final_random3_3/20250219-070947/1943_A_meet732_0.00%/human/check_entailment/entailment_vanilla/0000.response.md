### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` with zeros. This list is used to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and increments the count of each integer in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is zero. If it is, it immediately prints `0` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX of the array `c` (which will eventually contain all elements of `a`) will be `0`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If `0` is present in the array, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of `2` and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice will try to include as many `0`s as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it by removing `0`s.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from `1` to `n` and checks if the count of each integer in `cntl` is less than `2`. If it is, it decrements `c` by `1`.
   - If `c` becomes zero or if the loop reaches the end of the range, it prints the current integer `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to exclude them.
   - The program correctly simulates this by ensuring that if an integer `j` has fewer than two occurrences, it will be the MEX of the final array `c`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the problem by simulating the optimal play of both Alice and Bob. It ensures that the MEX of the final array `c` is calculated based on the counts of integers in `a` and the optimal moves of the players.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
