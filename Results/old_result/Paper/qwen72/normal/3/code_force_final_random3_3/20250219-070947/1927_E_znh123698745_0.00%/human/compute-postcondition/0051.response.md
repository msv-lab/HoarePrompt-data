Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]`, depending on whether `(-1)`, plus `array[a[0]]`, and `a[0]` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1.
- Initially, `a[0]` is 1.
- After the execution, `a[0]` becomes 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
