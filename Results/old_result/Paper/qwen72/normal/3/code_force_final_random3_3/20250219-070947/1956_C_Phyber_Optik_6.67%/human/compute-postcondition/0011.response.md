To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, which means the variables `i` and `n` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) and `r` is 1.
- Otherwise, if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \), then `sum` is \( i \times n \) and `r` is 0.

Let's analyze the loop head:
- The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will increment `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Since `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 2, the loop will continue to execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

The state of `t`, `_`, `sum`, and `r` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) and `r` is 1. Otherwise, if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \), then `sum` is \( i \times n \) and `r` is 0.**
