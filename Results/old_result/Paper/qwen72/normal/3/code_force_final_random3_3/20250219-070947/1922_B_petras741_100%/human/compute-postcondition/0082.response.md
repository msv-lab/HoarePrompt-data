Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is now the count of how many times the first element of `eta` appears in `w` plus the count of how many times the second element of `eta` appears in `w`, `res` is now `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q1 * (q1 - 1) * (q1 - 2) // 6 + q1 * (q1 - 1) // 2 * rho`, where `q1` is `q[eta[1]]`.**
