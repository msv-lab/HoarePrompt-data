The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a[0]` is now `a[0] + 1`, `i` is 1**
