Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding two different indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` such that `a_i â‰  a_j`. The program processes the input array to identify segments of consecutive identical numbers and then uses these segments to answer the queries efficiently.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` is defined but called with no arguments inside the loop that processes the test cases. This is incorrect because `func_1` is supposed to handle each test case, but it is not being passed any parameters. The correct approach would be to define `func_1` to take the necessary inputs and call it appropriately.

2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` redefines `input` to be `sys.stdin.readline`, which is generally not a good practice. It can lead to confusion and potential bugs if `input` is used elsewhere in the code. Instead, it should use `sys.stdin.readline` directly.

3. **Segment Identification**: The program identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers and stores them in the `arr` list. This part of the logic is correct, but the handling of the segments during the queries is flawed.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that contains the left boundary `l` of the query. However, the logic for determining the output based on the segment boundaries is incorrect.
   - The conditions for printing the indices or `-1, -1` are not correctly implemented. For example, the condition `if s > l` is not the right way to check if the segment contains `l` and `r`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the segment does not contain `l` and `r` or where all elements in the segment are the same.

5. **Debugging Statements**: The program contains some debugging statements (e.g., `if ppp == 23: print(nums)`) that are not necessary for the final solution and can be removed.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the entire range `[l, r]` consists of the same number.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
