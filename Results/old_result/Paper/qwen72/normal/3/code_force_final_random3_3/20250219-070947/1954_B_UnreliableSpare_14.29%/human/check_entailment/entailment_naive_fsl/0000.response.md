Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. The program checks if all elements are the same and sets `ans` to the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove in all cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program will output `2` because it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove based on the first and last elements being the same.

The correct approach should involve checking the array for the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to prevent the array from being beautiful, which is more complex than the current implementation.
