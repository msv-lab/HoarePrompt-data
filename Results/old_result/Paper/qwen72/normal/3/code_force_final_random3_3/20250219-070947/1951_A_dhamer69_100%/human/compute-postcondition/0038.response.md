Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new input integer to the variable `n`.
- The initial state indicates that `start` and `end` are integers within the range 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, and `s` is a new input string.
- The value of `n` is now an input integer, and the value of `s` is still a new input string.
- The conditions for the if and else parts of the initial state are not affected by the assignment of `n` and `s`, so they remain as described in the initial state.
