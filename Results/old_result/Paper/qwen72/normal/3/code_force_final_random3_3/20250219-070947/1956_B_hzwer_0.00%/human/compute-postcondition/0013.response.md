Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` which is now the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n]`. `n` must be at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list, `j` is `n - 1`, and the integer `j + 1` appears at least twice in the `cards` list.**
