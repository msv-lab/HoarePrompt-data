Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime^(factors[prime] + 1)`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, and the loop has yielded values `factor * primes[k]^0`, `factor * primes[k]^1`, ..., `factor * primes[k]^(factors[prime])`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `k` remains a non-negative integer within the bounds of the length of the `primes` list.
- The list `primes` remains unchanged and contains prime numbers.
- The variable `rest` is still the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.
- The variable `prime` is still equal to `primes[k]`.
- The variable `factor` is still the next element of `rest`.
- The variable `prime_to_i` is now equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`.
- The variable `factors[prime]` remains a non-negative integer.
- The loop has yielded all the values from `factor * primes[k]^0` to `factor * primes[k]^(factors[prime])`.
