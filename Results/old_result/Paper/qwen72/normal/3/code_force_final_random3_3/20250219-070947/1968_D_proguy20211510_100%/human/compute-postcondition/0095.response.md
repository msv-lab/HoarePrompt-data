Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`i`**: This variable is equal to the length of the `paths` list minus 1. This means `i` is the index of the last element in the `paths` list.
2. **`pres`**: This variable is the sum of all elements in the `paths` list.
3. **`curr`**: This variable is the final value of the expression `pres + paths[-1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`. Here, `paths[-1]` is the last element of the `paths` list, and `k` is some integer.
4. **`ress`**: This variable is the maximum value encountered in the expression `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `paths` minus 1.
5. **`resb`**: This variable is less than or equal to `ress`, and `ress` is not greater than `resb`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Draw'`.
- The values of `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
- The condition that `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`, and `ress` is not greater than `resb` implies that `resb` and `ress` are equal. This is a key point, but it doesn't affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
