Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `n` is an input integer. `ans` is 0. `cnt` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` must contain at least one integer, `x` is the first integer in `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` must contain at least two integers, `x` is the second integer in `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, and `cnt` now contains the updated count of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` must contain at least three integers, `x` is the third integer in `a`, `cnt` now contains the updated count of the second integer in `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
