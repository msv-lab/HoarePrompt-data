Postcondition: ***The loop has finished executing, and `l` is 1 less than `h` unless the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, in which case `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements). `h` is the index in `D` where `right - f` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`, minus 1, unless the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, in which case `h` is updated to `mid`. `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`; otherwise, `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.***
