You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The list `a` should have a length of 2 to 2 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` should be an integer between 1 and 10^6. The number of queries `q` should be a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is the last element of `nums` (which is `-1`), and `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, each tuple in the form `(1 + s, i, num)` where `s` is the start index of the range and `i` is the end index of the range. `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` (which is `N`).
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

For each iteration, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The conditions for the output remain consistent with the logic of the loop: if `s > l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or `s` is not equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `r`. If `s <= l`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or `e` is less than `r` and if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, the current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of integers and a series of queries from standard input. Each query consists of two integers `(l, r)` where `1 <= l < r <= n`. The function processes these queries to find and print pairs of indices `(x, y)` such that `x < y` and the elements at these indices are different. If no such pair exists within the query range, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, there is an issue with how the program processes the input and queries. The function `func_1` is called inside a loop that iterates `tc` times, but `func_1` itself reads input from `sys.stdin.readline` without considering that it might be called multiple times for different test cases. This can lead to incorrect input handling and thus incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

Additionally, the logic for finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed. The program uses a binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the start of a segment where the elements are different, but it does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when the segment contains only one unique element or when the segment is entirely within a range of identical elements.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
6
30 20 20 10 10 20
5
1 2
2 3
2 4
2 6
3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3

2 1
-1 -1
4 2
4 6
5 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely produce incorrect results for the second test case because it does not reset the state of `arr` and other variables between test cases, leading to incorrect segment identification and query handling.

To correct the program, it should reset the state of `arr` and other variables at the beginning of each test case and handle the input correctly for each test case.
