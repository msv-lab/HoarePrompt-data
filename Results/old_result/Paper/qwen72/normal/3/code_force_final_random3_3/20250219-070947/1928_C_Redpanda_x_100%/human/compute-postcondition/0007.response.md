To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
```

The loop head involves the following objects:
- `_` (a placeholder variable, which we don't need to adjust)
- `factors[prime]` (which depends on `factors` and `prime`)

For the loop to execute, `range(factors[prime] + 1)` must generate at least one value. This means that `factors[prime] + 1` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes)
- `primes` is a list of prime numbers
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable
- `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `factor` is the first element of `rest`
- `prime_to_i` is 1

We need to ensure that `factors[prime]` is at least 0 for the loop to execute. Since `prime` is derived from `primes[k]`, and `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `prime` is a valid prime number. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `factors[prime]` to ensure it is non-negative.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0**
