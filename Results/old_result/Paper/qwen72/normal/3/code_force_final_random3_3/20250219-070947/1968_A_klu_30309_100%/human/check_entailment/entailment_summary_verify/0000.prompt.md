You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`, where each integer `x` in `test_cases` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000. It returns a list `results` where each element is the value of `best_y` for each integer in `test_cases`. The value of `best_y` is the largest integer `y` (where 1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If no such `y` is found, `best_y` is set to 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always find the correct value of `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`. The issue lies in the `break` statement within the loop. This `break` statement causes the loop to exit as soon as it finds a `y` that is greater than the current `max_sum`, which means it may not check all possible values of `y` to ensure that the maximum possible sum is found.

For example, consider the input `x = 10`. The loop starts with `y = 9`:
- `gcd(10, 9) = 1` and `1 + 9 = 10`, which is greater than the initial `max_sum = 0`.
- The loop breaks, and `y = 9` is returned.

However, if the loop were to continue, it would find:
- `y = 8`: `gcd(10, 8) = 2` and `2 + 8 = 10`.
- `y = 7`: `gcd(10, 7) = 1` and `1 + 7 = 8`.
- `y = 6`: `gcd(10, 6) = 2` and `2 + 6 = 8`.
- `y = 5`: `gcd(10, 5) = 5` and `5 + 5 = 10`.

The correct `y` for `x = 10` should be `5` because it maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`. However, the program returns `9`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
