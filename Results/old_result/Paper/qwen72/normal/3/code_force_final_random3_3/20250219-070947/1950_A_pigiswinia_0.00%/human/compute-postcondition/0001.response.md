The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, and it will be set to 0 by the `range(t)` function. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is within the specified range and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0**
