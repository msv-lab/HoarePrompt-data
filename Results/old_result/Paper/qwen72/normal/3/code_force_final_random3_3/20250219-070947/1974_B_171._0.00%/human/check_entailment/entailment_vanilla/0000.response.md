### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string.
   - The function initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the character mappings and an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.
   - It iterates through each character in the encoded string.
   - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
   - If the character is not in the `mapping`, it tries to find a character from 'a' to 'z' that is not already in the values of the `mapping` and maps it to the current character in the encoded string.

3. **Character Mapping:**
   - The program attempts to create a symmetric mapping by iterating through the alphabet and finding the first available character that is not already mapped.
   - However, this approach does not correctly implement the symmetric mapping described in the problem. The problem requires that the first character in the auxiliary string `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on.

4. **Symmetric Mapping:**
   - The correct approach should involve creating the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string in alphabetical order.
   - Then, the program should create a mapping where the first character of `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second from the end, and so on.
   - Finally, the program should use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

5. **Current Implementation:**
   - The current implementation does not create the auxiliary string `r` or the symmetric mapping.
   - Instead, it creates a mapping based on the first available character in the alphabet, which does not follow the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the symmetric mapping required by the problem. It creates a mapping based on the first available character in the alphabet, which is not the same as the symmetric mapping described in the problem.

**Correctness: False**
