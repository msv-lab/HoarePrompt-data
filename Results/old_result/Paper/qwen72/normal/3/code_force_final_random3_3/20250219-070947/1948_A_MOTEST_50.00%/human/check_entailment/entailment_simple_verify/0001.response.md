### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by clearing the screen using `os.system('cls')`. This is not necessary for the problem and can be omitted, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - For each test case, the program reads an integer `n`.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because if a character is special, it must have a neighbor that is the same, and this neighbor will also be special, making it impossible to have exactly one special character.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is not 1, the program constructs a string `ans` to meet the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs the string by repeating each character from the uppercase alphabet twice, `n // 2` times. This ensures that each pair of repeated characters forms two special characters, and the total number of special characters is `n`. This is correct.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with the string 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to repeat each character from the uppercase alphabet twice, `n // 2 - 1` times. This ensures that the total number of special characters is `n` (3 from 'AAA' plus 2 for each additional pair). This is also correct.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans` if a valid string can be constructed.
   - The length of the constructed string is at most 200, which meets the problem's requirement.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Even `n`**:
  - For `n = 6`, the program constructs the string `AAABBB`. This string has exactly 6 special characters (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), which is correct.
  - For `n = 4`, the program constructs the string `AABB`. This string has exactly 4 special characters (positions 1, 2, 3, 4), which is correct.

- **Odd `n`**:
  - For `n = 3`, the program constructs the string `AAA`. This string has exactly 3 special characters (positions 1, 2, 3), which is correct.
  - For `n = 5`, the program constructs the string `AAABBB`. This string has exactly 5 special characters (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints 'NO'.
  - For `n = 2`, the program constructs the string `AA`. This string has exactly 2 special characters (positions 1, 2), which is correct.
  - For `n = 50`, the program constructs a string of length 50, which is within the limit of 200 characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. The string construction logic ensures that the resulting string has exactly `n` special characters, and the output format is correct. The initial assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
