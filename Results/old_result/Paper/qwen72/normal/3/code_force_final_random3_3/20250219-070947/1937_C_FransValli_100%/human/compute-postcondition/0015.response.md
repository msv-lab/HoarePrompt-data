Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0: This means that the user must input a positive integer.
   - `_` is 0: The variable `_` is explicitly set to 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 3: The variable `n` is a positive integer greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 3.
   - `res` is the new input string: The variable `res` is a string input by the user.
   - `maxi` is 2: The variable `maxi` is explicitly set to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement starts with the string `'?'`.
   - The next two values are `maxi`, which is explicitly set to 2.
   - The next two values are `i`, which is explicitly set to 3.
   - The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the console.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The string `'?'` will be printed as is.
   - The value of `maxi` (which is 2) will be printed twice.
   - The value of `i` (which is 3) will be printed twice.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
