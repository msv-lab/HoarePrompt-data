Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` updates the value of `y` to be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. If '1' is not found in the reversed `arr`, `y` will be -1. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `z`) remain unchanged. The value of `z` is still defined as the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`, but `y` has been updated.
