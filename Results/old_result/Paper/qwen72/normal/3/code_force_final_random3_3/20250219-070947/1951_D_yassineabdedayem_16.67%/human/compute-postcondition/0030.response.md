Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, `k` is updated to be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Min`.**

Explanation:
- The code `number = Min` assigns the value of `Min` to `number`.
- The value of `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- The value of `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions that `n` must be non-zero and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` are still valid.
- The list `tab` still contains the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, but `number` is now updated to `Min`.
