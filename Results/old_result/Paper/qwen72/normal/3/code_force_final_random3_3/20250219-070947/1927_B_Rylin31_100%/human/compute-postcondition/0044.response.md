Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 1), `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0 except `s[j]` which is now 2, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` and the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`. `j` is the third element in `array`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
- The initial value of `ans` was a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the same character again.
- After the execution, `ans` now contains the initial string plus one more occurrence of the same character.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `array`, `j`) remain unchanged.
