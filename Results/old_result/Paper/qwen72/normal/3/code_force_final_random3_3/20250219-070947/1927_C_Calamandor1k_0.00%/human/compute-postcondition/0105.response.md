Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from user input, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The function then checks if at least `k // 2` elements in both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k` within the first `max(n, m)` elements. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the lists `a` and `b` and integers `n`, `m`, and `k` being the inputs for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
