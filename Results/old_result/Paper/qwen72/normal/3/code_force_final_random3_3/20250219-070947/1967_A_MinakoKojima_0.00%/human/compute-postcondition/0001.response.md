Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, both greater than 0, and `_` is a placeholder.** 

The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `n` and `k`. Since the precondition states that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, both `n` and `k` will be positive integers. The placeholder `_` remains unchanged.
