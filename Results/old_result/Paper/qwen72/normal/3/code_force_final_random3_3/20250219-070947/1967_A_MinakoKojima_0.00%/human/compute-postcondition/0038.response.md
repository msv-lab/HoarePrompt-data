Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by `min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`. The value of `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
