Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1` if `k` is greater than 0 or `i` is the last value before `k` becomes 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations that were executed, `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[b] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[s] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `sp` and the values at the indices `s` in `a` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `bp` and the values at the indices `b` in `a` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration. If `k` is 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks. Additionally, if `bm` is less than `sm`, the condition `bm < sm` holds. If `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, the condition `bm >= sm` holds.***
