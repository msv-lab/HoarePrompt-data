Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a[0]` is now `a[0] + 1`, `a[1]` is now `a[1] + 2`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`. Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` is incremented by 2.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and the other elements of `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `a[0]` is still `a[0] + 1` as it was in the initial state.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
