Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer greater than 2 and is now `t - 2`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers of length `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x - 2)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet only involves the variable `x`.
- `x` is described as an input integer, and no further modifications are made to `x` in the initial state.
- The `print` statement will output the value of `x - 2`.

### Output:
The code prints the value of `x - 2`, where `x` is the input integer representing the length of the list `arr`.
Output: **x - 2 (where x is the length of the list `arr`)**
