Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains an input integer minus 3.
- `n` remains the length of the sorted list `a`.
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `res` remains 0, as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
- `mdx` is assigned the value of `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This calculation determines the middle index of the list `a` when `n` is odd, and the index just before the middle when `n` is even.
