The only objects in the loop head are the variable `answer` and the list `answers`. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `answers` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` must have at least one element, and `answer` was the last element that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must have at least two elements, and `answer` will be the next (second) element in the list.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `trumps` is an empty list, and `answers` must have at least two elements, `answer` is the second element in `answers`**
