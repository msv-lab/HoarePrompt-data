Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The approach taken by the program is to print the following points for each test case:
1. \((1, 1)\)
2. \((1, 2)\)
3. \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\)

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Base Case (n = 2):**
   - The program prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances: \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\) and \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).

2. **General Case (n > 2):**
   - The program prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) as the first two points.
   - For \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints \((i, i)\).
   - The distances between \((1, 1)\) and \((i, i)\) are \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1)\).
   - The distances between \((1, 2)\) and \((i, i)\) are \(|1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-1) - 1\).
   - The distances between \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) for \(3 \le i < j \le n\) are \(|i-j| + |i-j| = 2(j-i)\).

   The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will include:
   - \(0\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and itself)
   - \(1\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\))
   - \(2(i-1)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\)
   - \(2(i-1) - 1\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\)
   - \(2(j-i)\) for \(3 \le i < j \le n\)

   This approach ensures that the distances \(0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2(n-1)\) are all included in \(\mathcal{H}\), which is the maximum possible range of distinct distances for an \(n \times n\) grid.

However, the program does not consider the possibility of other points that might yield additional distinct distances. For example, for \(n = 3\), the program prints:
- \((1, 1)\)
- \((1, 2)\)
- \((3, 3)\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) in this case is:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)

This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4. However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) can achieve a set size of 5, as shown in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
