Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29. The loop has processed each element in the list `s` from index 0 to 28. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1' and `flag` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the state of `s` and `flag` remains unchanged. The current value of `s[i]` is '0' and the current value of `s[i - 1]` is '-1'.**
