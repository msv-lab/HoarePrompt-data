Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2, `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` is greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1`. If the difference `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` now includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tmp` is a non-empty list containing the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1` and `ans` is increased by `i`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tmp` is a non-empty list containing the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tmp` is a non-empty list containing the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the last processed element. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
