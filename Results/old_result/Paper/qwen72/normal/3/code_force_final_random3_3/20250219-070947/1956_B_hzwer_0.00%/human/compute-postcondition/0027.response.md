Postcondition: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are 0. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` remains 0. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[n - 2][n - 3]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[n - 2][n - 3]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`. The total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
