Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, indicating the number of test cases.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers for each test case, with specific ranges:
  - 2 <= k <= 30
  - 1 <= x <= 100
  - 1 <= a <= 10^9
- The input has at least 2 lines.
- `k` is the first integer from the second line of the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the second line of the input, and it is equal to `k - 1`.
- `a` is the third integer from the second line of the input, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it is a hardcoded string.

Output: **YES**
