Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is [0, 1], `res` is the input string, and `res` is equal to '='.**

The code `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` was [0], so after appending `i`, `arr` becomes [0, 1]. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
