Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29. `s[1]` is now '0'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[1]` was '0', `flag` is now 0. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains unchanged, and `flag` is 0.**
