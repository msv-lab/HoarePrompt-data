The only object in the loop head is the variable `k`, and the loop is set to iterate over the range of 3. This means the loop will execute 3 times regardless of the values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, or the state of `arr`. However, since the task specifies that we should adjust the states of objects in the loop head to ensure the loop executes, and the loop will execute as long as the range is valid (which it is, since `range(3)` will always produce a sequence of 3 numbers: 0, 1, 2), we don't need to adjust `cases`, `i`, `j`, or `arr` to ensure the loop runs.

However, to strictly adhere to the task and adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we can state that `k` should be 0 at the start of the loop, as this is the first value it will take when the loop begins.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `k` is 0**
