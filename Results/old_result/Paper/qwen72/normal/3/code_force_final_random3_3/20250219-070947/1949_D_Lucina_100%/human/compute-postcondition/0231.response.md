The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.

State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 3. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to the previous value of `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise.**
