Output State: **The loop terminates with `l` equal to `h`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is the next element in `F`. `l` and `h` are both set to the index where `D[index] + f` is the closest value to `right - left` without exceeding it. Additionally, `l` is equal to `h`. `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.**
