The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 1, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[0]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 1**
