Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 3, `right` is `n - 3`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the single element `arr[2]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[2]` and `arr[n - 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `left` is incremented by 1, so `left` is now 3.
- The value of `right` remains `n - 3`.
- The conditions for `new_arr` remain the same: if `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the single element `arr[2]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[2]` and `arr[n - 3]`.
- The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged.
