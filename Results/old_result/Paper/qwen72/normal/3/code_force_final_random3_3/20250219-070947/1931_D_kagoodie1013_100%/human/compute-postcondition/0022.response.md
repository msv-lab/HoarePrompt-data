Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is still an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of times the same `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been encountered in `arr`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value is the count of how many times this `(num % x, num % y)` pair has been encountered, `arr` remains unchanged, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The `test_cases` list and the `results` list remain as they were initially.
- The `count` variable holds the total number of times the same `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been encountered in the `arr` list.
- The `residue_map` dictionary contains keys that are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)`, where `num` is each element in `arr`. The value associated with each key is the count of how many times that specific `(num % x, num % y)` pair has been encountered.
- The `arr` list remains unchanged.
- The `num` variable holds the last element of `arr`.
- The `r_x` and `r_y` variables hold the results of `-num % x` and `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, respectively.
- The `current_key` variable holds the tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element of `arr`.
