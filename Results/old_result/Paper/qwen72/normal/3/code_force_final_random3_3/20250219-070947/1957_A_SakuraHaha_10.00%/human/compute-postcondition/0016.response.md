The code snippet `ans += x // 4` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `x` by 4 to it. The value of `x` is the value of the third key in `cnt`. The value of `ans` is increased by the value of the first key in `cnt` divided by 4 (integer division) plus `x` divided by 4 (integer division). The variable `a` remains unchanged, and `cnt` still has at least three key-value pairs.

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `cnt` must have at least three key-value pairs, `x` is the value of the third key in `cnt`, `ans` is increased by the value of the first key in `cnt` // 4 + `x` // 4.**
