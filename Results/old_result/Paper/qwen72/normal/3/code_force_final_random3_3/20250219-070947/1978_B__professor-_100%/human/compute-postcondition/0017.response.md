Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` still holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.**
