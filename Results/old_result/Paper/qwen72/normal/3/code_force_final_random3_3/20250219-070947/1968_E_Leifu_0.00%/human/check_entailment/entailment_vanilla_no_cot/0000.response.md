Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Here's why:

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct and has a size of 2.

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct and has a size of 4.

3. **For \(n = 4\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 7. However, the optimal solution for \(n = 4\) should have a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of size 10, as shown in the problem description.

4. **For \(n = 5\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 9. However, the optimal solution for \(n = 5\) should have a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of size 13, as shown in the problem description.

5. **For \(n = 6\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     6 6
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which has a size of 11. However, the optimal solution for \(n = 6\) should have a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of size 16, as shown in the problem description.

The program fails to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n \geq 4\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
