To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

The loop head is:
```
for item in arr[1:]:
```

The objects in the loop head are:
- `item`
- `arr`

For the loop to execute, `arr[1:]` must be a non-empty list. This means that `arr` must have at least two elements. If `arr` has fewer than two elements, the loop will not execute because `arr[1:]` will be an empty list.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `int(input())` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the input integer greater than 0
- `i` is `n-1`
- `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0
- `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '='
- `mini` is the first element of `arr`

We need to ensure that `arr` has at least two elements for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=' and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is the first element of `arr`**
