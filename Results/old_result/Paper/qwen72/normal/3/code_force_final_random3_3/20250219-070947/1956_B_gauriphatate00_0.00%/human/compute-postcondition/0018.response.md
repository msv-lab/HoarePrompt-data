The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1 from the previous state. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decreased by 1 again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1 from the previous state), `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended twice, `n` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`**
