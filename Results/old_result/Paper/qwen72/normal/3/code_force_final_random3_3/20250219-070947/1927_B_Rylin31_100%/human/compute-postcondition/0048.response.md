Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is \(t-1\), `l` is the last input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0 except for the elements at the indices specified by the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all \( t \) iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
- The loop index `i` is \( t-1 \), indicating that the loop has completed \( t \) iterations.
- For the last test case, `l` is the last input integer provided by the user, which represents the length of the string for that test case.
- The list `s` is of length `l` and contains integers. Each element at an index `j` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`.
- The list `array` is a list of integers provided by the user for the last test case.
- The string `ans` is the final output for the last test case, constructed by converting each element `j` in `array` to a character using the formula `chr(s[j] + 97)`. The characters are appended to `ans` in the order they appear in `array`.

All other variables and states remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
