Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`, `b[2]` is `2 * x`, `b[3]` is `3 * x`, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the value of `b[3]` based on the previous values of `b[2]` and `x`.
- Since `i` is 3, `b[3]` is set to `b[2] + x`.
- From the initial state, `b[2]` is `2 * x`.
- Therefore, `b[3]` becomes `2 * x + x`, which simplifies to `3 * x`.
- The value of `x` remains the same: it is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise it is 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
