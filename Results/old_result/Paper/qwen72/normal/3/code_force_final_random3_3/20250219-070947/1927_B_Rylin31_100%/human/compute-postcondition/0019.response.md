Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 1, `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array` in the order they appear in `array`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `i`, `l`, and `s`.
- The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a space-separated string of integers from the user and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `array`.
- The variable `ans` is still a string containing characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the new `array`. Since `s` is a list of zeros, `s[j]` will always be 0, and `s[j] + 97` will always be 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'. Therefore, `ans` will be a string of 'a' characters, with the length equal to the length of `array`.
