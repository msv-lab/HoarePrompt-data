Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining whether a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and then these two smaller rectangles can be recombined to form a new rectangle that is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle. The new rectangle is considered different if its dimensions are not the same as the original rectangle (considering rotations).

2. **Cutting the Rectangle**: To cut the rectangle, Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides. This means the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions:
   - \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if \(b\) is even.
   - \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) if \(a\) is even.

3. **Forming a New Rectangle**: After cutting, Bob can try to form a new rectangle by combining the two smaller rectangles. The new rectangle will have dimensions:
   - \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\) if \(a\) is even.
   - \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if \(b\) is even.

4. **Condition for New Rectangle**: For the new rectangle to be different from the original, one of the dimensions must be different. This means:
   - If \(a\) is even, the new rectangle will have dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\), which is different from \(a \times b\) if \(\frac{a}{2} \neq a\) and \(2b \neq b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, the new rectangle will have dimensions \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\), which is different from \(a \times b\) if \(2a \neq a\) and \(\frac{b}{2} \neq b\).

5. **Checking the Conditions**: The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes" because a new rectangle can be formed. If neither is even, it prints "No" because no new rectangle can be formed.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), both are odd, so the program correctly prints "No".
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \(a\) is even, so the program correctly prints "Yes" because the resulting rectangles can be combined to form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(2 \times 1\) rectangle.
   - For other cases where either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the program correctly prints "Yes".

7. **Input and Output**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case by reading \(a\) and \(b\). It then prints "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

However, there is a critical mistake in the original assessment:
- The original assessment incorrectly states that for \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), the program prints "No". This is incorrect. The program actually prints "Yes" for this case, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
