The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then calculates the number of complete sets of four sticks of the same length that can be formed from the list `a`. The function prints this count and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input list `a` remains unchanged, and the count of complete sets of four sticks is printed to the console.
