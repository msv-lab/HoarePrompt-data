Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type should appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. The logic in the program for deciding the type of the undecided transition videos (represented by '?') is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to assign 'F' or 'S' based on the number of already decided funny or scary videos for each scenario, but it does not ensure that the resulting sequence of transition videos will meet the requirement for all possible permutations of the scenarios.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
??.?.
```
The program might output:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FSSF.
FFFS.
```
However, for the permutation of scenarios [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the sequence of transition videos would be:
```
F, F, S, S
```
This sequence has 2 consecutive 'F' videos and 2 consecutive 'S' videos, which is acceptable. However, for the permutation [1, 2, 3, 5, 4], the sequence of transition videos would be:
```
F, F, S, F
```
This sequence has 3 consecutive 'F' videos, which exceeds the allowed limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) consecutive videos of the same type. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for all potential cases.
