Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`. If `possible` is True, it indicates that at least one character in `c` is not equal to the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`), or there exists at least one character in `a` that is equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is different. If `possible` is False, it indicates that all characters in `c` are equal to the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` (and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`).**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will have been updated based on user input, and the variable `i` will have been incremented to `n-1` during the last iteration of the inner loop. The variable `possible` will be True if, for any test case, there was at least one character in `c` that did not match the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`), or if there was at least one character in `a` that matched the corresponding character in `b` but the corresponding character in `c` was different. If `possible` is False, it means that for all test cases, `c` matched the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` whenever `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]`, and `c[i]` was either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]` whenever `a[i]` was not equal to `b[i]`.
