Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice.
- The list `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
- The value of `idx` remains `2 + n`.
- The list `results` now contains the result of the function `func_1(n, a)`, which has been appended to it. The specific value of the result is not provided, as it depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
