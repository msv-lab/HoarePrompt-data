To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to start and run at least once.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
```
This loop will execute if the range `1` to `n + r` (inclusive) contains at least one element. This means that `n + r` must be greater than or equal to 1.

### Given State
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Range Condition**: The loop will execute if `1 <= n + r`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `n + r` must be at least 1. This is always true because `n` is a positive integer and `r` is non-negative (as it is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`).

2. **Initial Value of `j`**: The loop variable `j` starts at 1. This is already given and does not need adjustment.

3. **State of `n` and `r`**: The loop depends on `n` and `r`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `r` is non-negative, the loop will execute as long as `n + r` is at least 1. This condition is already satisfied by the given state.

### Adjusted State
The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop will execute if `n + r` is at least 1, which is already satisfied by the given state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

### Final State
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`**

Note: The initial value of `j` in the given state is `n + 1`, but for the loop to start, `j` must be 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`**
