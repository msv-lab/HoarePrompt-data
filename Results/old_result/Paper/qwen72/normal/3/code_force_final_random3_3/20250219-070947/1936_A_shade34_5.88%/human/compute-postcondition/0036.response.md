Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer input such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^3, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If `s` is not `<`, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`), `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to `=`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is equal to `=`.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream. This operation does not change the values of any variables, so the initial state remains unchanged. The output buffer is now flushed, which is part of the initial state and is confirmed in the output state.
