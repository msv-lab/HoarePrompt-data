Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least two keys, `key` is the second key in `nodes`, and `leaves` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration if `len(nodes[key])` is not 1. If `len(nodes[key])` is 1, `leaves` is a list that now includes `key` as its new last element.***
