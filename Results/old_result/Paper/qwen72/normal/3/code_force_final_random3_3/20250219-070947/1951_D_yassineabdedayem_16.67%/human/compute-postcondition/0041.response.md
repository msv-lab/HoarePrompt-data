Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`t`**: This is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This value is not directly relevant to the `print` statement, but it might be used in the context of the iterations.

2. **`_`**: This is set to 0. It is not used in the `print` statement.

3. **`n`**: This is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations. The exact value of `n` is not needed for the `print` statement.

4. **`k`**: This is a positive integer that has been reduced by the sum of all `Min` or `Max` values subtracted from it over the iterations. Currently, `k` is 0. This value is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.

5. **`rep`**: This is 60 or less. It is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.

6. **`tab`**: This is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(len(tab))
```

This statement will print the length of the list `tab`.

Given the initial state, `tab` is a list that has been populated with string representations of `number` values during the iterations. The exact number of elements in `tab` is not specified, but it is clear that `tab` contains the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations.

Since the exact number of iterations and the values of `number` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the length of `tab`.

Output: **len(tab) (where len(tab) is the number of elements in the list `tab`, which contains the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations)**
