Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, the values at indices 1 to `n` of the list `a` are incremented by 1 for each 'F' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the list `x`, the values at indices 1 to `n` of the list `b` are incremented by 1 for each 'S' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the list `x`, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is now a string input by the user, and `xx` now contains the list `x` as its last element.**
