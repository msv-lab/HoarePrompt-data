Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 1, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`, `x` is `n + 1` if `a` > `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is 0 if `a` ≤ `n + 1`, `ans` is 1 if `a` > `n + 1` and `a` ≤ `y`, otherwise `ans` is 2.**
