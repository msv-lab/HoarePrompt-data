The objects in the loop head are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `j` is `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `j` must be adjusted to start from 1, and `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already given).

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 1, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`**
