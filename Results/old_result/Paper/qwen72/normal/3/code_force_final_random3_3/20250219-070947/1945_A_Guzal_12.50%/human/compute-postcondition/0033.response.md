Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9`) from the input, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function then calculates and prints a value `k` for each test case. The value of `k` is determined as follows: if `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is set to `-1`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is incremented by 1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated `k` for each test case. After the function concludes, `n` is unchanged, and `i` is `n - 1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are reset for each test case. **
