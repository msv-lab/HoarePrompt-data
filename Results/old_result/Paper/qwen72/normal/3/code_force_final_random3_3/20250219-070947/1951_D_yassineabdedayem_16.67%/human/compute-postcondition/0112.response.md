Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than zero, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and the current value of `Max` is `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`. `k` is now `k - k` which is 0.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from it. Given that `Max` is equal to `k`, `k` becomes `k - k`, which is 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
