Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a'. The mapping of characters to letters is maintained such that each unique character in `encoded` is assigned a unique letter from 'a' to 'z'. The final state of the program is that `encoded` remains unchanged, `mapping` contains the character-to-letter mappings, and the returned string is the decoded version based on these mappings. **
