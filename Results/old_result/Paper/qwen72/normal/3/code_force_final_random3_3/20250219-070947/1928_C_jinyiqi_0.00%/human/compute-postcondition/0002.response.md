The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. This means that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9
- `output1` is an empty list
- `output2` is an empty list

We need to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1. Since `x` is at least 1, `int(x ** 0.5)` will be at least 1, and adding 1 to it will ensure that the range starts from 1 and goes up to at least 2, making the loop execute at least once.

For the loop to execute:
- `i` must start at 1
- `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1, which is guaranteed by the condition 1 <= x

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1**
