Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged. If `count` > 1, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count` is 1 or less, `done` remains unchanged, and the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.***
