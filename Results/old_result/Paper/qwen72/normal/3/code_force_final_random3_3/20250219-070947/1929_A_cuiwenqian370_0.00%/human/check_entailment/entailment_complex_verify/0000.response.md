Reasoning: 

The original assessment is incorrect. The function `func_1` does indeed compute the maximum beauty of the array correctly. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The function first sorts the array `arr`. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends of the sorted array, and the elements are in non-decreasing order.

2. **Constructing the New Array**: The function then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array. This approach ensures that the largest differences are maximized. Specifically:
   - If `n` is even, the new array will look like `[arr[n-1], arr[0], arr[n-2], arr[1], ..., arr[2], arr[n-3]]`.
   - If `n` is odd, the new array will look like `[arr[n-1], arr[0], arr[n-2], arr[1], ..., arr[2], arr[n-3], arr[n//2]]`.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The function calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`. This is correct because the absolute differences between the largest and smallest elements will be the largest possible differences, and by alternating in this manner, we maximize these differences.

Let's consider the counterexample provided in the original assessment:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4

Expected Output:
6

Actual Output:
4
```

The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The function constructs the new array as `[4, 1, 3, 2]`. The beauty is calculated as:
- `(4 - 1) = 3`
- `(3 - 1) = 2`
- `(3 - 2) = 1`

Summing these differences gives `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`, which is the expected output. Therefore, the actual output should be `6`, not `4`.

The original assessment incorrectly states that the actual output is `4`. This is a mistake in the assessment, not in the program.

Final: **True**
