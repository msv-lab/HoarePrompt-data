Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 1, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` and the value 2, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The initial state is still valid, with the only change being the updated value of `r_x`.
