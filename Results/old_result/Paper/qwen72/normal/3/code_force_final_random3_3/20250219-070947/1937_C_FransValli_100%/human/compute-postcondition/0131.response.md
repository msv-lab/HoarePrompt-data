Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the last input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. The loop will execute again if the user provides a positive integer input.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a new input and `int` converts it to an integer.
- `i` remains `n-1` based on the new value of `n`.
- `maxi` remains 0.
- `res` remains the last input string.
- `arr` remains `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- `mini` remains the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.
- The loop will execute again if the user provides a positive integer input.
