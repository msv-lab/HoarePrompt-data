Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 2, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, the string representation of the updated `number`, and the string representation of the final `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is updated to `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min`, `number` is updated to `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is updated to `Max`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, and `rep` remain unchanged.
- The list `tab` still contains the string representations of the initial, updated, and final `number`.
- `Min` and `Max` are still updated based on the conditions provided.
- `k` and `number` are updated based on the conditions provided, but the specific values depend on the initial values of `n` and `k`.
- The updated value of `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
