Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 0. If the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `b` (and not equal to the first character of `a`), `possible` remains False. If the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a` or `b`, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 1. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `a` or `b`, `possible` remains unchanged. If the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a` or `b`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, `possible` remains False. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains False, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
