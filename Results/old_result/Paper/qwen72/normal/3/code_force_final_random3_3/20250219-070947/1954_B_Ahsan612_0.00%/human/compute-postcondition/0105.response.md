The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, there are three possible states for `i`:

1. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, then `i` is 3.
2. If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar` and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4.
3. If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar` and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 5.

In all these cases, `len(ar)` must be greater than the value of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than the current value of `i` in each case.

- For `i` being 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.
- For `i` being 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4.
- For `i` being 5, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5.

Since the initial condition states that `len(ar)` must be greater than 2, and the highest value of `i` after the previous iteration is 5, we need to adjust the state to ensure `len(ar)` is greater than 5 to proceed with the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 3, `minn` is `inf`, and `num` is `ar[2]`. If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar` and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `same` is 2, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[2]`. If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar` and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 5, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[4]`.**
