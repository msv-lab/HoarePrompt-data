Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `t` and `i`, and specifies that `a`, `b`, and `m` are now input integers.
