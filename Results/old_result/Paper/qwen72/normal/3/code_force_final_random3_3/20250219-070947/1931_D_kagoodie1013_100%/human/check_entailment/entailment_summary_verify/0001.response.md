### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the array `arr` from the list of strings.
   - This approach is efficient and appropriate for the given input format, especially for large inputs.

2. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by storing them in a list `test_cases` and processing each one in the `func_1` function.
   - This ensures that each test case is processed independently and the results are collected for all test cases.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each element in the array, the program calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
     - `r_x = -num % x` is used to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` is used to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with the residue calculation. The correct way to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` is to use `num % x` for both `a_i` and `a_j`, and similarly for `a_i - a_j` using `num % y`.

4. **Pair Counting**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs with specific residues.
   - For each element `num`, it checks if there is already a pair in the dictionary that satisfies the conditions by looking up the key `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - It then updates the dictionary with the current element's residues.
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct, but the residue calculation is flawed.

5. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them one per line, which matches the required output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `n` is small or large, and when `x` and `y` are large.
   - However, the incorrect residue calculation may lead to incorrect results in edge cases where the conditions are not met due to the flawed residue logic.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to store and look up residues, which provides an efficient way to count pairs in O(n) time complexity for each test case.
   - This is appropriate for the given constraints.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Flaw in Residue Calculation**:
  - The program uses `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` to check the conditions.
  - The correct way to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` is to use `num % x` for both `a_i` and `a_j`.
  - The correct way to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` is to use `num % y` for both `a_i` and `a_j`.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (r_x, r_y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation:

- The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the residue calculation logic was flawed.
- The corrected code uses the correct residue calculation, ensuring that the conditions for a beautiful pair are correctly checked.

Final: **False**
