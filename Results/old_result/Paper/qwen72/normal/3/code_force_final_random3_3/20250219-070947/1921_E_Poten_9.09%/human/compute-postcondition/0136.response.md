The code `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `t`, `i`, and `clues`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`answers` is a list with an additional element `'Draw'` appended to it, `test_cases` must be greater than 2, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
