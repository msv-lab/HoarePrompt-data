Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` updates the value of `rx`.
- `a` is the second element in `arr`.
- `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which simplifies to `x - (a % x)` if `a % x` is non-zero, or `0` if `a % x` is zero.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `a`, `ry`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `test_cases` must have at least 2 tuples and `arr` must have at least 3 elements is still valid.
