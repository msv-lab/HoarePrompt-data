The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`**
