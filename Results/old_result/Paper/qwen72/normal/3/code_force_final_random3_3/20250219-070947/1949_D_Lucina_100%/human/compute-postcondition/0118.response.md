The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `i` is 3. If `a[1]` and `b[1]` are both 0, `sa` is a list that now includes the values 1 and 2. Otherwise, `sa` is a list that includes the value 1.**
