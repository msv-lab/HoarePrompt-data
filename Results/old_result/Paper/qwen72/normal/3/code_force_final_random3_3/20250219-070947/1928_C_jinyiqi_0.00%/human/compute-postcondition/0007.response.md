The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive), so the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
- `i` is 1.
- If `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), `output1` is a list containing `[1]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x]`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `x` remains the same, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 2, if `x` is divisible by 1, `output1` is a list containing `[1]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x]`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.**
