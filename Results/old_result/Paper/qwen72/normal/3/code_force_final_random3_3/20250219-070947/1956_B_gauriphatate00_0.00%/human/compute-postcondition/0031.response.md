Output State: **`results` must have at least `t` elements, and each `result` in the loop is the corresponding element in `results` from the first to the `t`-th element.**

Natural language description:
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list must have at least `t` elements, where `t` is the number of times the loop has run.
- During each iteration of the loop, the variable `result` takes on the value of the corresponding element in the `results` list, starting from the first element and ending with the `t`-th element.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
