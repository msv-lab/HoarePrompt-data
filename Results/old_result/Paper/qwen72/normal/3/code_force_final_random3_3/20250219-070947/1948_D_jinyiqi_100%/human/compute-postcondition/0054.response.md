Postcondition: ***`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 2, and `n` must be greater than `j + 1`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0. If `count` equals `j`, the program does not return any value.***
