To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers from the input split.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - If `s > l`, the postcondition remains unchanged.
   - If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `arr` is a list of tuples, and each tuple has three elements.
   - `min(eli, LA)` is used to determine the index of the tuple in `arr` from which `s`, `e`, and `_` are extracted.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers derived from the input, but they are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.

3. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the value of `s` and the value of `e + 1`.

4. **Determining the Values:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e + 1` is the second element of the tuple incremented by 1.

Since the exact values of `s` and `e` depend on the specific tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, we can't provide explicit numerical values without knowing the contents of `arr` and the values of `l` and `r`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element and e is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`)**
