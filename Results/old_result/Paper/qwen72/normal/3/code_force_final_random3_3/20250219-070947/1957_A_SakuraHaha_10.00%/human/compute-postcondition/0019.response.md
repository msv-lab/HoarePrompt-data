The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether it is possible to form a square using the sticks provided in that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, each indicating whether the sticks in the corresponding test case can form a square.**
