Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`, and the current value of `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
