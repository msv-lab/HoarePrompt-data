Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1` and `v3` if `v2` ≤ 0. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the new tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)`, `(v1, 0)`, and the new tuple `(v1, v2)`. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. `len(vx)` is now `len(vx) - 1` and must be greater than 2.**
