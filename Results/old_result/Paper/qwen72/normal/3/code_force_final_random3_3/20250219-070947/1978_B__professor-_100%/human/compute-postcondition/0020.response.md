Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` still holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

Code:
```
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input. The condition `b <= a` or `b - a` being greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n` still holds based on the new values of `a` and `b`. The value of `_` is not affected by this code snippet, and `t` remains greater than the value of `_`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` still holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**
