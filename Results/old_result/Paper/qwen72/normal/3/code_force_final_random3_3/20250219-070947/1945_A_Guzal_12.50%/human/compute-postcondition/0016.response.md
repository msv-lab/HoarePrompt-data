The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state of the program, which includes the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k`, does not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **-1**
