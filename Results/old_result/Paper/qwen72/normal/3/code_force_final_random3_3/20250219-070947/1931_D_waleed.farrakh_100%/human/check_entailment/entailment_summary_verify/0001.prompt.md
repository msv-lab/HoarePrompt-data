You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `arr`. It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. After the function concludes, all elements in the `results` iterable have been printed, and the state of the program includes the number of test cases `t` being greater than 0, `test_cases` being a list of `t` tuples, and `results` being an iterable with at least `t` elements.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_2):**
   - The function reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line and the array `arr` from the following line.
   - It appends these values as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

2. **Beautiful Pairs Calculation (func_1):**
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and checks if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which is necessary for the correct calculation of `rx`.
   - The use of `a % y` directly gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`, which is correct for `ry`.
   - The dictionary `freq` is used to efficiently count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions, which is a valid approach for this problem.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\) correctly.
   - It also handles the constraint that the sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
