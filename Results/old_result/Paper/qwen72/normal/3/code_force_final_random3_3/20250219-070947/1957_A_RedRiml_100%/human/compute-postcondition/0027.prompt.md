Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, and the value of `i` in `d` is 1 if `d.get(i)` was None, otherwise the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged and the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary, and the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was not in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was None, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and the second element `i`. Otherwise, `pl` remains unchanged and the second element `i` is appended to `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary, and the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was not in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was None, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, the second element `i`, the third element `i`, and the third element `i` appended again. Otherwise, `pl` remains unchanged and the third element `i` is appended to `pl`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
