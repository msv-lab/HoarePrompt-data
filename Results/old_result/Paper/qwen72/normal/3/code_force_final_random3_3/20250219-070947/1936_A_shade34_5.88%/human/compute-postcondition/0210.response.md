Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the user input is not `>`, otherwise `mak` is 2. `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution and must have at least 3 elements, the output buffer has been flushed.***
