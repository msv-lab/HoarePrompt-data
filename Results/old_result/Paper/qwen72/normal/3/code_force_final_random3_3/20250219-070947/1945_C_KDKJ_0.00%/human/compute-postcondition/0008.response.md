Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the user input, which must be a positive integer, and calls the function `func_1` that many times. After the function concludes, `func_1` has been called the number of times specified by the user input, and the program state is such that the input has been consumed and the side effects of `func_1` have been applied the specified number of times. **
