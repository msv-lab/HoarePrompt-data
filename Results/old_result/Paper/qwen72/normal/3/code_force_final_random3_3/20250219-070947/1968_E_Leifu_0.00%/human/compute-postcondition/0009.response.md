For the loop to execute, the only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 4, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is not equal to 3

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 3 for the loop to execute. The variable `j` will start at 4, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `j` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
