Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Annotated Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `ans` is increased by the sum of each value in `cnt` divided by 4 (using integer division).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the described operations.
    #   - Based on the example, `ans` will be 1.
    #
    #Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can generalize the output based on the structure of the problem:
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then calculates the number of complete sets of four sticks of the same length that can be formed from the list `a`. The function prints this count and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input list `a` remains unchanged, and the count of complete sets of four sticks is printed to the console.
