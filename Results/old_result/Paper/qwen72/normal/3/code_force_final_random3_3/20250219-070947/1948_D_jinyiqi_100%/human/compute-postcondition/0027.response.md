Postcondition: ***`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2, and `count` is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on whether the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` are met. If `count` equals `j`, the program returns the value of `count`. If `count` does not equal `j`, the program does not return a value and `count` remains as it was determined.***
