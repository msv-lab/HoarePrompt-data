Postcondition: **`answers` is an empty list or contains either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Alice'. `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged. `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, where `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, and either `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd, or `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even. Additionally, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is greater than the current value of `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less. If `clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Alice'.**
