Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` is greater than 0, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `d`, `count_a`) remain unchanged. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_b` remains unchanged. If `len_a > i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged.***
