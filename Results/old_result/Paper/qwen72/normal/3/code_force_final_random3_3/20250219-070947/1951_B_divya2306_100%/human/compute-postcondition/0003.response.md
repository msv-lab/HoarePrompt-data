The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (`k`, `ratings`, `a`, and `wins`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
