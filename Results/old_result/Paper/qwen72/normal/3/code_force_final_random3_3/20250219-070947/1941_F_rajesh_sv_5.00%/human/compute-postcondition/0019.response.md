Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` is None.**

Explanation:
- The variable `next_max_diff` is updated to the value of `diff`, which is `A[2] - A[1]`.
- The values of `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `diff`, `max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, and `max_diff` are still valid.
- The variable `index` remains `None` as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- The variable `next_max_diff` is now equal to `A[2] - A[1]`.
