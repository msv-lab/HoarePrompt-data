Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`).
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `pans` is an empty list.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution. If no user input was `<`, `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is 0.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order.
   - Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the values of `mak` and `mak2` will be the same.
   - The value of `i` is 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2` again.
   - Given the initial state, `mak` and `mak2` are either 0 or some integer value based on user input during the loop execution.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, or 0 if no user input was `<`)**
