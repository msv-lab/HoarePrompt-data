The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers input by the user, and `n`, `i`, and `k` as specific values (`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `k` is 0). However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Output: **-1**
