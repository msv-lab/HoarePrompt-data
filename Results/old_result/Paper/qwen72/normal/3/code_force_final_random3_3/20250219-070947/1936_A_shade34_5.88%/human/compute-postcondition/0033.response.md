Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `i` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If `s` is not `<`, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`), `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to `=`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is equal to `=`.***
