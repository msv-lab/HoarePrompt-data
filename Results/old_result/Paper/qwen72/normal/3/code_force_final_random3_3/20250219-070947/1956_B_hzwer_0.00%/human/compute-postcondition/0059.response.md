The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of two expressions: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `j` is `n - 1`.
- `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
2. `i` is `n - 3`, so `i + 1` is `n - 2` and `i + 2` is `n - 1`.
3. `j` is `n - 1`, so `j - 1` is `n - 2`.
4. The value of `dp[i + 1][j]` is `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`.
5. The value of `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` is `dp[n - 1][n - 2]`.
6. The value of `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` is `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`.

Therefore, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`. `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`.**
