Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers from user input. It then checks if there exists any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such index is found for any test case, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `x`, and `l` as they were last set, and a `flag` variable that is True if the condition was met for any test case, or remains undefined if the condition was never met. **
