Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `trumps` is an empty list, and `answers` has been fully iterated through, meaning all elements in `answers` have been printed.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n`, `trump`, `cards`, `suits`, and `trumps` remain unchanged. The list `answers` has been fully iterated through, and each element in `answers` has been printed to the console.
