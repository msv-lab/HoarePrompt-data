The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `y` being greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 1`, and the loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be `x - 2` and `x` must be at least 2 to ensure that `y` is still positive.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
