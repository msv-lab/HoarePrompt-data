The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (each integer is either 0 or 1) representing the state of each cell. The integer 0 indicates a free cell, and 1 indicates a cell containing a chip. At least one cell in each test case must contain a chip.

Functionality: **The function accepts a test case consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1). It returns the state of the ribbon, which is a list of integers indicating the presence of chips in the cells.**
