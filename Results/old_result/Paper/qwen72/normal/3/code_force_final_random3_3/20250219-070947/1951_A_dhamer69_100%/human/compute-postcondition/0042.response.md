Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string. If `s` == '00', the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.**
