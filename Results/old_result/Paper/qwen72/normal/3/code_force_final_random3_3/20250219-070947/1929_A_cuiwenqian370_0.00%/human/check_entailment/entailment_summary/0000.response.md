Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). To achieve this, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

The provided program sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized because the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other, creating the largest possible absolute differences.

Let's break down the steps of the program:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Constructing the New Array**: The program constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. If the length of the array is odd, the middle element is placed at the end.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

This approach is correct because:
- Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are available for pairing.
- Alternating between the largest and smallest elements maximizes the absolute differences, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted array: `1 2 3`
   - New array: `3 1 2`
   - Beauty: \( (3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
   - However, the expected output is `2`, which suggests a mistake in the reasoning. The correct approach should be to place the smallest and largest elements next to each other to maximize the positive differences. The correct new array should be `[1, 3, 2]` or `[3, 1, 2]`, both yielding a beauty of `2`.

2. **Example 2**: 
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted array: `69 69 69`
   - New array: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: \( (69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 \)
   - This is correct.

3. **Example 3**: 
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted array: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - New array: `100 43 90 54 80`
   - Beauty: \( (100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 54) = 57 + 36 + 26 = 119 \)
   - However, the expected output is `57`, which suggests a mistake in the reasoning. The correct approach should be to place the smallest and largest elements next to each other to maximize the positive differences. The correct new array should be `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` or `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`, both yielding a beauty of `57`.

4. **Example 4**: 
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted array: `3 3 3 4`
   - New array: `4 3 3 3`
   - Beauty: \( (4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 \)
   - This is correct.

5. **Example 5**: 
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted array: `1 2`
   - New array: `2 1`
   - Beauty: \( (2 - 1) = 1 \)
   - This is correct.

The program's approach is generally correct, but the execution summary and the examples suggest that the program might not be correctly handling the construction of the new array to maximize the beauty. Specifically, the new array should be constructed by placing the smallest and largest elements next to each other, not just alternating them.

Therefore, the program is incorrect in its current form.

Correctness: **False**
