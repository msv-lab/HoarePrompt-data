Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `r` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is `j + 1` (which implies `j` is incremented by 1).
- `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` (which implies `j` is within a certain range defined by `n` and `r`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so each integer in the sequence will be printed separated by spaces.

### Output:
- Since `n` is greater than 0, the range will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
- The exact values of `r` and `j` are not relevant to the `print` statement, as they are not used in the range generation.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to n)**
