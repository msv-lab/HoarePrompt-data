Output State: **`i` is 2, `paths` must have at least 3 elements. If `k` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `pres` is `pres + paths[1]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `i`, `paths`, `pres`, `curr`, and `ress` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
