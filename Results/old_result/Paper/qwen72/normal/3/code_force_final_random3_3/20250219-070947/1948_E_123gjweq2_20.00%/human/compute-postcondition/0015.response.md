Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 0), `i` is 0, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - i`, and `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`.
- The code snippet updates `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` to `big_element - i`.
- `big_element` is defined as `right + 1`, so `arr[left + mid + i]` will be set to `right + 1 - i` for each `i` in the specified range.
- The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The values of `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` remain `clique`.
