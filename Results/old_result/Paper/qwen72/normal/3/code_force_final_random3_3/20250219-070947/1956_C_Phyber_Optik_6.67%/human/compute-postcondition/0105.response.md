Output State: **`j`, `t`, `_` retain their initial values, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `sum` is `sum + i * n`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `sum` is updated to `sum + i * n`. The values of `j`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` is still valid.
