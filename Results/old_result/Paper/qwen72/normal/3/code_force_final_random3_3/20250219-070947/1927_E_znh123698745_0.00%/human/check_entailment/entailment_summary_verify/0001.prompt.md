You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` is even). It then generates a list `answer` containing the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating order starting with 1. Finally, it prints the contents of `answer` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation of length \( n \) such that the sums of all continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.
   - \( k \) is guaranteed to be even, and \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \) test cases are given.
   - The constraints ensure that \( 2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It initializes `answer` with the first element of `array` and a list `a` with two elements: 1 and -1.
   - It then iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to construct the permutation:
     - If \( (-1)^i \) is -1 (i.e., \( i \) is odd), it appends the element at index `a[-1]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - If \( (-1)^i \) is 1 (i.e., \( i \) is even), it appends the element at index `a[0]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program starts with the first element of the permutation.
   - For odd indices, it appends the largest remaining element.
   - For even indices, it appends the smallest remaining element.
   - This alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) are balanced, as it alternates between the smallest and largest elements.

4. **Verifying the Output:**
   - The output is a permutation of length \( n \).
   - The sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) should differ by no more than 1.
   - The alternating pattern helps in balancing the sums, ensuring that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any \( k \)-length segment is at most 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the smallest possible \( n \) and \( k \) (e.g., \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)).
   - It also handles larger values of \( n \) and \( k \) within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a \( k \)-level permutation for the given problem. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) are balanced, meeting the requirement that any two sums differ by no more than 1.
