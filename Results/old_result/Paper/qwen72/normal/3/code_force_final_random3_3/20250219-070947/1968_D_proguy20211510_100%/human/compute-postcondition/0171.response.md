The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `paths`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `paths` and the value of `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `paths`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `paths` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `paths` must still have at least 1 element for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, if `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `ress` is the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[0] * k`**
