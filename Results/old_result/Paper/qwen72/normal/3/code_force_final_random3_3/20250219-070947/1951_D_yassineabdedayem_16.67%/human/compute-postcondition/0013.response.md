Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`. `k` is now `k - Min`.**

The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`, where `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. All other initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
