Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is the input integer - 1, `s` is the input integer - 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- `k` is decremented by 1, so its new value is the input integer - 1.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The expressions for `bm` and `sm` are updated to reflect the new value of `k` (i.e., `k + 1`), but the conditions regarding their comparison remain the same.
