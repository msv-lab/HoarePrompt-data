The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`. `n` is an integer with a constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 16. `trump_suit` is a character from the set "CDHS". `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where each string represents a card. The first character of each string is a rank from "23456789", and the second character is a suit from "CDHS". 

The function does not return any value in all cases.
