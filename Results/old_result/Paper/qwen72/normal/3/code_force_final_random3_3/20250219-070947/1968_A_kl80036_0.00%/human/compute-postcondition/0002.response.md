Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is equal to `x // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `y` is assigned the result of `x` divided by 2 using integer division. Since `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` will be a non-negative integer that is half of `x` (or the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2` if `x` is odd). The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
