Since the loop is a `while True:` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the state of objects in the loop head for the first iteration to proceed.

State: **`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1`, which is 1**
