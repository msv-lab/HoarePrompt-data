Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold, and it is also not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.***
