The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `_` will be 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, and `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`, and `x + 1` is greater than `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `a` is less than `z`, `a` is less than `x + 1`.**
