Postcondition: **The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the given problem. It should be defined as `def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y = 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is currently running as the main module.**
