Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`, if the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 0, num)`, and `s` is 0. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `num` is assigned the value of the element at index 0 of the list `nums`.
- If the element at index 0 of `nums` is not equal to `num`, the tuple `(1, 0, num)` is appended to `arr`.
- `s` remains 0 if it was initially 0.
- The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged.
