The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was set by the loop, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, the new state is:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `possible` is unchanged**
