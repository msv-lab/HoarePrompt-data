Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`.
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is a number greater than 2.
   - `power` is defined as the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`. This means `power` is the ceiling of `log2(n)`.
   - According to the initial state, `power` is also equal to `n`.

3. **Conflicting Information:**
   - There is a contradiction in the initial state. `power` cannot be both the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)` and equal to `n` at the same time. For example, if `n` is 5, then `log2(5)` is approximately 2.32, and the smallest integer greater than 2.32 is 3. Therefore, `power` would be 3, not 5.

4. **Resolving the Conflict:**
   - Given the contradiction, we need to assume that the initial state is incorrect or incomplete. However, for the purpose of this task, we will consider the most logical interpretation.
   - Since `power` is defined as the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`, we will use this definition to determine the value of `2 ** power`.

5. **Calculating the Output:**
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`.
   - `2 ** power` will be \(2\) raised to the power of the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`.

6. **Example Calculation:**
   - If `n` is 5, then `log2(5)` is approximately 2.32, and `power` is 3.
   - `2 ** 3` is 8.

Therefore, the output will be the value of \(2\) raised to the power of the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`.

Output: **2 ** (smallest integer greater than log2(n)) (where n is a number greater than 2)**
