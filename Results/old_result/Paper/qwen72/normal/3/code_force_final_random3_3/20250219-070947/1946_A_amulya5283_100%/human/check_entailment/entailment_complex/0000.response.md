### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is necessary to find the median.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula correctly finds the middle index for both odd and even lengths of the array.
   - For an odd-length array, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2`.
   - For an even-length array, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`.

4. **Operation Counting**:
   - The function initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of operations required.
   - It then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array.
   - For each element `a[i]` from `mdx` to `n-1`, if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, it increments `res`.

5. **Output**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function prints 1, which is correct because increasing the single element by 1 will always increase the median.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the function prints `res`, which is the number of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the median value.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Increasing Median**:
  - The current logic counts the number of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the median value. However, this does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
  - To increase the median, we need to find the smallest number greater than the current median and determine how many operations are needed to make the current median equal to this number.

### Correct Approach:
- **For Odd Length**:
  - The median is the middle element. We need to find the smallest element greater than the median and count the number of operations required to make the median equal to this element.
- **For Even Length**:
  - The median is the average of the two middle elements. We need to find the smallest element greater than the second middle element and count the number of operations required to make the second middle element equal to this element.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            median = a[mdx]
            next_greater = mdx + 1
            while next_greater < n and a[next_greater] == median:
                next_greater += 1
            
            if next_greater == n:
                print(1)
            else:
                operations = a[next_greater] - median
                print(operations)
```

### Explanation:
- **Odd Length**:
  - The median is `a[mdx]`.
  - We find the smallest element greater than `a[mdx]` and calculate the number of operations required to make `a[mdx]` equal to this element.
- **Even Length**:
  - The median is `a[mdx]`.
  - We find the smallest element greater than `a[mdx]` and calculate the number of operations required to make `a[mdx]` equal to this element.

### Correctness:
- The original program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
