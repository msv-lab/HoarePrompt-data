The only object in the loop head is the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called twice.

For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must still be greater than 0. However, since `int(input())` is a function call that reads user input, it will be evaluated again at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the state of `int(input())` cannot be directly adjusted, but we can state that it must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called twice**
