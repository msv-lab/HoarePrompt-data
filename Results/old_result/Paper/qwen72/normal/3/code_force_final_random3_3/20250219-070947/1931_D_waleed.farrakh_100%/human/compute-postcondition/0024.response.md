The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` iterable. If `results` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is an iterable with at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element, meaning it must have at least two elements in total.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an iterable with at least two elements**
