Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder and has no specific value needed.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- Both `a` and `b` are odd integers.

The Python code snippet is:
```
print('No')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'No'`. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output of this print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **No**
