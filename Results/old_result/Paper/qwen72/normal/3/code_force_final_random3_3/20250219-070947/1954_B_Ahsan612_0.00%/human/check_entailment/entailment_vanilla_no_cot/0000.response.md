Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Arrays**:
   - The program attempts to count consecutive elements that are the same and then finds the minimum count of such consecutive elements. However, this approach does not correctly identify whether an array is beautiful or not.
   - A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. The program does not check for this condition.

2. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array has only one element correctly. According to the problem, a single-element array is beautiful, and it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, the output should be `-1`.

3. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same, but this is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
   - The correct approach should involve checking if there are any elements that can be removed to break the beautiful condition.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify if the array is already all the same (in which case, it is impossible to make it not beautiful, so output `-1`).
- If the array is not all the same, find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no `a_i` can be replaced by `a_{i-1}` to make all elements the same.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful
        min_remove = inf
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                min_remove = min(min_remove, 1)
        
        if min_remove == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_remove)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Check if all elements are the same**: If all elements are the same, the array is beautiful and it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, so we output `-1`.
- **Find the minimum number of elements to remove**: We iterate through the array and check for the condition `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. If this condition is met, we can remove `a_i` to break the beautiful condition. The minimum number of elements to remove is 1 in this case.
- **Output the result**: If no such element is found, the array is already not beautiful, so we output `-1`.

This corrected program should handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
