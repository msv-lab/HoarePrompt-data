Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 1, the character at the position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', and `b[1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[1]` by 1. Since `j` is 1, `b[1]` is the element at index 1 of the list `b`, and it is increased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
