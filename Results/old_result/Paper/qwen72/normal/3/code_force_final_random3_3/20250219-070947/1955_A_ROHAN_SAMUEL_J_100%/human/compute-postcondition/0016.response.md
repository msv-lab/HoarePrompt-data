The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input. The variable `_` remains unchanged. The conditions related to `n` being odd or even and the comparisons between `2 * a` and `b` are still valid but need to be re-evaluated with the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from input, `a` is the second integer from input, `b` is the third integer from input, `_` is 1. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
