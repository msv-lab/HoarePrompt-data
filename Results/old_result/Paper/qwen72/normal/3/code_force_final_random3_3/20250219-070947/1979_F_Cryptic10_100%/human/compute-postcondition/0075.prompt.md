Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has removed elements from the set `vx` until `len(vx)` is 2 or less. The list `ops` contains tuples of the form `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` depending on the values returned by the function `q`. The variable `p1` is now a list containing the remaining elements of `vx`, and `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the last tuple in `ops`, `p1` or `p2` has `v1` appended to it depending on whether the last value in `p1` is equal to `v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - `ops` still contains at least two tuples.
   - `v1` and `v2` are still set to the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.
   - If `p1[-1] == v2`, `p2` is appended with `v1`.
   - If `p1[-1] != v2`, `p1` is appended with `v1`.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ops` still contains at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are set to the values of the last tuple in `ops`, `p1` or `p2` has been updated by appending `v1` to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
