Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on the array `a` provided, where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program reads the input for each test case, processes it, and prints the constructed permutation. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but it is not defined to take any arguments. According to the problem description, the function should take the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments. However, the function does not use these arguments, and the input is read directly within the function.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to construct the `mex` list by iterating through the input array `arr` and using the values of `arr[i]` to decide whether to add `minn` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is not entirely correct. Specifically, the condition `if minn == maxx:` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach should be to ensure that `minn` is always the smallest non-negative integer not in the `mex` list, and `maxx` should be updated to the maximum value in the `mex` list.

3. **Handling Non-Positive Values**:
   - The program correctly handles positive values by adding the smallest non-negative integer not in `mex` to the list.
   - For non-positive values, the program adds `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list. This is intended to handle the case where `arr[i]` is negative, but the logic might not always produce the correct MEX value.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed `mex` list, which is supposed to be the permutation `p`. However, the `mex` list is not guaranteed to be a valid permutation based on the logic provided.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The MEX calculation and the handling of non-positive values are not implemented correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

To correct the program, we need to ensure that the MEX calculation is done correctly and that the permutation `p` is constructed based on the given array `a`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def construct_permutation(t, test_cases):
    for n, arr in test_cases:
        mex = []
        seen = set()
        minn = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                mex.append(minn)
                seen.add(minn)
                minn = next(j for j in range(n) if j not in seen)
            else:
                p_i = minn - arr[i]
                mex.append(p_i)
                seen.add(p_i)
                minn = next(j for j in range(n) if j not in seen)
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, mex)))

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, arr))

construct_permutation(t, test_cases)
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly and that the permutation `p` is constructed based on the given array `a`. The `seen` set is used to keep track of the integers that have already been added to the `mex` list, and `minn` is updated to the next smallest non-negative integer not in `seen`.
