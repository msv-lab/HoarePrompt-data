Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and ensures it is within the valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` and ensures they are within the valid range (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9).

2. **Conditions and Logic**:
   - **If `b <= a`**:
     - This condition checks if the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`. If true, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage. The profit is `n * a`.
     - This is correct because selling all buns at the usual price maximizes the profit in this scenario.
   
   - **If `b - a >= n`**:
     - This condition checks if the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`. If true, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price to maximize the profit.
     - The profit is calculated using the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - This is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the modified prices for all buns.
   
   - **Otherwise**:
     - This condition handles the case where `b - a < n`. In this scenario, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit is calculated as the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.
     - The formula used is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, which correctly calculates the total profit.
     - This is correct because it correctly handles the mixed pricing scenario.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the conditions and calculates the maximum profit for each test case as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
