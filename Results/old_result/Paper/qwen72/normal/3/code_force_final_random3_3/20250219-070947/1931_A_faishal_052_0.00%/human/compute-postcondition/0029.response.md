The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the end of the list `arr`. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 24, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` is 25, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, and `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52. `lex` is the input integer minus 2 if `lex` is less than or equal to 24, minus 27 if `lex` is 25, minus 27 if `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, and minus 52 if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52.**
