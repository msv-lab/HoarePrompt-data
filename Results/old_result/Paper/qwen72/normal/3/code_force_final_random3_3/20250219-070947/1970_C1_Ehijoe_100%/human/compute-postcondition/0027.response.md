Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least three keys, `key` is the third key in `nodes`, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list containing the third key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.***
