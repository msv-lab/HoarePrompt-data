The function `func_1` does not have any parameters listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing information since the function signature does not include `t`, `x`, or `n`. Assuming these parameters are meant to be part of the function, the function would accept three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.

Since the output is not specified, I cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on the typical behavior of functions with such parameters, the function might perform some operation involving these integers and return a result. Without more specific information, I can only describe the parameters and the general expectation of a return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.**
