Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, and `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial state. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` (where `i` is 2) results in a non-zero value, `s` is a list containing the strings '1', '1', '1', and '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing either `['1', '1', '1', '0']` or `['0', '0', '0', '0']` or `['1', '0', '0', '0']` depending on the initial state.***
