Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`, and `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 0, num)`. `s` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `s = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `s`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` is now 0, and the rest of the initial state is still valid.
