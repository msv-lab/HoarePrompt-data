Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are specific input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

The code snippet `k = abs(n - m)` assigns the absolute difference between `n` and `m` to the variable `k`. The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers within the given range and that `n` and `m` are specific input integers greater than 0 is still valid. The new value of `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
