Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements. `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in `ar` (excluding the last element if it is not part of a sequence), and `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements in `ar`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is now equal to the length of the list `ar`.
- `num` is set to the last element of `ar`.
- `minn` is the smallest number of consecutive identical elements found in the list `ar` (excluding the last element if it is not part of a sequence).
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements in the list `ar`.
