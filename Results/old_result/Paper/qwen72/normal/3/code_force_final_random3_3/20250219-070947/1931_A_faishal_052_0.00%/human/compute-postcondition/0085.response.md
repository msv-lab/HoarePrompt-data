Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `lex` is an input integer.
   - The list `arr` is defined based on the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2].
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52].
     - If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52].

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `arr[k]`:**
   - The value of `k` is 1.
   - Therefore, `arr[k]` refers to the second element of the list `arr`.

4. **Determine the Value of `arr` Based on `lex`:**
   - If `lex` <= 26, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex` - 2]. The second element is 1.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. The second element is 26.
   - If `lex` >= 52, `arr` is [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. The second element is 26.

5. **Calculate the Character to be Printed:**
   - The `print` statement will print `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.
   - Since `arr[k]` is always 1 or 26:
     - If `arr[k]` is 1, `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
     - If `arr[k]` is 26, `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is 'z'.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If `lex` <= 26, the output will be 'a'.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), the output will be 'z'.
   - If `lex` >= 52, the output will be 'z'.

Output: **'a' if `lex` <= 26, otherwise 'z'**
