Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to 1. If `abs(n / 2 - i) >= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, `ans` remains -1 or 0 depending on the initial condition. `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, and `rsum` is `n - 1`.***
