Reasoning:

The provided program aims to convert a given time in 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then for each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It then splits the string into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), and based on the value of `h`, it determines the 12-hour format and the appropriate "AM" or "PM" suffix.

The program handles all the possible hour values from "00" to "23" and correctly converts them to the 12-hour format. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Hour Conversion**:
   - For hours from "01" to "11", the program correctly sets `h1` to the same value as `h` and `time` to "AM".
   - For hour "12", the program correctly sets `h1` to "12" and `time` to "PM".
   - For hours from "13" to "23", the program correctly sets `h1` to the hour minus 12 (with leading zero if necessary) and `time` to "PM".
   - For hour "00", the program correctly sets `h1` to "12" and `time` to "AM".

2. **Minute Handling**:
   - The program correctly retains the minutes (`m`) as they are, without any modification.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the time in the correct format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" using the `print` function with `sep=''` to ensure no extra spaces are added between the components.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as "00:00" and "12:00" correctly, converting "00:00" to "12:00 AM" and "12:00" to "12:00 PM".

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified requirements and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
