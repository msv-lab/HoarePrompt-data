Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the same as the initial `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n).
- `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user.
- `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements.
- `itm` is the third element in `mex`.
- `minn` is the next integer that has not been added to `mex` or is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used.
- `maxx` is the maximum value in the `mex` list.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(itm, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the value of `itm`.
- `itm` is defined as the third element in the `mex` list.
- Since `mex` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `itm` will be the integer at index 2 of the `mex` list.

### Output:
The code will print the third element of the `mex` list, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` statement).

Output: **[mex[2]] (where mex[2] is the third element in the mex list)**
