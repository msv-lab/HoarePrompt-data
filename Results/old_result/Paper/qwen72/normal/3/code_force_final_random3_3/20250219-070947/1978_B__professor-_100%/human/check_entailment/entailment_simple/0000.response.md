### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The constraints for `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are respected, and the program handles them appropriately.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - **Condition 1: `if b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit in this case is `n * a`, which is correct.
   - **Condition 2: `elif b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which can be calculated as `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
     - This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series: `S_n = n/2 * (first_term + last_term)`.
   - **Condition 3: `else`**
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that the optimal strategy is to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining buns is `(n - (b - a)) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and calculates the maximum profit for each test case. The logic and formulas used are appropriate and match the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
