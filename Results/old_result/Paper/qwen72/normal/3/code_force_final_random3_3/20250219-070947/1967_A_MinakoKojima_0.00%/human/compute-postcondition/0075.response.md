Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[1] - a[0])`**. 

The value of `ans` is now the product of its previous value and the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
