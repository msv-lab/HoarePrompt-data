The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`, where 0 <= x, y <= 9. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The function returns the results for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9). It returns the results for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100).**
