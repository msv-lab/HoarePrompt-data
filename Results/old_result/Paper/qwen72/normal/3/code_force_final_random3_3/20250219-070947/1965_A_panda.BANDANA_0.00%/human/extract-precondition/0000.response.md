Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. t should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each n (the length of the inner lists) should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each a_i should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases should not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def game_winner(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each representing the piles of stones for a test case.
