Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string provided by the user, `m` is the minute part of the input string provided by the user, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` is an empty string, `time` is an empty string.** 

The code snippet sets `h1` to an empty string and `m1` to the value of `m`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`) remain unchanged. The conditions for `h1` and `time` based on the value of `h` are no longer valid as `h1` is explicitly set to an empty string.
