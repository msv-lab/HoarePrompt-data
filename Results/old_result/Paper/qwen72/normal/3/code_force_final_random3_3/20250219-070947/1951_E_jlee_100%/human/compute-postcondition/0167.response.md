Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` was found, and `done` is False. If `x` is not equal to the last character in `s`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of a loop. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, all the initial conditions remain the same.
