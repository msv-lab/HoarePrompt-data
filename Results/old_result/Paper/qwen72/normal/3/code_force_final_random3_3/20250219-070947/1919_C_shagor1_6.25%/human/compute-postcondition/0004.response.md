Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0.** 

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
