Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing the strings '1' and '1'.**

Explanation: The code appends the string '1' to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains either the string '1' or '0' based on the bit at position `i` in `x`. After the code executes, `s` will contain the original string followed by another '1'. All other variables remain unchanged.
