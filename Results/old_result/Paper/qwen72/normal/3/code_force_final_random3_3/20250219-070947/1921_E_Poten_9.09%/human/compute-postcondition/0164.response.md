The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answers` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, `answers` must contain at least one result ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice').

State: **`answers` is a list containing at least one result ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the first result in the `answers` list**
