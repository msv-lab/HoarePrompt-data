Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 0, the loop has yielded values `factor * primes[k]^0`, `factor * primes[k]^1`, ..., `factor * primes[k]^(factors[prime])`, and the value `factor` has been yielded.**

Explanation:
- The code `prime_to_i *= prime` multiplies the current value of `prime_to_i` by `prime`.
- Initially, `prime_to_i` is 1, so after this operation, `prime_to_i` becomes `prime`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
