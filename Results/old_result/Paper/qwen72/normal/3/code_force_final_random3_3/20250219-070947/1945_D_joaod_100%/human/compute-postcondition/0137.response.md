Output State: **`na_frente` is at least 1, `v` is 0, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number or is updated to the minimum of its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the previous iteration.**

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, where `v` is 0. Thus, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.
- The values of `na_frente` and `v` remain unchanged.
- The value of `best` remains the same as it was in the initial state, which is either the maximum representable floating-point number or the minimum of its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the previous iteration.
