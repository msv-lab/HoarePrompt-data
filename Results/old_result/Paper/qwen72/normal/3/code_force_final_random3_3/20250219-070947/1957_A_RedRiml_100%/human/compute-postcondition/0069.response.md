The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `pl`. For the loop to execute, `pl` must be a non-empty list. The state of `j` will be the first element of `pl` at the start of the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100
- `w` is greater than 1
- `_` is 1
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers input by the user
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`
- `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared
- `shapes` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, `pl` must have at least one unique integer from `palka`. The variable `j` will be the first element of `pl` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 1 unique integer, `j` is the first unique integer in `pl`, `shapes` is 0**
