Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where the array has more than two distinct elements but can still be made non-beautiful by removing a smaller number of elements.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 3 1

Output:
3
```

The program will output `3`, but the correct output should be `1`. By removing the element at index 3 (value 3), the array becomes `[1, 2, 1, 1]`, which is not beautiful. The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is based on the longest contiguous subarray of the first element, which is not always the case.
