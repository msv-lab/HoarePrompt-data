### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function processes the list `a` to create a new list `a_new` where each element (starting from the second) is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list of unique elements.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It first sorts the list `a` and removes duplicates using `set(a)`.
     - It then computes the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted unique list.
     - The result is a list where the first element is the smallest unique pile size, and subsequent elements represent the incremental differences in pile sizes.
   - **Correctness**:
     - This transformation is crucial for the game logic because it simplifies the problem by reducing the list to unique differences, which helps in determining the optimal moves.
     - The transformation ensures that the game can be analyzed based on the differences between the smallest pile and the next smallest piles, which is a valid approach for this game.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list `a_new` and the number of unique pile sizes `n`.
   - **Behavior**:
     - If `n` is 1, Alice wins because she can remove all stones in the single pile.
     - If `n` is 2, Alice wins if the first element (smallest unique pile size) is even, otherwise Bob wins.
     - For `n` greater than 2, it recursively checks the rest of the list (`a[1:]`) with `n-1` to determine if the next player (Bob) can win. If Bob can win, Alice wins by making a move that forces Bob into a losing position. If Bob cannot win, Alice loses.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The base cases (`n == 1` and `n == 2`) are correctly handled.
     - The recursive case correctly simulates the game by considering the optimal moves for both players. The function ensures that Alice wins if Bob is forced into a losing position, and Bob wins if Alice is forced into a losing position.
     - The logic of checking the first element and the recursive call is consistent with the game rules and optimal play.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - **Purpose**: The main loop reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the winner for each case.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `a`.
     - It applies `func_1` to transform the list `a`.
     - It then applies `func_2` to determine the winner and prints the result.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The main loop correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
     - It correctly applies the functions `func_1` and `func_2` to determine the winner for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game logic and handles all the test cases as described in the problem. Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to work together to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. The main loop correctly processes the input and output.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
