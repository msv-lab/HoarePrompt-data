Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `num` is the last integer in the list `nums` (which is `-1`), `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`, and `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.**

Natural language explanation:
- The loop runs `N + 1` times, where `N` is the length of the list `nums` minus 1 (since `-1` is appended to the end).
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `N`.
- The variable `num` will be the last element in `nums`, which is `-1`.
- The variable `s` will be the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
- The list `arr` will contain tuples representing the start and end indices of each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`, along with the number itself. Each tuple is of the form `(1 + s, i, num)`, where `s` is the start index of the segment, `i` is the end index, and `num` is the number in that segment.
