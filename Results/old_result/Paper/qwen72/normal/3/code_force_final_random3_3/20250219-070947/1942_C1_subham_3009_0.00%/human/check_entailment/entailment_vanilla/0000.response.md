Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - The constraint `y = 0` means we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - In a regular polygon, the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is given by `x - 2`. This is a well-known property of triangulation in polygons.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `x - 2` for each test case, which is the correct number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints: `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, and `y = 0`.
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient as it only performs a few operations per test case, which is suitable for the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem by outputting the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

Correctness: **True**
