### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It iterates through the array to group consecutive elements that are the same into tuples `(start, end, value)` and stores them in `arr`.
   - `arr` will contain tuples representing segments of the array where all elements are the same.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the query boundaries `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It retrieves the segment `(s, e, _)` from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)` where `LA` is the last index of `arr`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists:
     - **Condition 1: `s > l`**
       - This checks if the segment starts after `l`. If so, it further checks:
         - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it means the segment starts at the beginning of the array or after `r`, so no valid pair exists.
         - Otherwise, it prints `s - 1, s` which is a valid pair because `s - 1` is the last element of the previous segment and `s` is the start of the current segment, and they must be different.
     - **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
       - This checks if the segment ends at or after `r`. If so, it means the segment covers the entire query range, and no valid pair exists.
     - **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
       - This checks if the segment ends before the end of the array or before `l`. If so, it prints `s, e + 1` which is a valid pair because `e + 1` is the start of the next segment and `s` is the start of the current segment, and they must be different.
     - **Else:**
       - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `s > l`**
  - This condition is correct. It ensures that if the segment starts after `l`, we check if it starts at the beginning of the array or after `r`. If neither is true, we print a valid pair.
- **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
  - This condition is correct. It ensures that if the segment ends at or after `r`, no valid pair exists within the query range.
- **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
  - This condition is correct. It ensures that if the segment ends before the end of the array or before `l`, we print a valid pair.
- **Else:**
  - This condition is correct. If none of the above conditions are met, it means there is no valid pair within the query range.

### Potential Issues:
- **Sentinel Value:**
  - The sentinel value `-1` is appended to `nums` to handle edge cases. This is a valid approach, but it assumes that `-1` is not a valid element in the input array. Given the problem constraints, this is a safe assumption because the elements are in the range `[1, 10^6]`.
- **Condition Overlap:**
  - The conditions in the `if-elif-else` block are mutually exclusive. Each condition checks a different scenario, and the `else` block handles the remaining case where no valid pair exists.

### Conclusion:
- The program's logic is correct and handles all the given conditions appropriately. The use of a sentinel value and the conditions in the `if-elif-else` block are well-designed to ensure the program works correctly for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs based on the given problem description and function summary.
