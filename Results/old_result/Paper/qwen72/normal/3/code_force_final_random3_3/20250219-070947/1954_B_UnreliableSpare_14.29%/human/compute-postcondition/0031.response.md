The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the same as the input and must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user.
- `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`.
- `val` is the first element of `arr`.
- If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` remains `Decimal('Infinity')`.
- If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')`. The `min` function will return `2` because `2` is less than `Decimal('Infinity')`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to `2`.
2. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is `0`. The `min` function will return `0` because `0` is equal to `0`. Therefore, `ans` will remain `0`.

Output State: **`n` is the same as the input and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is 2, if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
