Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1, and `count` is updated to the previous value of `count` plus `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `freq` is updated to include the key `(a % x, a % y)` with a value of 1, and `count` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rx` is updated to `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `arr`, `a`, `ry`, `current_pair`, `freq`, and `count` remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions are still valid after the code execution.
