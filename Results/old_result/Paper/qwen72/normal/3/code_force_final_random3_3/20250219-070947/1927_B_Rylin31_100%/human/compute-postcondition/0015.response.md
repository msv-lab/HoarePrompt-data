Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
2. `i` is 0.
3. `l` is equal to `t`.
4. `s` is a list of length `t` where each element at index `j` (for each `j` in `array`) is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`.
5. `array` is a list of integers provided by the user.
6. `ans` is a string containing characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array` in the order they appear in `array`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `s` Construction:**
   - `s` is a list of length `t`.
   - Each element at index `j` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`.

2. **String `ans` Construction:**
   - `ans` is constructed by iterating over each element `j` in `array`.
   - For each `j`, the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` is appended to `ans`.

### Example to Illustrate:
Let's assume:
- `t = 5`
- `array = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3]`

1. **List `s` Construction:**
   - `s` is initialized as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `0` appears 1 time in `array`, so `s[0]` becomes `1`.
   - `1` appears 2 times in `array`, so `s[1]` becomes `2`.
   - `2` appears 1 time in `array`, so `s[2]` becomes `1`.
   - `3` appears 1 time in `array`, so `s[3]` becomes `1`.
   - `4` does not appear in `array`, so `s[4]` remains `0`.
   - Therefore, `s` becomes `[1, 2, 1, 1, 0]`.

2. **String `ans` Construction:**
   - For `j = 0` in `array`, `s[0] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98`, which corresponds to the character `'b'`.
   - For `j = 1` in `array`, `s[1] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99`, which corresponds to the character `'c'`.
   - For `j = 2` in `array`, `s[2] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98`, which corresponds to the character `'b'`.
   - For `j = 1` in `array` (second occurrence), `s[1] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99`, which corresponds to the character `'c'`.
   - For `j = 3` in `array`, `s[3] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98`, which corresponds to the character `'b'`.
   - Therefore, `ans` becomes `'bcbcb'`.

### General Case:
- The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values in `array` and the length `t`.
- Each character in `ans` is determined by the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print a string where each character is determined by the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array` in the order they appear in `array`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string constructed from the ASCII values of s[j] + 97 for each j in array in the order they appear in array)**
