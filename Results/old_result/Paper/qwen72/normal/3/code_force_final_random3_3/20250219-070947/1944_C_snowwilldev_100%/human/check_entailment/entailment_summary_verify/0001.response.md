### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to a new array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c` to increase the MEX.
   - Bob should try to prevent Alice from including elements that would increase the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N` to determine the MEX.
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of elements that appear exactly once in `a`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if the current element `i` does not appear in `a`, the function returns `i` as the MEX.

4. **Correctness of the Strategy**:
   - The key insight is that if an element appears exactly once in `a`, Alice can always choose it to include in `c` on her turn.
   - Bob can only remove elements that appear more than once or elements that are not chosen by Alice.
   - The loop in `func_1` correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once and has been chosen by Alice twice (which is not possible since Alice and Bob take turns).

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from the input.
   - It counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`.
   - It iterates through the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and checks the count of each integer.
   - If it finds two or more unique integers that occur exactly once, or if it finds an integer that does not occur in the list, it returns the first such integer.
   - If no such integer is found, the function does not return a value and the state remains unchanged.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - The function correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that is either missing from `a` or appears exactly once.
   - The logic of counting elements that appear exactly once and checking for the MEX is sound.
   - The function correctly handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains all integers from 0 to `N-1` exactly once.
   - The use of `defaultdict` ensures that the count of each element is efficiently managed.

7. **Challenges to the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players.
   - However, the function does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it relies on the count of elements to determine the MEX.
   - This approach is valid because the optimal strategy for Alice is to always choose the smallest unique element, and Bob will try to remove elements that are not unique or not chosen by Alice.
   - The function correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not in `c` or appears exactly once, which aligns with the optimal strategy.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
   - The logic and implementation are sound and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Final:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and implements the optimal strategy for both players, accurately calculating the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game.
