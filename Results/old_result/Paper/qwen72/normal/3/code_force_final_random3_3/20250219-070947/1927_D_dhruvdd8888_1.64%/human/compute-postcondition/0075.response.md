Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value provided by the user input.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(l, r)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `l` and `r` are input integers provided by the user.
   - The `print(l, r)` statement will print the values of `l` and `r` as they are.

Since the values of `l` and `r` are directly provided by the user and not modified in the given code snippet, the output will be exactly the values of `l` and `r` as input by the user.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the input integers provided by the user)**
