Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)], `minn` is either 1 or 0, and `maxx` is either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))` appends the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the list `mex`.
- Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`.
- The value of `minn` is either 1 or 0, depending on the initial conditions.
- Therefore, `mex` will now contain either [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)].
- The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `test_cases`, `arr`, `minn`, and `maxx` remain unchanged.
