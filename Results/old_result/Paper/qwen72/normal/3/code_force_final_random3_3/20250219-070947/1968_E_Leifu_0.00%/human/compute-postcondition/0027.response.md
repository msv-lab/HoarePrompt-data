The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, and `j` is 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 6. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 6.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6**
