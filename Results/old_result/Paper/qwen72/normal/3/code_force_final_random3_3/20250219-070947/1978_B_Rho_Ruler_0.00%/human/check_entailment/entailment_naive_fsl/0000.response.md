Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum profit for selling all buns. The function `func_1` is used to check a condition, but it does not actually calculate the maximum profit. The binary search approach used in the main loop is also incorrect for this problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 4 5
```
According to the problem description, the optimal choice is to set \( k = 1 \), which results in a profit of \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \) coins. However, the program will output `1` instead of `17`.

The issue lies in the binary search logic and the condition used in `func_1`. The binary search is not necessary for this problem, and the condition in `func_1` does not correctly determine the maximum profit. Instead, the program should directly calculate the profit for each possible value of \( k \) and choose the maximum.

A correct approach would be to calculate the profit for each \( k \) from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \) and return the maximum profit. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_profit(n, a, b):
    max_profit = 0
    for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
        profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
    return max_profit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max_profit(n, a, b))
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum profit by considering all possible values of \( k \) and choosing the one that yields the highest profit.
