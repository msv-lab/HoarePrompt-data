Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0. `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` remains greater than 0.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The variable `tmp` remains equal to the first element of `a`.
- The set `aa` remains unchanged and contains the unique elements of `a`.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`. If the last element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0.
- The variable `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0. If no such `cnt` was found, `ans` remains `n`.
