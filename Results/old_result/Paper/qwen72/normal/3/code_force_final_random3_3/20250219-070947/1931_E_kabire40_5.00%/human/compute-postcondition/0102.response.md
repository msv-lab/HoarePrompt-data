Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is -1. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the condition is false and the integer value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`.**
