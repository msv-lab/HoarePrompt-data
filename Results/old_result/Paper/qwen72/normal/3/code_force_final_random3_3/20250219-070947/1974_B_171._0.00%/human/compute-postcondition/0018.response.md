Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary. If `chr(c)` (which is 'c') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated to include the entry `{'c': char}`, resulting in `mapping` being `{'a': char, 'b': char, 'c': char}`. `decoded` remains an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` except for the entries `{'a': char}`, `{'b': char}`, and `{'c': char}` if they were added, and `c` is 99. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.***
