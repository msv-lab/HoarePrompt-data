Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of all elements in `q` at the indices in `eta`, and `res` is the sum of the combinations of 3 elements from each `q[eta[j]]` plus the sum of the combinations of 2 elements from each `q[eta[j]]` multiplied by the sum of all previous `rho` values if `eta_ln` is greater than 1.***
