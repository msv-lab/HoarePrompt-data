Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. `tmp` is a list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`.
- For each iteration, if the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is exactly 2, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If the difference is even but not 2, the value of the difference divided by 2 is appended to `tmp`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `len(a) - 1`, `ans` will reflect the total number of times the difference was exactly 2, and `tmp` will contain the values of all even differences (excluding 2) divided by 2.
