Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\), `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k - q` is not a power of two, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is now `k - 3*q` and is not a power of two, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**
