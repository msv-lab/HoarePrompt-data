Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 3, and `nx` is updated. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` is updated to `nx` + 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to `nx` + 'F'.***
