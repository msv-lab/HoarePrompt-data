Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the requirements and the logic of the given program:

### Problem Requirements:
- Given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a \le n \)
  - \( 1 \le b \le m \)
  - \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Provided Program:
1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \( n \) and \( m \).
   - The logic in this function is flawed. It attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs by iterating over \( b \) from 1 to \( m \) and then performing some arithmetic operations to determine the number of valid \( a \) values for each \( b \).
   - The formula used in the loop is:
     ```python
     x = n - (i * i - i)
     y = i * i
     cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
     ```
   - This formula does not correctly reflect the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). However, this direct approach is inefficient for large \( n \) and \( m \) (up to \( 2 \cdot 10^6 \)).

A more efficient approach involves:
- For each \( b \) from 1 to \( m \), find the number of valid \( a \) values.
- Use the properties of the GCD to simplify the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Reading input
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Printing results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
