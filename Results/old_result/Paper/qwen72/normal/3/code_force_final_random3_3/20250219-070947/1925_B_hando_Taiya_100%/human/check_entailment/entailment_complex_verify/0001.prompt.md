You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, and `i` is the largest integer such that `i` <= `isqrt(x)`. `ans` is the maximum value of all divisors `i` of `x` for which `n` <= `x // i` or `n` <= `i`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that satisfies either \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\) or \(n \leq i\).
    #
    #Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that meets the specified criteria.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers, `x` and `n`, from the user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. The function then calculates and prints the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`. The final state of the program includes the printed value of `ans`, which is the maximum divisor of `x` that meets the specified criteria.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to divide a problem of difficulty \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals \( x \).
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties will be maximized if all sub-problems have the same difficulty.
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( n \), then the optimal solution is to have each sub-problem with difficulty \( \frac{x}{n} \), and the GCD will be \( \frac{x}{n} \).
   - If \( x \) is not divisible by \( n \), we need to find the largest divisor \( d \) of \( x \) such that \( \frac{x}{d} \geq n \). This ensures that we can distribute \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems where each sub-problem has a difficulty that is a multiple of \( d \).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( x \) and \( n \).
   - It initializes \( ans \) to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors \( i \) of \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) (using `isqrt(x)` to optimize the loop).
   - For each divisor \( i \):
     - If \( x \) is divisible by \( i \), it checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{i} \). If so, \( i \) is a valid GCD, and it updates \( ans \) if \( i \) is greater than the current \( ans \).
     - It also checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to \( i \). If so, \( \frac{x}{i} \) is a valid GCD, and it updates \( ans \) if \( \frac{x}{i} \) is greater than the current \( ans \).
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( x \) and checks if they can be used to form \( n \) sub-problems.
   - It ensures that the GCD is maximized by considering both \( i \) and \( \frac{x}{i} \) as potential GCDs.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` optimizes the loop by reducing the number of iterations needed to check divisors.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), the program correctly returns 1.
   - For \( x = 5 \) and \( n = 5 \), the program correctly returns 1, as the only way to divide 5 into 5 sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1.
   - For \( x = 10 \) and \( n = 3 \), the program correctly returns 2, as the optimal division is 4, 2, 4.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently finds the maximum balance (GCD) for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
