Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `a + (b + c) // 3`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the integers input by the user.
- `n` is still greater than 1.
- `i` remains 1.
