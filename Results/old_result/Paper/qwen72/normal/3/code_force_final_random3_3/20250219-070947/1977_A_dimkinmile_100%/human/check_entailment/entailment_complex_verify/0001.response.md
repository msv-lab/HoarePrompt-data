### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Determining the Result**:
   - The program checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
   - If `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add or remove one cube. Therefore, the number of cubes added or removed must be even to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes, which is necessary to build the tower.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than `m` (which would make it impossible to build the tower).
   - It also handles the case where `n` is exactly `m` (which is possible by adding one cube `m` times).

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from the input and checks the conditions `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The annotations also confirm that the function prints "Yes" if both conditions are met and "No" otherwise.
   - The annotations do not indicate any issues with the logic or the handling of inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions used are accurate and cover all necessary cases. The annotated code supports the original assessment and does not reveal any flaws in the logic or input handling.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
