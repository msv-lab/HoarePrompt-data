Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple blocks of chips and the minimum number of operations required to form a single block is not correctly calculated. For example, consider the input:

```
1
9
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
```

The expected output is `4` because you need to move each of the chips in the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th positions to the left to form a single block. However, the program will output `0` because it only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is incorrect.
