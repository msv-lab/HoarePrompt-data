Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, and `arr` is an empty list if `nums[i]` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 0, num)`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of the first integer in the list `nums` to the variable `num`. Since `i` is 0, `num` now holds the value of `nums[0]`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. The condition for `arr` is still valid, so if `nums[0]` is equal to `num`, `arr` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 0, num)`.
