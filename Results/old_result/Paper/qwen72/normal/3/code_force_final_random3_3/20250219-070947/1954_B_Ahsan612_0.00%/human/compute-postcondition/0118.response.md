Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `minn` is the minimum of the original `minn` and 1, and `minn` is not equal to infinity.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(minn)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and 1.
   - Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it must be a finite value.
   - The minimum of any finite value and 1 will always be 1, because 1 is the smallest possible value in this context.

Therefore, the value of `minn` will be 1 when the `print` statement is executed.

Output: **1**
