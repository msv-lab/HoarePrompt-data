Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1, `count2` remains 0, and `done` is False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` equals `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, and `done` is False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
