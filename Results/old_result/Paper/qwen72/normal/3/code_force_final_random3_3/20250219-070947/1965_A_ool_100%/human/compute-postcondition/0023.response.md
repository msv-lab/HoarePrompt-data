Output State: **`arr` is a list of lists, `t` is the length of `arr`, `A` is the result of toggling `A` based on the number of iterations, `set_` is a list of unique lists from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is the last index of `set_` that was checked. If any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.**

### Explanation:
- **`arr`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is the length of `arr` and is not modified within the loop.
- **`A`**: Toggles between True and False with each iteration. If the loop runs an even number of times, `A` will be False. If the loop runs an odd number of times, `A` will be True.
- **`set_`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used for comparison and not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be the last index of `set_` that was checked, which is `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.
- **`not_c`**: If any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` will be set to False and the loop will break. If all differences are 1 or less, `not_c` will remain True.
