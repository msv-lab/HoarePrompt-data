Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, both greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, `i` is set to `n-1`, and `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`. Additionally, each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.***
