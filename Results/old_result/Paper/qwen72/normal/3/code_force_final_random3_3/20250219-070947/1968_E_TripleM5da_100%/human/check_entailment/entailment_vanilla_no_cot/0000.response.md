Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). The program always prints the first two points as \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), and then prints points \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not ensure that the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized.

For example, consider \(n = 4\). The program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
4 4
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |1-4| + |1-4|, |1-3| + |2-3|, |1-4| + |2-4|, |3-3| + |3-3|, |3-4| + |3-4|, |3-4| + |3-4| \}
\]
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ 0, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4, 0, 2, 2 \}
\]
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 \}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5, but it can be shown that the maximum size for \(n = 4\) is 6. A correct solution for \(n = 4\) could be:
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-4| + |1-3|, |1-4| + |1-4|, |1-4| + |3-3|, |1-4| + |3-4|, |4-4| + |3-3|, |4-4| + |3-4|, |4-4| + |4-4| \}
\]
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ 0, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 1, 0 \}
\]
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 7, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 4\).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
