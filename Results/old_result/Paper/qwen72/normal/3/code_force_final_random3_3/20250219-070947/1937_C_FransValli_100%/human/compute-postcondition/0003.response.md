The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop head and can be ignored)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `maxi` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop head and can be ignored)

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 as specified by the `range(1, n)`.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1**
