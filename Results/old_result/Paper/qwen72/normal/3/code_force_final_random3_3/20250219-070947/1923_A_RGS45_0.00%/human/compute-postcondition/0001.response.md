The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of the ribbon and the integer `n` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0 (the loop variable starts from 0).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
