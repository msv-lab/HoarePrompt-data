Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- `Min` is assigned the minimum value between `n // k` (integer division of `n` by `k`) and `k`.
- `Max` is assigned the maximum value between `int(n / k)` (integer division of `n` by `k`, converted to an integer) and `k`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
