Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement starts with the string `'? '`.
   - It then prints the value of `maxi` twice.
   - It prints the value of `i` twice.
   - The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the console without any buffering.

4. **Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. In Python, if a variable is used without being defined, it will raise a `NameError`.

Since `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, the code will raise a `NameError` when it tries to print `maxi`. Therefore, the print statement will not execute successfully, and no output will be produced.

Output: **NameError: name 'maxi' is not defined**
