### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).
   - To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array elements `nums`.
   - It then initializes two variables `x` and `y` to track the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.
   - The program iterates through the array to find the maximum value `x` and the minimum value `y`.
   - Finally, it prints the difference `x - y`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not sort the array, which is necessary to maximize the beauty.
   - The beauty of the array is not calculated correctly. The program only prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array.
   - For example, in the first test case with the array `[2, 1, 3]`, the maximum beauty is obtained by sorting the array to `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\). However, the program would output `2 - 1 = 1`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to sort the array and calculate the beauty correctly.

Correctness: **False**
