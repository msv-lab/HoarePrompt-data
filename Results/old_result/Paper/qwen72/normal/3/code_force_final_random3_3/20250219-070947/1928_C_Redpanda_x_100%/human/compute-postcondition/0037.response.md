The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `factors[prime] + 1`. If `_` is less than `factors[prime] + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, and `factors[prime]` must be at least 0.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `_` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `factors[prime]` must still be a non-negative integer, and the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `factors[prime] + 1`.

Given that `_` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented again, and `factors[prime]` must be at least 1 (since `_` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, and it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration).

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 2, and a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
