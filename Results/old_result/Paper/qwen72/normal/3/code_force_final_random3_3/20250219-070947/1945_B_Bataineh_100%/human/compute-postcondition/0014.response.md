Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers. If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, then `m` remains unchanged. If `m` is between `a` and `b` (i.e., `m` is greater than or equal to `a` and less than or equal to `b`), then `m` also remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `m` is less than or equal to `b` or greater than or equal to `a`, `m` remains unchanged.***
