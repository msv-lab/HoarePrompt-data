Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is `'>`', `mini` is `arr[1]`, `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<`, and `arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the second element in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- `mini` is updated to be the second element in `arr`, which is `arr[1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `res`, `arr`, and `item`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
