Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` is the length of `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the element which, together with the previous element, forms the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The loop has finished executing, and the final values of `l` and `h` are equal. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `f`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. If `l` and `h` are equal, `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and the value of `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The loop has finished executing, and `l` and `h` are equal. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F`. `l` is now the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`. `h` is now the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, or `h` is -1 if no such element exists. If `l` and `h` are equal, `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and the value of `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The loop has finished executing, and `l` and `h` are equal. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F` (if `F` has more elements). `h` is the index in `D` where `right - f` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`, minus 1. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
