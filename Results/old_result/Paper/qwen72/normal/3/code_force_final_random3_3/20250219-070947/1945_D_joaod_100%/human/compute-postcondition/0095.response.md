The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`, and the loop will execute based on the value of `cases`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1, and `cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `cases` must still be greater than 1 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final` + 1, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`; otherwise, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number.**
