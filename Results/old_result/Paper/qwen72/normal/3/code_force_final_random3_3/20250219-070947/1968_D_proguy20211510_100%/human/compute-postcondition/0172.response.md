Output State: **`i` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, if `k` is less than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `ress` is the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[0] * k`**. 

The code snippet `break` causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of `i`, `paths`, `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain unchanged.
