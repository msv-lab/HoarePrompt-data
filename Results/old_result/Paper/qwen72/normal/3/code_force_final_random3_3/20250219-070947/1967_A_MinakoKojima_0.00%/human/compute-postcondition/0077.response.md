Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[2] - a[1])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[2] - a[1])`. Initially, `ans` was `ans * (a[1] - a[0])`, and now it is further multiplied by the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.
