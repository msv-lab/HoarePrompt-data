Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, then `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.***
