Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is 2 if the user input is `<`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 if the user input is not `<`.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change any of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
