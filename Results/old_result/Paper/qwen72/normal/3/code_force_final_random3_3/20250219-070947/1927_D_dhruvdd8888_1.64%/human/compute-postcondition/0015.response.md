Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, num)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a new tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple is `(1 + s, i, num)`, which evaluates to `(1 + 0, 1, num)` or `(1, 1, num)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` now contains the tuple `(1, 1, num)`.
