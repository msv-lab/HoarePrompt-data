Postcondition: ***`answers` is an empty list or a list containing either 'Draw' or ['Bob']. `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged. `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, with `clues[2]` less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` not equal to 1, and both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` being either even or both odd. Additionally, `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. If either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains ['Bob'].***
