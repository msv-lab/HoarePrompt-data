Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` remains the same, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` now includes the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` at the end of the list, `j` is `j + 1`, and `adv` must be greater than `j`.** 

The value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` is appended to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `j` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
