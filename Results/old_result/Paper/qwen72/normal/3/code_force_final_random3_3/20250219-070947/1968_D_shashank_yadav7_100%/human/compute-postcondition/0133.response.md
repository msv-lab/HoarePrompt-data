Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the input integer - 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * (input integer - 2) + 2 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bp` is updated to `3 * a[b]` because `bp` was initially `2 * a[b]` and the code `bp += a[b]` adds `a[b]` to it.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.
