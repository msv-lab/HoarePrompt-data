Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is `j + 1` (this suggests that `j` is being incremented by 1, but it doesn't affect the `print` statement directly).
   - `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` (this condition is given, but it doesn't provide additional information about the values of `j`, `n`, or `r` that are relevant to the `print` statement).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so each integer in the sequence is printed separated by a space.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The `print` statement will print these integers separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to n)**
