You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `nums` is a list of length `n` where all elements are initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` is now `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where all elements except the last one are initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. The value of `k` is now `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. All elements in the list except the last one are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. The function modifies the value of `k` during its execution, but this change is not visible to the user as `k` is not returned.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all the integers in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates through the list and sets each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - This value is subtracted from `k` for each element.
   - Finally, it adds the remaining value of `k` to the last element of the list.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` generates a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit set in `k`. For example, if `k = 5` (binary `101`), then `k.bit_length() - 1 = 2` and `(1 << 2) - 1 = 3` (binary `11`).
   - By setting each element of `nums` to this value, we are ensuring that each element has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - However, this approach may not always be correct because it can lead to a situation where the sum of the elements exceeds `k`.

4. **Correcting the Logic**:
   - The correct approach should be to distribute the bits in such a way that the sum of the elements equals `k` and the bitwise OR of the elements has the maximum number of 1s.
   - One efficient way to do this is to distribute the bits of `k` across the elements in the sequence. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), we can distribute the bits as `1` and `4` (binary `100`), or `3` and `2` (binary `10` and `11`), etc.
   - The provided solution does not correctly handle this distribution and can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 5`, the output should be `5` (which is correct).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output should be `1 2` (which is correct).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the output should be `5 0` (which is correct).
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 51`, the output should be a sequence that sums to 51 and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. The provided solution might not always achieve this.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly handle the distribution of bits to ensure the sum equals `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
