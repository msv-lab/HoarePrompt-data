Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` still holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`. In both cases, `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**
