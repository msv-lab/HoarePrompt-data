The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a list `a` of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and a string `s` of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the inputs. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of `n` characters ('L' or 'R'). It returns a result based on the inputs for each test case.**
