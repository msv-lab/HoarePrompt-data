Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in `cards` that have the same suit as `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `answers` is a list containing strings, each of which represents a pair of cards that were not trumps and had the same suit, sorted by their ranks and joined with a space.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in `cards` that have the same suit as `trump` but with one less element (the last element has been removed), `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value set to a non-`None` value, `answers` is a list containing strings, each of which represents a pair of cards that were not trumps and had the same suit, sorted by their ranks and joined with a space, plus a new string that represents a pair of cards where the first card is `rank` followed by `suit` and the second card is the last element of `trumps` followed by `trump`. If `rank` is `None`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. The list `trumps` is not empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in `cards` that have the same suit as `trump` but with one less element (the last element has been removed), `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value set to a non-`None` value, `answers` is a list containing strings, each of which represents a pair of cards that were not trumps and had the same suit, sorted by their ranks and joined with a space. If `trumps` is not empty, `answers` contains a new string that represents a pair of cards where the first card is `rank` followed by `suit` and the second card is the last element of `trumps` followed by `trump`. The list `trumps` is now one element shorter, and `suit` is the next key in the dictionary `suits`, and `rank` is the value associated with the next key in the dictionary `suits`. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, `trump` is an input string, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value set to a non-`None` value, `suit` is the next key in the dictionary `suits`, and `rank` is the value associated with the next key in the dictionary `suits`. If `trumps` is not an empty list and `rank` is not `None`, the `answers` list has one more element, which is a string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, and the `trumps` list has one less element. If `trumps` is not an empty list but `rank` is `None`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. If `trumps` is an empty list, the program does not return any value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
