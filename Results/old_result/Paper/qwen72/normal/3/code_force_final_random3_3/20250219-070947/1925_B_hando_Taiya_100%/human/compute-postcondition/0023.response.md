Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, and `i` is the largest integer such that `i` <= `isqrt(x)`. `ans` is the maximum value of all divisors `i` of `x` for which `n` <= `x // i` or `n` <= `i`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^3.
- The variable `x` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^8.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to `x`.
- The loop variable `i` will have completed all iterations from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
- The variable `ans` will be the maximum value among all divisors `i` of `x` for which `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such divisors exist, `ans` will remain 0.
