Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5; `cases` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5; `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from input, `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0 that are less than or equal to `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final` + 1, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`; otherwise, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
