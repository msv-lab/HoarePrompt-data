The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `_` is increased by 1, so `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**
