Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `a` is the second integer from input.
- `b` is the third integer from input.
- `_` is 1.
- If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.
- If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is the first integer from input.
   - The value of `n` can be either odd or even.

2. **Variable `b`**:
   - `b` is the third integer from input.
   - The value of `b` is an integer.

3. **Expression `n // 2`**:
   - The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
   - If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be exactly half of `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be \((n - 1) // 2\), which is the largest integer less than half of `n`.

4. **Expression `n // 2 * b`**:
   - This expression multiplies the result of `n // 2` by `b`.
   - If `n` is even, the result is \(\frac{n}{2} * b\).
   - If `n` is odd, the result is \(\left(\frac{n - 1}{2}\right) * b\).

### Output:
The code snippet `print(n // 2 * b)` will print the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`.

- If `n` is even, the output will be \(\frac{n}{2} * b\).
- If `n` is odd, the output will be \(\left(\frac{n - 1}{2}\right) * b\).

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **\(\left(\frac{n}{2} * b\right)\) if `n` is even, or \(\left(\frac{n - 1}{2} * b\right)\) if `n` is odd**.
