Output State: **`z` is updated to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`, `x` is already greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is `x - k + 3`, `x - k + 3` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`z`**: The value of `z` is updated by adding `(z // (k - 1) + 1)` for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `x - k + 3` times, `z` will be updated to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`.
- **`x`**: The value of `x` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be equal to `x - k + 3` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
- **`x - k + 3`**: This expression determines the number of times the loop will execute. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to this value, confirming that the loop has run the expected number of times.
