Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. `t` is now an input integer within the range 1 to 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    possible = False
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if c[i] != a[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
            continue
        else:
            possible = True
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`. If there exists at least one character in `a` that is equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is different, or if there exists at least one character in `a` that is not equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is not equal to either `a` or `b`, then `possible` is set to True. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`. If `possible` is True, it indicates that at least one character in `c` is not equal to the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`). If `possible` is False, it indicates that all characters in `c` are equal to the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` (and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`. If `possible` is True, the conditions that led to `possible` being True are: either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]`. If `possible` is False, none of these conditions were met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
