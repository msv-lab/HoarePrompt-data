Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `q` is defined as a lambda function that prints a query "? d" to the console, where `d` is an integer, and then reads a response from the input, converting it to a map of integers. The initial state remains unchanged, and the function can now be used to make queries to the interactor.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples it originally had, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ops` is empty, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, and `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1` contains the elements of `vx` and all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` at the time of the tuple's processing. `p2` contains all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the time of the tuple's processing. `ops` is an empty list, and `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
