Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists. Each sublist in `S` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point. The final sublist in `S` will contain the total counts of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The input integer `n` remains unchanged.
- The string `a` must have at least as many characters as its original length.
- The list `S` will have a total of `len(a) + 1` sublists, where each sublist `[x, y]` in `S` represents the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `a` up to that point in the loop.
- The last sublist in `S` will contain the total counts of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`. For example, if `a` is "01010", the final sublist in `S` will be `[3, 2]` because there are 3 '0's and 2 '1's in `a`.
