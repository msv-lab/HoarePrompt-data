Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 1), `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`, `j` is the first element in `array`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
- `s[j]` is 0 because `s` is a list of zeros.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `0 + 97`, which is `'a'`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `j` remain unchanged.
