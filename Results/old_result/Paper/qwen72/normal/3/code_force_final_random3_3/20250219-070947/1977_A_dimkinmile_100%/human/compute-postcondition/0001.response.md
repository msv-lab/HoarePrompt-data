Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` and `m` are now assigned the values from the input, where the input is a space-separated string of two integers. The difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, i.e., (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0.**
