The value of `rep` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `number`, `Max`, `Min`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(number)`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `tab` contains `str(Min)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Max`, and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `tab` contains `str(Max)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and `number` is `Max`. `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**
