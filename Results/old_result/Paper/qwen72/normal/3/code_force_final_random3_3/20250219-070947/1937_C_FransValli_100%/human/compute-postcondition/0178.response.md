Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`n` remains the same**: This means `n` is a constant value, but its specific value is not provided.
2. **`i` is `n-1`**: `i` is one less than `n`.
3. **`maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses**: This means `maxi` is the index of the last input that was `<`.
4. **`res` is the last input string**: `res` is the most recent input string.
5. **`mini` is `arr[0]`**: `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`.
6. **`arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<`, and `arr` must have at least two elements**: This means `arr` is a list that includes indices where the input was `=` and the last index where the input was `<`. Since `arr` must have at least two elements, `arr[0]` and `arr[1]` are valid.
7. **`item` is the second element in `arr`**: `item` is the second element of the list `arr`.

Given the print statement:
```
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

- **`mini`** is the first element of `arr`.
- **`item`** is the second element of `arr`.

The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mini` and `item` repeated twice.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of the list `arr` and [item] is the second element of the list `arr`)**
