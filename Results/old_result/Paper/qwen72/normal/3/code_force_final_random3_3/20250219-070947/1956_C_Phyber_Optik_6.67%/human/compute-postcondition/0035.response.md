Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `n + r` must be at least 1.
- `j` is `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n`**:
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0. This means `n` is a positive integer.

2. **Understanding `range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.

3. **Understanding the `print` statement**:
   - The `print` statement with the `*` operator unpacks the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` and prints each element separated by a space.

### Example:
- If `n` is 5, then `range(1, 5 + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The `print` statement will unpack this sequence and print: `1 2 3 4 5`.

### General Case:
- For any positive integer `n`, the `print` statement will output the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer and must be greater than 0)**
