Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Odd and Even Cases**:
   - **Odd Number of Yogurts (n % 2 == 1)**:
     - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is less than the promotion price (b), it's cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price, so it prints `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buys one additional yogurt at the regular price, so it prints `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - **Even Number of Yogurts (n % 2 == 0)**:
     - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is less than the promotion price (b), it's cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price, so it prints `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, so it prints `n // 2 * b`.

The logic correctly handles both odd and even numbers of yogurts and ensures the minimum cost is calculated based on the given conditions. The program also matches the expected output for the provided example test cases.
