Output State: **`q` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y`.**

The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided by the user input. The condition for printing 'NO' or 'YES' remains the same, but it will now be evaluated using the new values of `x` and `y`. The value of `q` remains greater than 1.
