Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell of each path is guaranteed to be empty.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the precondition:

```python
def max_coins(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing the integer `n` and the string representing the path.
