The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `a` must be assigned to `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second integer in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must now be the third integer in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`.**
