### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. It is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.
   - **`func_2(n, m)`**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the implementation of `func_2` does not seem to correctly address the problem.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function initializes `cnt` to -1, which is unusual and suggests a potential off-by-one error.
   - It iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `m`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not directly related to the problem's condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This means \(a + b\) should be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not perform this check. Instead, it uses a different formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The initialization of `cnt` to -1 and the subsequent addition of `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
