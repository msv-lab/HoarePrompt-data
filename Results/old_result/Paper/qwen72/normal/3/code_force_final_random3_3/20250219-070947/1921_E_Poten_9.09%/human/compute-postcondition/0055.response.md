Postcondition: **`answers` is an empty list, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, and either `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd, or `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even. Additionally, `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1. The current state is that either the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2.**
