The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. However, given the constraints, it is likely that the function processes these values in some way and returns a result based on the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes test cases where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The specific output of the function is not provided, but it likely returns a result based on these input values.**
