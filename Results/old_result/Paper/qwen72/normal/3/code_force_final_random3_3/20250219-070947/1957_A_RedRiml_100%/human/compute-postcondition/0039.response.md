Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `palka`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The variable `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- The variable `shapes` is updated to be the sum of the integer division of the counts of each unique integer in `palka` by 3, but only for those integers that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. If an integer appears fewer than 3 times, it does not contribute to the value of `shapes`.
