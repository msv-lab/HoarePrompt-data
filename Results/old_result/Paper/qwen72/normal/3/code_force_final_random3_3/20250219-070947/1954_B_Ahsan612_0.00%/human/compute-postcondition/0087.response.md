The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given that `ar` has at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` is at least 2. Since `i` is 1, the condition `i < len(ar)` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, `same` is 1**
