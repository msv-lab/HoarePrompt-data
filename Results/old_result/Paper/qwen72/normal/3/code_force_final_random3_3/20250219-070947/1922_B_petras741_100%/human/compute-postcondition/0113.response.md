The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `n`, and the list `w`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1, and `eta` is either a list containing `[0]` if `q[j]` is greater than 0, or an empty list if `q[j]` is 0.**
