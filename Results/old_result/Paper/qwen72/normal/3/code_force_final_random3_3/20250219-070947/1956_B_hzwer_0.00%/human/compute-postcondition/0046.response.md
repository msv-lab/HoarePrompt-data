The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `dp`, but since `dp` is not directly modified in the loop head, we only need to adjust `j`. According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 to `n - 3`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `j` is `n - 3`.**
