The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `left <= right`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is 1 and `right` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

Given that `left` is 1 and `right` is `n - 2`, the loop can execute one more time if `1 <= n - 2`, which simplifies to `n >= 3`. Since the initial state specifies that `2 <= n <= 100`, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue, no adjustment is needed to `n`.

However, the state of `left` and `right` must be such that `left` is less than or equal to `right` after the next iteration. Since the current state of `left` and `right` is not provided in terms of how they change within the loop, we assume they are modified in a way that maintains the loop condition. Therefore, the state can remain the same, as the loop condition is still satisfied.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.**
