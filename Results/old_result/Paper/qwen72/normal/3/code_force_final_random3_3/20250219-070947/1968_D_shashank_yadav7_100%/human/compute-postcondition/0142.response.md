Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + 3 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sp` is updated by adding `a[s]` to its current value.
- The previous value of `sp` was `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, so after adding `a[s]` again, `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, and `bp` remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement (`k` is 0) is still valid and unchanged.
