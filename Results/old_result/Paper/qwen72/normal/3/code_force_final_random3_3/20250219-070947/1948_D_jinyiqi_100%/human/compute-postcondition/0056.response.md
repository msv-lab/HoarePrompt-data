The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` starting from `n // 2` down to `1` (exclusive), decrementing by `1` each time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n // 2 - 1` and `k` is `n - j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by `1` to `n // 2 - 2`.

Given that `j` is `n // 2 - 1` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `j` will be `n // 2 - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than `0`.

State: **`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`**
