You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two integers a and b as input, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, and for each iteration, `a` and `b` were integers provided by the user input. If either `a` or `b` was even, the program printed 'Yes'. If both `a` and `b` were odd, the program printed 'No'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining whether a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and then these two smaller rectangles can be recombined to form a new rectangle that is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle. The new rectangle is considered different if its dimensions are not the same as the original rectangle (considering rotations).

2. **Cutting the Rectangle**: To cut the rectangle, Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides. This means the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions:
   - \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if \(b\) is even.
   - \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) if \(a\) is even.

3. **Forming a New Rectangle**: After cutting, Bob can try to form a new rectangle by combining the two smaller rectangles. The new rectangle will have dimensions:
   - \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\) if \(a\) is even.
   - \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if \(b\) is even.

4. **Condition for New Rectangle**: For the new rectangle to be different from the original, one of the dimensions must be different. This means:
   - If \(a\) is even, the new rectangle will have dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\), which is different from \(a \times b\) if \(\frac{a}{2} \neq a\) and \(2b \neq b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, the new rectangle will have dimensions \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\), which is different from \(a \times b\) if \(2a \neq a\) and \(\frac{b}{2} \neq b\).

5. **Checking the Conditions**: The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes" because a new rectangle can be formed. If neither is even, it prints "No" because no new rectangle can be formed.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), both are odd, so the program correctly prints "No".
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \(a\) is even, so the program correctly prints "No" because the only possible new rectangle is \(1 \times 2\), which is the same as the original.
   - For other cases where either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the program correctly prints "Yes".

7. **Input and Output**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case by reading \(a\) and \(b\). It then prints "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem.
