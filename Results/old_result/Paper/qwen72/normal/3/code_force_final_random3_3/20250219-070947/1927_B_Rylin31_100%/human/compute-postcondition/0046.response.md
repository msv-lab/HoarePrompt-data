Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 1), `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0 except for the elements at the indices specified by the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
- The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still 2.
- The value of `l` remains unchanged and is still the input integer greater than 1.
- The list `s` is now modified such that each element at the index specified by an element in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`.
- The list `array` remains unchanged.
- The string `ans` is constructed by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`. Each time an element `j` is processed, `s[j]` is incremented, so the characters in `ans` will reflect the cumulative count of each index in `array`.
