Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `ps` is the fourth input value converted to an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing one element which is `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing one element which is `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the elements `a[ps - 1]` and the new element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
