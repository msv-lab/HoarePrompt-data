Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`**.

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the factorial of `n`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `_`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The factorial of `n` is a specific value, which is the product of all positive integers up to `n`.
