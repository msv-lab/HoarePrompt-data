Output State: **`y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`, `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `val_in = rev_val[x]` assigns the value of the second element in `rev_val` to `val_in`. Since `x` is 2 and `rev_val` must have at least 3 elements, `val_in` is now the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`. The rest of the variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
