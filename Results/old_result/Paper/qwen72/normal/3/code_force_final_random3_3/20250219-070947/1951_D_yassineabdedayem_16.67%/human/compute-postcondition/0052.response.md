The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. The loop can execute one more time if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the next iteration `_` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations, `k` is a positive integer that has been reduced by the sum of all `Min` or `Max` values subtracted from it over the iterations, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations. If `k` is 0, `tab` has all its elements printed, and `i` is the last element of `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0.**
