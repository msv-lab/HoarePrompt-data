Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9 and `k` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, `h` is the index in `D` where the value `right - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, minus 1.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()` and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9 and `k` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, `h` is the index in `D` where the value `right - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, minus 1, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[0]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[0]`. If `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()` and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9 and `k` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` remains the index in `D` where the value `right - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted, minus 1. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` and `l` remains the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated to `D[mid] + F[0]` and `D[mid + 1] + F[0]` respectively.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()` and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9 and `k` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` and `h` are such that `l < h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
