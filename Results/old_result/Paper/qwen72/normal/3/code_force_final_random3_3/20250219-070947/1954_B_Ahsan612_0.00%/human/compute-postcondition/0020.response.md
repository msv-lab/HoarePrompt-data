Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is the fourth element of `ar`, and `minn` is either 1 or infinity.**

Explanation:
- The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of the fourth element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`.
- The initial value of `i` is 3, so `ar[3]` is the fourth element of `ar`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `same`, `minn`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `num` is the fourth element of `ar`.
