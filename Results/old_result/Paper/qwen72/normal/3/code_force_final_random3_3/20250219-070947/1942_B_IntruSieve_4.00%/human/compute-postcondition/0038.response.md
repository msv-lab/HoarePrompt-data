Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the same as the initial `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n).
- `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user.
- `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
- `itm` is the first element in `mex`.
- `minn` is the next integer that has not been added to `mex` or is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used.
- `maxx` is the maximum value in the `mex` list.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(itm, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `itm` and will not move to a new line after printing (due to the `end=' '` parameter).
- `itm` is defined as the first element in the `mex` list.

### Output:
- Since `itm` is the first element in the `mex` list, the output will be the value of the first element in `mex`.

Output: **[itm] (where itm is the first element in the mex list)**
