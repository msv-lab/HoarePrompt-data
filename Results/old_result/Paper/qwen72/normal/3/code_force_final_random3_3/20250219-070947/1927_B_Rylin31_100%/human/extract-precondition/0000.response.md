Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 \le t \le 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the lost string. a is a list of n integers where 0 \le a_i < n, representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and it is guaranteed that a valid string s exists for each trace.**
