Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, and `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ends` will contain all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have only one connection (i.e., their list has a length of 1). The other variables (`n`, `i`, `nodes`, `edges`, and `empty`) will remain unchanged from their initial state.
