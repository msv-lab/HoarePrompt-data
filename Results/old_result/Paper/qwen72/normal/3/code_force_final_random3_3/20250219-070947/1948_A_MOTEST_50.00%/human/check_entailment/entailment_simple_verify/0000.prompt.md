You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) is provided.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())

            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1` (where `t` is the initial number of test cases), and `n` is an input integer for the last test case. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `x`, `ans`, or `j`. If `n` is even and greater than 1, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than 1, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2 + ... + `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` * 2, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the program should print "NO" because it is impossible to have a string with exactly one special character (a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and a single character cannot satisfy this condition). However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for `n = 1` and does not print the string "NO" as required. Additionally, the program uses `os.system('cls')` to clear the console, which is not necessary for the problem and can cause issues on systems that do not support this command (e.g., Unix-based systems). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
