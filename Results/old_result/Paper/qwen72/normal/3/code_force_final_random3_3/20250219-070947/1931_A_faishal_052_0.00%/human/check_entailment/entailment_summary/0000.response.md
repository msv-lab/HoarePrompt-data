Reasoning:

The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to a given sum `lex`. The approach taken by the program is to distribute the sum `lex` among three letters in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order of the resulting word.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**:
   - The program attempts to distribute the sum `lex` by subtracting 26 or 1 from `lex` and appending the corresponding values to the list `arr`. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the correct distribution of the sum to achieve the lexicographically smallest word.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program will append 1, 1, and 22 to `arr`, resulting in the word "aav". However, the correct smallest word should be "cat" (3, 1, 20).

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` after distributing the sum. Sorting the array ensures that the letters are in non-decreasing order, but it does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For instance, "aav" is not the smallest word that sums to 24.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if `lex` is 3, the program will output "aaa" correctly, but for other values, it may not produce the correct result.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the letters are distributed in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order. This can be achieved by starting with the smallest possible letter and incrementally increasing the letters while ensuring the sum remains correct.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the three letters to 'a' (index 1)
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
        # Adjust the letters to match the sum
        while a + b + c < lex:
            if c < 26:
                c += 1
            elif b < 26:
                b += 1
            else:
                a += 1
        # Ensure the sum is exactly `lex`
        if a + b + c > lex:
            c -= 1
        # Print the lexicographically smallest word
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the letters are adjusted in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order while maintaining the correct sum.

Given the issues in the original program, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
