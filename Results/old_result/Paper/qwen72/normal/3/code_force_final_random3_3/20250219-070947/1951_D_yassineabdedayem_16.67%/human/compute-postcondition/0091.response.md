The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables and a list, but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides the following information:
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop and is currently 0.
   - `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string elements, each representing a value of `number` from each iteration.
   - `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop.

2. The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
