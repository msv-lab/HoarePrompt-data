Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` contains a series of tuples, `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are the values from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list, `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`. Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `v1` and `v2` are the values from the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list, `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`. Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, or `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`. `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`. `ops` must contain at least three tuples. `v1` and `v2` are the values from the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list. `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
