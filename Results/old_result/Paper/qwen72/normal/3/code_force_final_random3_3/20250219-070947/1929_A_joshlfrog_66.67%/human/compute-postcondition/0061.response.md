The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `l` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and if `nums[0]` < `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[0]`. If `nums[0]` > 0, then `x` is set to `nums[0]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.**
