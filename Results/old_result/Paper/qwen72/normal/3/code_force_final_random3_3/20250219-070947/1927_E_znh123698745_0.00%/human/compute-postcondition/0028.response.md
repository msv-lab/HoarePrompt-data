The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `k` is a positive integer. After executing this code, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input, but the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list that alternates between the first and last elements of `array` until all elements from 1 to `n` are included, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**
