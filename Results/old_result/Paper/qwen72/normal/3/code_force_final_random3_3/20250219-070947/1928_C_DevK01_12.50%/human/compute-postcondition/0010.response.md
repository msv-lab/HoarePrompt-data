Postcondition: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is 1, `w` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`). The current value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` contains `[w, i]` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `M` contains `[i]`. If `i` is less than `x - 1`, `M` remains unchanged.**
