Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`:**
   - The program calculates `y = n + x`. However, the correct approach should involve checking the position `n` and the number `x` received during the settling. The variable `y` is not used correctly in the context of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find divisors of a number, but it is not used correctly in the context of the problem. The logic inside `func_1` is flawed, particularly in how it checks for divisors and adds them to the list `M`.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Valid `k` Values:**
   - The program attempts to find valid `k` values by checking divisors, but the logic is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The problem requires finding `k` values such that the settling pattern matches the given position and number.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `n` and `x` are such that no valid `k` exists.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the number of valid `k` values that fit the given constraints. The key is to understand the repeating pattern of the settling and how it affects the position and number received.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == (x - 1) % (2 * k - 2):
            count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `count_valid_ks`:**
   - This function iterates over possible values of `k` from 2 to `n`.
   - For each `k`, it checks if the position `n` and the number `x` fit the settling pattern by comparing the remainders of `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2)` and `(x - 1) % (2 * k - 2)`.
   - If the remainders match, it means `k` is a valid value, and the count is incremented.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `count_valid_ks` with the given `n` and `x`.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

This corrected program should correctly determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
