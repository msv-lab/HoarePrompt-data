Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Max` if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string element `str(number)`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Min` if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.** 

The value of `rep` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
