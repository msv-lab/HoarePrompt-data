Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
3. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
4. `b` is a list of integers input by the user.
5. `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be greater than 0.
6. `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0.
7. `d` is `k // 2`.
8. `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.
9. `max(len_a, len_b)` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
10. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1`.
11. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`d` Calculation**:
   - `d` is calculated as `k // 2`, which means `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2. For example, if `k` is 5, then `d` is 2.

2. **`count_a` and `count_b` Calculation**:
   - `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1`.
   - `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1`.

3. **Condition in the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement checks if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES'.
   - If either condition is false, it prints 'NO'.

### Determining the Output:
- **`count_a` and `count_b`**:
  - These values depend on the elements in the lists `a` and `b` and the value of `k`.
  - Without the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `k`, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `count_a` and `count_b`.

- **`d`**:
  - `d` is determined by the value of `k` and is `k // 2`.

- **Final Output**:
  - The output will be 'YES' if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`.
  - The output will be 'NO' if either `count_a` or `count_b` is less than `d`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions given.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES' if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d` (where `d` is `k // 2`), otherwise 'NO'**
