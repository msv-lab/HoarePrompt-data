The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `pl`. The loop iterates over the list `pl`, which contains all unique integers from `palka`. For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least one more unique integer after the current `j`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first unique integer in `pl`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be the second unique integer in `pl`, and `pl` must have at least 2 unique integers.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 2 unique integers, `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`. If `d[j]` is at least 3, `shapes` is the initial value of `shapes` (0) plus the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
