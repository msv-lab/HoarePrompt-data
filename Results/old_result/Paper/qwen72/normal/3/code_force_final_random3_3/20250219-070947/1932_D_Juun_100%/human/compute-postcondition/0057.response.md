Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value set to a non-`None` value, `answers` is a list containing strings, each of which represents a pair of cards where the first card is a non-trump card with the same suit as the key in the `suits` dictionary and the second card is a trump card, sorted by their ranks and joined with a space. If `trumps` was empty before the loop started or became empty during the loop, the program printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned without completing the loop.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `n` remains an integer between 1 and 16.
- The variable `trump_suit` remains a character from "CDHS".
- The variable `cards` remains a list of 2n unique two-character strings.
- The variable `trump` remains the input string representing the trump suit.
- The list `trumps` is now empty, as all its elements have been popped.
- The dictionary `suits` still has the keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S', and at least one of these values is set to a non-`None` value.
- The list `answers` contains strings, each representing a pair of cards where the first card is a non-trump card with the same suit as the key in the `suits` dictionary, and the second card is a trump card. These pairs are sorted by their ranks and joined with a space.
- If `trumps` was empty before the loop started or became empty during the loop, the program printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned without completing the loop.
