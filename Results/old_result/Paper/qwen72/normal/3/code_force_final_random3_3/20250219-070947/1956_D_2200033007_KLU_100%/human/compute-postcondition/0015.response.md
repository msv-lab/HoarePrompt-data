Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i == 0`, `j` is `0`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + 1]` is not equal to its index (i.e., `arr[start_index] != 0`).**
