Postcondition: ***`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`. If `possible` is True, it indicates that at least one character in `c` is not equal to the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`). If `possible` is False, it indicates that all characters in `c` are equal to the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` (and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`).***
