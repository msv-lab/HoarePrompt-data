Postcondition: ***`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1]` and `lex` is an input integer minus 1, with the current value of `lex` being less than or equal to 25. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, and `lex` is updated to the input integer minus 26, with the current value of `lex` being greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` is between 0 and 26 (exclusive), `lex` remains an input integer within this range.***
