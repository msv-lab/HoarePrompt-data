Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is `N`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `ppp` is 23 if `tc` is greater than 5.
   - `s` is greater than `l`.
   - The current value of `s` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print(-1, -1)` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - It simply prints the integers `-1` and `-1`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the print statement is independent of the initial state and always prints the same values, the output will be:
   Output: **-1, -1**
