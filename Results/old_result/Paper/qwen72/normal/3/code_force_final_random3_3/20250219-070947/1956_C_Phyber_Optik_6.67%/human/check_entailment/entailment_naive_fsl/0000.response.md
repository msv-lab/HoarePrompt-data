Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `n = 1`. According to the problem description, for `n = 1`, the maximum sum should be 1, and the number of operations should be 1. However, the program outputs `1 1` for the sum and the number of operations, but then it incorrectly prints `1 1 1` for the operation, which is not a valid operation for a 1x1 matrix. The correct output for `n = 1` should be:

```
1 1
1 1 1
```

But the program prints:

```
1 1
1 1 1
```

This is incorrect because the operation `1 1 1` is not needed for a 1x1 matrix to achieve the maximum sum of 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
