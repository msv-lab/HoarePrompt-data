#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `ans` is increased by the sum of each value in `cnt` divided by 4 (using integer division).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the described operations.
    #   - Based on the example, `ans` will be 1.
    #
    #Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can generalize the output based on the structure of the problem:
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then calculates the number of complete sets of four sticks of the same length that can be formed from the list `a`. The function prints this count and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input list `a` remains unchanged, and the count of complete sets of four sticks is printed to the console.
