Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. `_` is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, meaning a loop will run a number of times equal to the integer input provided by the user. The input must be greater than 0.
2. `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the user input. This implies that the user provides two integers separated by a space.
3. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. This suggests that `arr` is a sorted list of tuples.
4. `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Here, `LA` is the length of the list `arr`.
5. `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.

Given the code snippet:
```
print(-1, -1)
```

This `print` statement is hardcoded to print the values `-1` and `-1`, regardless of the initial state. The values of `s` and `e` are not used in this print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **-1, -1**
