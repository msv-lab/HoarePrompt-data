Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the number of screens required for the applications. Specifically, the issue lies in the calculation of `x` after accounting for the 2x2 icons:

```python
x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
```

This line is incorrect because it subtracts the number of 1x1 icons that could fit in the space occupied by 2x2 icons and then adds the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons. This does not correctly account for the space used by 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons.

A correct approach would be to first place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the screens, then place the remaining 1x1 icons on the available space. The correct logic should be:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space on those screens for 1x1 icons.
3. Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_2(x, y):
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
    
    # Calculate the remaining space on those screens for 1x1 icons
    total_cells_for_2x2 = screens_for_2x2 * 15
    cells_used_by_2x2 = y * 4
    remaining_cells_for_1x1 = total_cells_for_2x2 - cells_used_by_2x2
    
    # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
    remaining_1x1_icons = max(0, x - remaining_cells_for_1x1)
    
    # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
    additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1_icons / 15)
    
    # Total screens needed
    total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
    
    return total_screens

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_2(x, y))

func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the 2x2 icons are placed first, and then the remaining 1x1 icons are placed on the available space, correctly calculating the minimum number of screens needed.
