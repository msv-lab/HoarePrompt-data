Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is the initial value of `sum` plus \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is increased by \( i \times n \). If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 + i \times n \) and `r` is 1. If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \), then `sum` is \( 2 \times (i \times n) \) and `r` is 0.**
