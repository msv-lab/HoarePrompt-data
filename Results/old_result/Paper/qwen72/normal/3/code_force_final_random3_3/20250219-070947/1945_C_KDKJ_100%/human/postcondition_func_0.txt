The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1' from the user. It then calculates and prints an integer `ans` which represents the index `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n) that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`, while ensuring that the number of '0's on the left side of `i` is at least half the length of the left side, and the number of '1's on the right side of `i` is at least half the length of the right side. The function does not return any value.
