### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - If `x_a > x_b` or `h == 1`, the function appends 'Draw' to the answers list. This is correct because:
     - If `x_a > x_b`, Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, and neither can move to the same row to capture the other.
     - If `h == 1`, the board has only one row, and neither player can move, resulting in a draw.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The function checks the parity of `x_a` and `x_b` (whether they are even or odd). This is a key part of the logic because the parity of the row numbers can determine the outcome of the game.
   - If both `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity, the function further checks the column positions:
     - If `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins because he can always move to the same column as Alice, and Alice cannot avoid a capture.
     - If `y_a < y_b`, the function checks the distance between the chips and the number of moves required to reach the same row:
       - If the distance is greater than 1 and either chip can move to a position that avoids capture, the game is a draw.
       - Otherwise, Bob wins.
     - If `y_a > y_b`, similar logic is applied to determine if the game is a draw or Bob wins.

4. **Different Parity**:
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities, the function checks the column positions:
     - If `y_a == y_b`, Alice wins because she can always move to the same column as Bob, and Bob cannot avoid a capture.
     - If `y_a < y_b`, the function checks the distance between the chips and the number of moves required to reach the same row:
       - If the distance is greater than 1 and either chip can move to a position that avoids capture, the game is a draw.
       - Otherwise, Alice wins.
     - If `y_a > y_b`, similar logic is applied to determine if the game is a draw or Alice wins.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case after processing all of them. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given problem description. The conditions and checks are consistent with the rules of the game, and the function handles all edge cases and scenarios as described.

Correctness: **True**
