Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[1]`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `i` is 1, and `((-1)` is incomplete.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value at index `a[0]` of `array` to the list `answer`.
- `a[0]` is 1, so `array[1]` is appended to `answer`.
- Initially, `answer` contains the integer 1. After appending `array[1]`, `answer` now contains the integers 1 and `array[1]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `array`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The expression `((-1)` is incomplete and does not affect the state of the program.
