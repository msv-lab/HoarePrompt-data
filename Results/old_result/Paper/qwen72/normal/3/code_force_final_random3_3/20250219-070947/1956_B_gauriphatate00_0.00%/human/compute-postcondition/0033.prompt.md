You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended `t` times.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` must have at least `t` elements, and each `result` in the loop is the corresponding element in `results` from the first to the `t`-th element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` and appears at most twice. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
