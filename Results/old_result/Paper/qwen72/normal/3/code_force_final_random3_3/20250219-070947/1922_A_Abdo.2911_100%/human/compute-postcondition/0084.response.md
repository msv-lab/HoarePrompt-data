Postcondition: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`, and `possible` is True because at least one character in `c` is not equal to the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`).**
