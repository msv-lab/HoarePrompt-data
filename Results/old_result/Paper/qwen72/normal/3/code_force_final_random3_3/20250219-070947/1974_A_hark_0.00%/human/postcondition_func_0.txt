The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are values of any type that can be compared using the less than (<) operator. It returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the returned value is the minimum of the two input values.
