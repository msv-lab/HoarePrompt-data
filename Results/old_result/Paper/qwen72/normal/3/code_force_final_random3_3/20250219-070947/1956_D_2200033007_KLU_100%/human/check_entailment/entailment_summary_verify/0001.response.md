### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations that replace a subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) with the MEX of the subarray.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX. Instead, it uses a formula that does not align with the definition of MEX.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach with memoization to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) after performing the operations.
   - `func_1` is intended to compute the maximum sum for the subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) and uses memoization to store results in `res_dict`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It uses a formula to compute the maximum sum that does not correctly reflect the MEX operation.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The function is designed to compute the maximum sum for the subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \).
     - It uses memoization to store results of subproblems in `res_dict`.
     - The base case for a subarray of length 1 is incorrect. It should return the MEX of the subarray, not `max(1, arr[start_index])`.
     - The recursive computation does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. It uses a formula that does not reflect the MEX operation.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
     - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum for the subarray.
     - It then tries to find the optimal split that achieves this sum and recursively constructs the operations for the split subarrays.
     - Since `func_1` is incorrect, the operations constructed by `func_2` are also incorrect.

   - **`make_stairs`**:
     - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where the elements are \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, i \).
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern.
     - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and applies the MEX operation.
     - The function does not correctly handle the transformation and MEX calculation. It assumes that the MEX of a subarray of length \( i \) is \( i \), which is not always true.

5. **MEX Calculation Error**:
   - The MEX calculation in the program is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the program uses a different formula that does not correctly compute the MEX.
   - For example, in the subarray `[1, 3, 9]`, the MEX is `0`, but the program does not correctly compute this.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX, which is a fundamental part of the problem.
   - The operations constructed by `func_2` and `make_stairs` are based on the incorrect MEX calculation, leading to incorrect results.
   - The program's logic for splitting the subarray and computing the maximum sum is flawed due to the incorrect MEX calculation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the MEX, which is essential for the problem. Therefore, the operations and the maximum sum calculated by the program are incorrect.

Final: **False**
