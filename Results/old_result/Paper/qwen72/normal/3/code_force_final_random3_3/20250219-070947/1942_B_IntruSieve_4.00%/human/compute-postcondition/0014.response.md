Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the value `abs(arr[0] - minn)`, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, `arr[0]` is less than or equal to 0, and the absolute difference between `arr[0]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`.**
