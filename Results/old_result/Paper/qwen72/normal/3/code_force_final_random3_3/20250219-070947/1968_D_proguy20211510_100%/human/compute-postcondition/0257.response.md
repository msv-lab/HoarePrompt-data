Output State: **`i` is 2, `pathb` is a list containing at least three elements, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[2]`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`. If `k` < 3, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The list `pathb` still contains at least three elements.
- The value of `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[2]`.
- The value of `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`.
- The value of `resb` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr`.
- If `k` is less than 3, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, but the values of the variables remain unchanged.
