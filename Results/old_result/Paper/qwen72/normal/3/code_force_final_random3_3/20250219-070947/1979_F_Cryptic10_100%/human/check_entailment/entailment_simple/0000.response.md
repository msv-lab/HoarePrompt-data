### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query of the form `"? d"` returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( w \) that is not connected to \( v \) (or 0 if no such vertex exists).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes a set `vx` containing all vertices from 1 to \( n \) and an empty list `ops` to store the operations (queries and their results).

3. **Query Loop:**
   - The loop continues until there are more than 2 vertices left in `vx`.
   - For each query, it asks for a vertex with a degree at least \( \text{len}(vx) - 2 \).
   - If the interactor returns a vertex \( v1 \) and another vertex \( v2 \) (where \( v2 \) is not connected to \( v1 \)), it removes \( v1 \) from `vx` and appends the tuple \((v1, v2)\) to `ops`.
   - If \( v2 \) is 0, it makes another query with \( d = 0 \) to find a vertex with the minimum degree and removes it from `vx`. It then appends the tuples \((v3, 0)\) and \((v1, 0)\) to `ops`.

4. **Constructing the Hamiltonian Path:**
   - After the loop, `vx` contains exactly 2 vertices, which are the starting points of the Hamiltonian path.
   - The program then iterates through the `ops` list in reverse order, appending each \( v1 \) to `p1` or `p2` based on whether \( p1[-1] \) is equal to \( v2 \).
   - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path by concatenating `p1` in reverse order with `p2`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the interaction with the interactor by making queries and processing the responses.
   - It ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \( n \) by removing vertices from `vx` and appending operations to `ops`.
   - The construction of the Hamiltonian path is based on the results of the queries, and the logic for appending vertices to `p1` or `p2` is sound.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the specified number of queries. The logic and interaction with the interactor are handled appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
