Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in `cards` that have the same suit as `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `answers` is a list containing strings, each of which represents a pair of cards that were not trumps and had the same suit, sorted by their ranks and joined with a space.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`trump_suit`**: The value of `trump_suit` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cards`**: The list `cards` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`trump`**: The value of `trump` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`trumps`**: This list now contains all the ranks of the cards in `cards` that have the same suit as `trump`.
- **`suits`**: The dictionary `suits` has all values set to `None` because each suit is only set to a rank once, and if a second card of the same suit is encountered, the value is reset to `None`.
- **`answers`**: This list contains strings, each representing a pair of cards that were not trumps and had the same suit. The ranks of these pairs are sorted and joined with a space. Each pair is added to `answers` only if a second card of the same suit is encountered.
