The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `m`: integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the size of the lists and a threshold value, respectively.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the first list of integers.
- `b`: a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the second list of integers.

The function returns different outputs based on the input values:
- Case_1: If the sum of `n` over all test cases exceeds 2 × 10^5, the function returns an error message indicating that the total size of the lists is too large.
- Case_2: For each test case, if the sum of the first `m` elements of list `a` is greater than the sum of the first `m` elements of list `b`, the function returns "List A is greater."
- Case_3: For each test case, if the sum of the first `m` elements of list `b` is greater than the sum of the first `m` elements of list `a`, the function returns "List B is greater."
- Case_4: For each test case, if the sums of the first `m` elements of both lists `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns "Lists are equal."

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. It returns an error message if the total size of the lists exceeds 2 × 10^5. For each test case, it compares the sums of the first `m` elements of lists `a` and `b`. If the sum of the first `m` elements of `a` is greater, it returns "List A is greater." If the sum of the first `m` elements of `b` is greater, it returns "List B is greater." If the sums are equal, it returns "Lists are equal."**
