To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`. The loop will execute if `adv` is greater than 0. The state of `j` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range(adv)` function.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `len(a)` remains the same
- `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`

For the loop to execute, `adv` must be greater than 0. The value of `adv` is determined by the minimum of three values: `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. Therefore, we need to ensure that at least one of these values is greater than 0.

Since `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`. If `a[i - 1]` is strictly greater than `a[i]`, then `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` will be a positive integer. This means that `adv` can be positive if `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` is positive, and either `cnt` or `cur` is positive.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `adv` is greater than 0. We can achieve this by ensuring that `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` is positive, and either `cnt` or `cur` is positive.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` remains the same, `adv` is greater than 0**
