### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to keep track of whether Alice or Bob wins.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes using `set(arr)` and then sorting it.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. Therefore, the function returns "Alice" in this case.

4. **Checking for Consecutive Pile Sizes:**
   - The program then checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. If there is a gap between any two consecutive pile sizes, the game can be won by the player whose turn it is when the gap is encountered.
   - The variable `not_c` is used to check if the pile sizes are consecutive. If they are not, `not_c` is set to `False`.
   - The variable `A` is toggled for each consecutive pile size, effectively simulating the turns of the game.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the final value of `A` is toggled one more time to determine the winner.
   - The function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Initial Check:**
  - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. This is correct.

- **Correctness of the Consecutive Check:**
  - The program correctly identifies if the pile sizes are consecutive.
  - The toggling of `A` for each consecutive pile size simulates the turns of the game.
  - The final toggling of `A` when the pile sizes are consecutive is necessary to determine the winner correctly.

### Issues:
- **Variable `n` is not used:**
  - The variable `n` (number of piles) is read but not used in the function `func_1`. This is not a correctness issue but a minor inefficiency.

- **Potential Off-by-One Error:**
  - The loop `for i in range(1, len(set_))` correctly checks the difference between consecutive pile sizes. However, the initial value of `A` is set to `False`, which might lead to an off-by-one error in the toggling logic.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly identifies the winner based on the given problem description and logic.
- The initial check and the consecutive check are implemented correctly.
- The final toggling of `A` is necessary and correctly implemented.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
