Output State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1]`, `output2` is a list containing `[x]`, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `x / i` to the list `output2`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `x / i` is simply `x`, and it is converted to an integer (which is `x` itself, as `x` is already an integer). Therefore, `output2` now contains `[x]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
