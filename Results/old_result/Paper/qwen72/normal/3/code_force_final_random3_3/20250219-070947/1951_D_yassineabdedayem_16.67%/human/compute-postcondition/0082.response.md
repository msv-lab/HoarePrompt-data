Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is `k - Max`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(Min)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` remains 1.
- `n` remains non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
- `rep` remains 2.
- `tab` remains a list containing two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(Min)`.
- `Min` remains `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` remains `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- `number` remains `Min`.
- `n` remains `n - Min * Max`.
