Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle each test case by reading the length of the strip `m` and the strip itself `s`, and then calculating the minimum segment length.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Redundant Input Reading**: The variable `m` is read inside `func_1`, but it is not used in the calculation. The length of the strip `s` is already known from the `n` read in the main loop, so reading `m` is unnecessary and could lead to confusion.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Segment Length**: The function calculates the distance between the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` and returns this distance plus 2. This is incorrect because the length of the segment to be painted should be the difference between the positions of the last and first 'B' plus 1, not plus 2.

3. **Potential Off-by-One Error**: The positions `mi` and `ma` are calculated based on the 1-indexed position of 'B' in the string, but the length calculation should be based on 0-indexed positions to avoid an off-by-one error.

4. **Global Variable `n`**: The function `func_1` is called without passing any parameters, and it relies on the global variable `n` which is not used within the function. This is a poor practice and can lead to bugs.

5. **Input Handling**: The input handling in the main loop is incorrect. The function `func_1` should be called with the strip length and the strip string as parameters, but it is called without any arguments.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
