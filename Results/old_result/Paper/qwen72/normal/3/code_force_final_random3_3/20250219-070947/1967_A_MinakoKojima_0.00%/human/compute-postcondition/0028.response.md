Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers, both greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.
- `ans` is initially set to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
if k >= n * m:
    ans = math.factorial(n)
else:
    ans = a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])
    i = n - 1
    k = k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `m`**:
   - `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.

2. **Check the Condition**:
   - The code checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m` (`k >= n * m`).

3. **Set `ans`**:
   - If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`.
   - If `k < n * m`, then `ans` is set to a product of differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`.

4. **Update `k` and `a`**:
   - If `k < n * m`, the code updates `k` and each element of `a`:
     - `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`.
     - Each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

### Output Determination:

- **Case 1: `k >= n * m`**:
  - `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`.
  - The `print(ans)` statement will print the factorial of `n`.

- **Case 2: `k < n * m`**:
  - `ans` is set to the product of differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`.
  - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values in `a` and the value of `k`.
  - After setting `ans`, the code updates `k` and each element of `a` based on the formula provided.

### Final Output:

- If `k >= n * m`, the output will be the factorial of `n`.
- If `k < n * m`, the output will be the product of differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans` in the second case. However, we can describe it based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is `math.factorial(n)` if `k >= n * m`, otherwise ans is the product of differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`)**
