Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input strings, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is False, then `no_path` remains False if any character at an odd index (1, 3, 5, ..., `k-1`) in `a` is not `>`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True. If `no_path` is True, then `no_path` remains True.***
