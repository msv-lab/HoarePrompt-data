Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended `t` times.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times, and `t` is decremented by 1 with each iteration.
- **`n`**: `n` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, but its value will be the last `n` used in the final iteration of the loop.
- **`a`**: `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is derived from the corresponding string in the `data` list. This list `a` will be the one used in the final iteration of the loop.
- **`data`**: The `data` list remains unchanged; it is still the list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
- **`idx`**: The index `idx` will be updated to `1 + t * (1 + n)`, where `t` is the initial value of `t` and `n` is the last value of `n` used in the loop. This is because `idx` is incremented by `1 + n` in each iteration, and the loop runs `t` times.
- **`results`**: The `results` list will contain the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended `t` times, where `t` is the initial value of `t`. Each result corresponds to one iteration of the loop.
