Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. MOD is 1000000006.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has completed all iterations. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer provided by the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is updated to `ans % m % MOD` based on the loop conditions, `ans` is the final value of `n * m` after being modified by the loop, `i` is `m`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - (n - 1 - l)`, and `k` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is 0, `res` is a list of length `n - 1` where each element is `ans % m % MOD` based on the corresponding update of `ans` during each iteration, and `ans` is the final value after all updates based on the characters in `s` from index 0 to `n-2`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `k` (0 ≤ k < n) is `ans % m % MOD` after the corresponding iteration, and the rest of the elements in `res` are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except those that were divided out during the iterations, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user, and `k` is `n - 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
