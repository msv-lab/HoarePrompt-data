Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is updated to `arr[median_index]` (the new median after sorting), `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, and `heap` is now a min-heap, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**
