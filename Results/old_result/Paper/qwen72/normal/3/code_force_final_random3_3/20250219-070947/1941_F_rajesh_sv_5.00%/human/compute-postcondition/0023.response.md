Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, if `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, `index` is set to 3, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` is None, and if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` <= `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
