Output State: **`pathb` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `resb` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the value of `curr`.
- The previous value of `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`.
- The value of `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`.
- The value of `preb` is `preb + pathb[0] + pathb[1]`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (if `k` is less than 2) is still valid and unchanged.
