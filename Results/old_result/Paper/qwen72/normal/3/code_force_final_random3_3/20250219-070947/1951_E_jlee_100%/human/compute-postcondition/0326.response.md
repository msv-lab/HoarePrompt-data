Based on the initial state:

- `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The first character of `string` is not equal to the last character of `string`.

The `print(string)` statement will print the entire `string`.

Since the exact value of `string` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given conditions. The string must have a length greater than 0, and its first character must be different from its last character.

Output: **string (where string is a non-empty string with its first character not equal to its last character)**
