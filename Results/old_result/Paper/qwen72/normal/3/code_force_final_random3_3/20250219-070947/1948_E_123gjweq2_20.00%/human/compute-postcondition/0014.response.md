To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `not_mid`. The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0. Let's break down the state adjustments needed:

1. **`not_mid` must be greater than 0**: This is the primary condition for the loop to execute. Given that `not_mid` is defined as `right - left + 1 - mid`, we need to ensure that this expression evaluates to a value greater than 0.
2. **`i` is `mid - 1`**: This is the initial state of `i` before the loop starts. However, in the loop head, `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust this.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0).
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.
- `i` is `mid - 1`.
- `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `not_mid` is greater than 0. Let's re-evaluate the state:

- `left` and `right` remain non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`.
- `clique` remains a positive integer.
- `small_element` remains `left + 1`.
- `big_element` remains `right + 1`.
- `mid` remains `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0).
- `not_mid` must be greater than 0, so `right - left + 1 - mid > 0`.
- `i` is 0 (as it will be set to 0 at the start of the loop).

Given the above, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0. This can be achieved if `right - left + 1` is greater than `mid`.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 0), `i` is 0, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, and `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`.**
