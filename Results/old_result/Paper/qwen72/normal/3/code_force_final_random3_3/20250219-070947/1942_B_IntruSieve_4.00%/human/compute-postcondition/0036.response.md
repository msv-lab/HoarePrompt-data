Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers that has been constructed based on the conditions in the loop, `minn` is the next integer that has not been added to `mex` or is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used, and `maxx` is the maximum value in the `mex` list.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`t` and `test_cases`**: These variables are not affected by the loop and remain as they were in the initial state.
- **`arr`**: The input list `arr` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified.
- **`mex`**: This list is populated with integers based on the conditions in the loop. If `arr[i]` is positive, the smallest non-negative integer not in `mex` (tracked by `minn`) is appended to `mex`. If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the absolute value of `arr[i] - minn` is appended to `mex`.
- **`minn`**: This variable tracks the smallest non-negative integer not yet added to `mex`. If all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used, `minn` will be 0.
- **`maxx`**: This variable tracks the maximum value in the `mex` list. It is updated whenever a new value is appended to `mex` and that value is greater than the current `maxx`.
