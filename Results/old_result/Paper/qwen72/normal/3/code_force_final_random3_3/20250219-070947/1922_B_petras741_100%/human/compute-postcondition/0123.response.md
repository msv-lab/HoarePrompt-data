Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1 (not used in the code snippet).
- `i` is 2 (not used in the code snippet).
- `buffer` is an empty list (not used in the code snippet).
- `w` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- `j` is `n` (not used in the code snippet).
- `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.
- `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.
- `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.
- `eta_ln` is 1.

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is the length of the list `w` minus 1. It is given that `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. **`q`**: This is a list of `n + 1` zeros. For each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1. This means `q` will have a count of how many times each integer in `w` appears.
3. **`eta`**: This list contains all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0. Given that `eta_ln` is 1, there is exactly one unique integer in `w` that appears at least once.
4. **`rho`**: This is the count of the unique integer in `w` that appears at least once. Since `eta` contains only one index, `rho` is the count of the integer at that index.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

### Calculation:
- The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, which is the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{3}\).

### Given:
- `eta_ln` is 1, which means there is exactly one unique integer in `w` that appears at least once.
- Since `eta_ln` is 1, `w` must contain exactly one unique integer repeated `n` times.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `n` is the length of the list `w` minus 1.
- The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` will compute the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items.

### Final Output:
Since `n` is the length of the list `w` minus 1, the output will be the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the length of the list `w` minus 1)**
