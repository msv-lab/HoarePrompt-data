Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `ress` is 0, `resb` is 0, `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index where the loop breaks, `ps` is the index where the loop breaks, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, ..., up to the point where the loop breaks, `paths` is a list containing the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, ..., up to the point where the loop breaks, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[0]`, if `k` is less than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `resb` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `pathb` is a list containing at least two elements, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[1]`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, and if `k` is less than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `pathb` is a list containing at least three elements, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[2]`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`. If `k` < 3, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
