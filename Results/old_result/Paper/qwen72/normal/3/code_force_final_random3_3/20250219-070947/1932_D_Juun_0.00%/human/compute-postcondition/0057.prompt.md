Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The number of rounds `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings where each card string is two characters long, the first character being one of "23456789" and the second being one of "CDHS". After all iterations, `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit, where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order, followed by the suit, and separated by a space. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None` because each suit is reset to `None` after processing a pair.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to something other than `None`, `suit` is one of the keys in `suits` with a non-`None` value, `trumps` is a non-empty list, `answers` is a list that now includes the string formed by concatenating `rank`, `suit`, the last element of `trumps` (which has been removed from `trumps`), and `trump`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to something other than `None`, `suit` is the next key in `suits` with a non-`None` value, `rank` is the corresponding non-`None` value for the next `suit`. If `trumps` is not empty, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element, and `answers` is a list that now includes an additional string formed by concatenating `rank`, `suit`, the last element of `trumps` (which has been removed from `trumps`), and `trump`. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to something other than `None`. If `trumps` is not empty, `rank` is the corresponding non-`None` value for the next `suit`, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element, and `answers` is a list that now includes an additional string formed by concatenating `rank`, `suit`, the last element of `trumps` (which has been removed from `trumps`), and `trump`. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
