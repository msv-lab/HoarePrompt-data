The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `j` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0. Since `j` is 4 and `n` is greater than 3, the loop can execute again if `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 5, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
