Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the element 26, `k` is 2, and `lex` is an integer. If `lex` is between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is reduced by 26.***
