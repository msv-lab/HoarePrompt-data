The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State:** 
  - `t` is greater than 2.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `n` is an input integer.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the string `'NO'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
