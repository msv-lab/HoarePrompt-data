The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0), `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
