Output State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `sum, r = 0, 0` reassigns the values of `sum` and `r` to 0.
- The initial values of `j`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The initial value of `n` remains a new input integer greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` remains `n`.
- The initial value of `r` was the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, but it is now 0.
- The initial value of `sum` was the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, but it is now 0.
