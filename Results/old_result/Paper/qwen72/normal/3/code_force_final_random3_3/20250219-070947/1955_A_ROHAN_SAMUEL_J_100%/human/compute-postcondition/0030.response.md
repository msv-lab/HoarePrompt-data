Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `a` is the second integer from the new input.
   - `b` is the third integer from the new input.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(n // 2 * b)`.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The expression `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division.
   - The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be \( \frac{n}{2} \).
   - If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be \( \frac{n - 1}{2} \).

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `n // 2 * b`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is the first integer from the new input and b is the third integer from the new input)**
