### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by clearing the screen using `os.system('cls')`. This is not necessary for the problem and can be omitted, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - For each test case, the program reads an integer `n`.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because if a character is special, it must have a neighbor that is the same, and this neighbor will also be special, making it impossible to have exactly one special character.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is not 1, the program constructs a string `ans` to meet the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs the string by repeating each character from the uppercase alphabet twice, `n // 2` times. This ensures that each pair of repeated characters forms two special characters, and the total number of special characters is `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with the string 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to repeat each character from the uppercase alphabet twice, `n // 2 - 1` times. This ensures that the total number of special characters is `n` (3 from 'AAA' plus 2 for each additional pair).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans` if a valid string can be constructed.
   - The length of the constructed string is at most 200, which meets the problem's requirement.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the special case where `n == 1`.
- The string construction logic for even and odd `n` values ensures that the resulting string has exactly `n` special characters.
- The program prints the correct output format for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
