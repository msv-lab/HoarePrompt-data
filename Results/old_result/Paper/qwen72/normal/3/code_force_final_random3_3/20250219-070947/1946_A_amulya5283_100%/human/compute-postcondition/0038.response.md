Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a` and must be at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is 1 or 2 depending on the previous iteration's condition if `a[mdx] == a[i]`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's condition.***
