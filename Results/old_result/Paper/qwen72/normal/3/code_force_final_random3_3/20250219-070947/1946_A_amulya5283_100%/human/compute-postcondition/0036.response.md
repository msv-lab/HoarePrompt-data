To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables that are part of the loop head: `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. Let's break down the adjustments step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an input integer minus 3.
   - `n` is the length of the sorted list `a` and must be at least 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` starts at `mdx`.
   - If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(mdx, n):
   ```

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from `mdx` and goes up to `n-1` (since `range(mdx, n)` does not include `n`).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was at some value within the range `[mdx, n-1]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `mdx` and `n` remain the same.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is `mdx` at the start of the first iteration.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be `mdx + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a` and must be at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's condition.**
