Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is 3, and `nx` is a string. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`), then `nx` is either 'FSF' or 'SSF'. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'FSS' or 'SSS'.**
