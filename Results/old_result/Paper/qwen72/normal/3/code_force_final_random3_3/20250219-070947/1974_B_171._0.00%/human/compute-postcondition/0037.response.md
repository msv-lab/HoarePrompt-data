Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `mapping` contains the entry `{'a': char}` if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. `decoded` is a list containing the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. The loop has executed, and `c` is 97 (ord('a')). If `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now contains the entry `{'a': char}`, and `chr(97)` ('a') is in `mapping.values()`. The loop terminates after the first iteration because `chr(97)` ('a') is added to `mapping.values()`, and the condition `chr(c) not in mapping.values()` is no longer met for subsequent iterations.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing, the `encoded` string remains unchanged, and `char` is still the second character in `encoded`. The `mapping` dictionary now contains the entry `{'a': char}` if 'a' was not already in `mapping.values()`. The `decoded` list contains the character 'a' if `char` was not in `mapping` and 'a' was not in `mapping.values()`. The loop variable `c` is 97 (which corresponds to 'a' in ASCII). The loop terminates after the first iteration because 'a' is added to `mapping.values()`, and the condition for further iterations is no longer satisfied.
