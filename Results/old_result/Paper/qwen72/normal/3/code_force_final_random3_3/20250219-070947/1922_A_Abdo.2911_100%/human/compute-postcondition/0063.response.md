Postcondition: ***`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 0, `possible` is False if the first element of `c` is equal to the first element of `a` or the first element of `b`. If the first element of `c` is not equal to the first element of `a` or the first element of `b`, `possible` is True. The first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `b`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence if `possible` is False, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
