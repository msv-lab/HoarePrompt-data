The code snippet `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in ascending order based on the elements of the inner lists. The sorting is done in-place, meaning the list `set_` itself is modified and no new list is created. The other variables (`arr`, `A`, `t`, `n`, `a_i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The length of `arr` is `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, the number of piles `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) and the number of stones in each pile `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) are such that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `A` is False. `set_` is a list of unique lists from `arr`, and it is now sorted in ascending order.**
