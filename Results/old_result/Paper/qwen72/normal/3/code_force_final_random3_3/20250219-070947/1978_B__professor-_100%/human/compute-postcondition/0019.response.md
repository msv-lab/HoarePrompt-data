The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `t`. The loop will execute again as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `_` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`.

Given that `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, and the loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`, we can conclude that for the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` still holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`**
