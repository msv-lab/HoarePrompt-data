Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m` and adds 2 to the result. However, this approach does not account for the overlap of visibility times correctly and does not consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. **Visibility Overlap**: A firework launched at time `x` is visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive. We need to find the maximum number of such intervals that overlap at any given minute.
2. **LCM Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` will help us determine the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
3. **Maximum Overlap**: We need to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at any minute, considering the visibility intervals and the LCM.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def max_fireworks(a, b, m):
    # Calculate the LCM of a and b
    l = lcm(a, b)
    
    # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within m + 1 minutes
    count_a = (m + 1) // a
    count_b = (m + 1) // b
    
    # Calculate the number of simultaneous launches within m + 1 minutes
    count_both = (m + 1) // l
    
    # The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
    max_visible = count_a + count_b - count_both
    return max_visible

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(max_fireworks(a, b, m))
```

### Explanation:
1. **LCM Calculation**: The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, which is used in the LCM calculation.
3. **Counting Fireworks**: We count the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m + 1` minutes.
4. **Simultaneous Launches**: We subtract the number of simultaneous launches (where both installations launch a firework at the same time) to avoid double-counting.
5. **Output**: The result is the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

This corrected program should handle the problem as described and produce the correct output for the given test cases.
