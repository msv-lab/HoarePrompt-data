Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `func` is not properly defined, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference is not 2 and is an even number, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If the difference between the third element (`a[2]`) and the second element (`a[1]`) of the list `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1 and `tmp` remains undefined. If the difference is not 2 but is an even number, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 4 elements, and `i` is 3. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1 and `tmp` remains as defined in the previous iteration. Otherwise, `ans` remains as defined in the previous iteration, and if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` now contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
