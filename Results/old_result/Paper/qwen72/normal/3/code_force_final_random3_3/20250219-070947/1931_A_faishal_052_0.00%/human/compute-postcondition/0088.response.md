Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2]. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52].**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `k` has been incremented to 3, while the other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged. The array `arr` still contains the same values it had at the start of the loop, depending on the value of `lex`. The loop has printed three characters corresponding to the values in `arr` converted to their respective lowercase letters.
