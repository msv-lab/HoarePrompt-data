Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is 3, `w` is greater than or equal to 3. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[3, q // 3]`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.***
