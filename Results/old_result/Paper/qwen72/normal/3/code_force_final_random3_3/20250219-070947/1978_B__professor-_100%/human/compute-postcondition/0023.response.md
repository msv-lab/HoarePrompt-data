Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` still holds.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.
- `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `b - a`**:
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b - a` is a non-positive integer.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is a positive integer and can be either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.

2. **Calculate the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`**:
   - This expression calculates the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers.
   - For a non-positive `b - a`, the sum is 0.
   - For a positive `b - a`, the sum is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).

3. **Calculate the expression `a * n`**:
   - This is simply the product of `a` and `n`.

4. **Combine the results**:
   - The final value to be printed is the integer result of the expression \((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n\).

### Final Output:
- The output will be the integer value of the expression \((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n\).

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the calculated value of the expression.

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n) (where `b - a` is the difference between `b` and `a`, and `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`)**
