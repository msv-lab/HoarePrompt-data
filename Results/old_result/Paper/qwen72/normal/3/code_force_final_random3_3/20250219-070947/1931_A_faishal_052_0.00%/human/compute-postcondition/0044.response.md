Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `k` is 2**

Natural language description: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `k` will be 2, which is the last value it takes in the loop. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
