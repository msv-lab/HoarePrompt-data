Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the two installations launch fireworks at the same time. The program calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation separately and then adds them together, which is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap where both installations launch a firework at the same time.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6 7 42
```
The program will calculate:
- `A = int(42 / 6) + 1 = 8`
- `B = int(42 / 7) + 1 = 7`

So it will output `A + B = 8 + 7 = 15`.

However, the correct answer should be 14 because at the 42nd minute, both installations will launch a firework, but this firework will only be counted once in the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks. The program should account for this overlap to provide the correct result.
