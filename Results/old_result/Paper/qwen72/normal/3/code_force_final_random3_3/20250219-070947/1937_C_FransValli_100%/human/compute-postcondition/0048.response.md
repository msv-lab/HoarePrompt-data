Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` is greater than 0, which means `n` is a positive integer.
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is the largest integer less than `n`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=' and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`.
   - The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the console.

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr`, which is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '='.
   - `item` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code. Since it is not provided, we will describe it as an unknown integer.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the value of `mini` twice, and the value of `item` twice.
   - Since `mini` is the first element of `arr`, it is an integer that satisfies the condition of being either '<' or '=' in the input `res`.
   - `item` is an unknown integer.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of the list `arr` and [item] is an unknown integer)**
