Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string element. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `tab` contains `str(Min)`, `k` is updated to `k - Max`, and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `tab` contains `str(Max)`, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and `number` is `Max`.**
