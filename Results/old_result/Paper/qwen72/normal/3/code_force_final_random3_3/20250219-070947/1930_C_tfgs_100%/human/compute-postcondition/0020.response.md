To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to continue.

The loop head is:
```
for j in range(adv):
```

The variables in the loop head are `j` and `adv`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `adv`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 0.
- `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1.
- `adv` must remain greater than 0.

Given that `j` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `adv` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 1.**
