The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. The loop is controlled by the range of `_`, which is determined by the value of `int(input())`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the current value of `_`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented to 1, and the input value must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, and `_` is 1. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
