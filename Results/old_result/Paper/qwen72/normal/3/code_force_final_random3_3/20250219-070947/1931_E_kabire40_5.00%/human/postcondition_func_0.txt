The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an integer `m`. For each test case, it reads a list of `n` integers, reverses each integer, and constructs a string `rev_res` based on specific conditions. If the reversed integer has the same length as the original integer, it is directly appended to `rev_res`. If the reversed integer has a different length, it is stored in a list `rev_val`. After processing all integers, `rev_val` is sorted, and its elements are appended to `rev_res` in an alternating manner: even-indexed elements are appended as is, and odd-indexed elements are appended in their reversed form. Finally, the function compares the integer value of `rev_res` with `10^m` and prints 'Sasha' if `rev_res` is greater, otherwise prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value.
