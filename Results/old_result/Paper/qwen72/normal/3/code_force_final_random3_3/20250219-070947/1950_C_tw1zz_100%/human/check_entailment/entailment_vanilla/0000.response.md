### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours `h` and minutes `m` using the `split(':')` method.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hours to 12-hour format hours.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it correctly sets the hour to the same value and the time period to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, it correctly sets the hour to `12` and the time period to `PM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it correctly converts the hour to the corresponding 12-hour format hour and sets the time period to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, it correctly sets the hour to `12` and the time period to `AM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the converted hour and minute in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using the `print` function with `sep=''` to avoid extra spaces.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM`.
     - `12:00` is converted to `12:00 PM`.
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - While the use of multiple `if-elif` statements is not the most efficient way to handle the conversion, it is functionally correct and covers all possible inputs as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
