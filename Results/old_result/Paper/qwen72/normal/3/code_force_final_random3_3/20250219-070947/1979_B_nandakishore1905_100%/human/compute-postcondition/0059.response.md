Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\), `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2 or is odd, no additional changes are made. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of the largest power of 2 less than `k` that is also even, without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\). If `k` is even and a power of 2, `f` is `k`, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `f`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**
