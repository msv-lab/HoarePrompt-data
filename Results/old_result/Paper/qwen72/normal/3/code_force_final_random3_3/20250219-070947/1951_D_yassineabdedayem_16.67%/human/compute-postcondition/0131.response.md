Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `_`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- `Min` is updated to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is updated to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- The conditions that `k` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` are still valid.
