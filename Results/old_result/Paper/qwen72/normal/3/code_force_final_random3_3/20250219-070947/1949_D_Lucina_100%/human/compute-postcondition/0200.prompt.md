Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is `n + 1`, and `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0. The values of `a`, `b`, `sb`, and `t` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n`. Each character in `nx` is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[i]` at index `j - 1`. If the character is not '?', it is appended directly to `nx`. If the character is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop. For each index `j - 1` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not a question mark (`?`), the character at that position in `nx` is the same as the character at index `j - 1` of the element at index 2 of `xx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is a question mark (`?`), and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, the character at that position in `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, the character at that position in `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop: if `xx[3][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', the character is `xx[3][j - 1]`; if `xx[3][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, the character is 'F'; otherwise, the character is 'S'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
