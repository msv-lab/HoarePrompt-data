#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: `n` (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), `trump_suit` (a character from "CDHS"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS").

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a set of card pairs based on a specified trump suit. It takes no parameters and reads inputs from the user. The first input is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the second input is a trump suit `trump` (a character from "CDHS"), and the third input is a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing cards, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS". The function pairs non-trump cards of the same suit and pairs remaining non-trump cards with trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-trump cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns. Otherwise, it prints all the card pairs, with trump pairs printed first in descending order of rank, followed by the non-trump pairs. The function does not return any value.
