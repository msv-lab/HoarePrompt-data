You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, all within the range [1, 100]. It then calculates the number of groups of three identical integers that can be formed from the list and prints this number for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes `w` being 0, `_` being `w-1` (which is -1), `ln` being the last input integer, `palka` being the last list of integers input by the user, `pl` being a list of all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` being a dictionary with counts of each integer in `palka`, and `shapes` being the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Shape Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length, it checks if the count of that length is at least 3.
   - If the count is at least 3, it calculates the number of polygons that can be formed using that length by integer division `d[j] // 3`.
   - It adds this number to the `shapes` counter.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of polygons that can be formed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Shape Calculation**:
  - The program assumes that a polygon can be formed with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. However, the problem specifically asks for regular (equal-sided) polygons.
  - Regular polygons can have any number of sides, but the program only considers polygons with 3 sides (triangles). This is incorrect because it should consider polygons with any number of sides where the number of sticks of the same length is at least the number of sides.

### Correct Approach:
- For each unique stick length, the program should check if the count of that length is at least `k` (where `k` is the number of sides of a regular polygon).
- The maximum number of polygons that can be formed with a given length is `d[j] // k` for each possible `k` from 3 to `d[j]`.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it only considers triangles and not other regular polygons.

### Correctness: **False**
