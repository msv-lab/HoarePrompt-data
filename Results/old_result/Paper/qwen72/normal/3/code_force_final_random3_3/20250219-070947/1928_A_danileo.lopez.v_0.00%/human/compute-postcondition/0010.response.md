The code snippet provided is simply a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes the conditions and variables before the code is executed, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output will be the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **Yes**
