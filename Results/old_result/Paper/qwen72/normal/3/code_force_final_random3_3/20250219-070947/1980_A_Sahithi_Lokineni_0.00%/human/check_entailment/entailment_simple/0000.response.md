Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the given string and then calculating the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Default Value for `defaultdict`:**
   - The program uses `defaultdict(default_value)`, but `default_value` is not defined anywhere. This will cause a `NameError` when the program runs. The correct way to initialize a `defaultdict` with a default value of 0 is `defaultdict(int)`.

2. **Logic for Counting Additional Problems:**
   - The logic to count the additional problems needed is incorrect. The program should check if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and, if so, add the difference to the total number of additional problems needed. However, the current logic is:
     ```python
     if d[val] <= m:
         ans = ans + m - d[val]
     ```
     This means that if the count of a difficulty level is exactly `m`, the program will still add 0 to `ans`. This is correct, but if the count is less than `m`, the program will add the difference to `ans`. This part is correct, but it should be `if d[val] < m` instead of `if d[val] <= m`.

3. **Handling All Difficulty Levels:**
   - The program only iterates over the keys in the `defaultdict`. However, if a difficulty level (e.g., 'A') is not present in the input string, it will not be in the `defaultdict` and the program will not account for it. To handle this, the program should iterate over all possible difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') and check their counts.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:**
  - `d = defaultdict(int)` initializes a `defaultdict` with a default value of 0 for any key that is not present.
- **Counting Occurrences:**
  - The loop `for i in range(n): d[s[i]] += 1` counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string.
- **Calculating Additional Problems:**
  - The loop `for val in 'ABCDEFG':` iterates over all possible difficulty levels.
  - `if d[val] < m: ans += m - d[val]` checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and adds the difference to `ans`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues and the corrected program, the original program is incorrect due to the `default_value` issue and the logic for handling all difficulty levels.

Correctness: **False**
