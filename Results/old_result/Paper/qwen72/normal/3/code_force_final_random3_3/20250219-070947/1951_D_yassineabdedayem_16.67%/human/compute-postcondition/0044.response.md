The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in `tab` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `tab`, and `tab` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `tab`, and `tab` must have at least two elements.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations, `k` is currently 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `tab`**
