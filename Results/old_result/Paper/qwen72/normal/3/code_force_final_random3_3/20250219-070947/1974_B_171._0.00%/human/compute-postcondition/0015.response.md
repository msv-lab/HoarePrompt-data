The only variables in the loop head are `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means `c` starts at 97 and increases by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 98. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented to 99.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with the entry `{'a': char, 'b': char}` if `chr(c)` ('b') was not in `mapping.values()` and was added, otherwise `mapping` remains an empty dictionary. `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` except for the entries `{'a': char}` and `{'b': char}` if they were added, and `c` is 99.**
