The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 1, `j` is 1, `count2` is 1 (if `s[j]` is equal to `x`). If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False. The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
