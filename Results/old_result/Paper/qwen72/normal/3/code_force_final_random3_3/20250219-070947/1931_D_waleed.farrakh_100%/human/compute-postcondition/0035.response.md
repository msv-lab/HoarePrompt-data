The value of `count` is appended to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `arr` has `n` elements, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, and `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that have been encountered more than once during the loop execution.**
