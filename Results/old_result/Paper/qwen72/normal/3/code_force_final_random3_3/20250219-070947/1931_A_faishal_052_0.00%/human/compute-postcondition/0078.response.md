Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2. If `lex` <= 26, `lex` is reduced by 1 and `arr` contains the elements [1, 1]. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 52. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 26.***
