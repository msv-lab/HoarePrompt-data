### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` applications with 1x1 icons and `y` applications with 2x2 icons.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. As noted in the original assessment, it is not used in the main logic and can be ignored for correctness.
   - **`func_2()`**: This function handles the logic for a single test case.
     - It reads `x` and `y` from the input.
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`) using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - It then adjusts the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) by subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons.
       - It calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`).
       - It prints the total number of screens required.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - It prints the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - It prints the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - It prints 0.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - **2x2 Icons**:
     - Each screen can hold a maximum of 2 2x2 icons (since 2x2 = 4 cells and 15 / 4 = 3.75, which means 3 icons if we consider only full icons, but we can fit 2 icons and 7 1x1 icons).
     - The formula `math.ceil(y / 2)` correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - **1x1 Icons**:
     - After placing 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on each screen are `15 - 4 * 2 = 7` cells.
     - The formula `x = x - bxsfory * (15 - 4 * 2)` should be used to adjust the number of 1x1 icons.
     - The formula `math.ceil(x / 15)` should be used to calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

4. **Annotated Code Review**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state and behavior of the program.
   - However, the original logic in `func_2()` for adjusting the number of 1x1 icons and calculating the additional screens needed for them is indeed incorrect.

5. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The correct formula for adjusting the number of 1x1 icons should be:
     ```python
     x = x - bxsfory * (15 - 4 * 2)
     ```
   - The correct formula for calculating the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons should be:
     ```python
     bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
     ```

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified the logical errors in the program.
   - The provided program does not correctly calculate the remaining 1x1 icons and the additional screens needed for them.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
