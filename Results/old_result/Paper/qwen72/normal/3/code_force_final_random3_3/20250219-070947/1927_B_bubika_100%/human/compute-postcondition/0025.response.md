To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is a non-empty list. Given the initial state, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, but we need to ensure it has at least one element for the loop to execute.

- `i` will take the value of the first element in `s` at the start of the first iteration.
- `s` must have at least one element for the loop to start.

The other variables (`t`, `b`, `n`, and `r`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the first element in `s`**
