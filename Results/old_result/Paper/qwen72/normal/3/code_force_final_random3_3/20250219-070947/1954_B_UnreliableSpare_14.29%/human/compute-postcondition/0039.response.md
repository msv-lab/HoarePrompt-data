Postcondition: ***`n` is the same as the input, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of times the first element `val` appears consecutively from the start of the array, and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` value and `cnt`. If all elements in `arr` are the same, `flag` is `True`. Otherwise, `flag` is `False`.***
