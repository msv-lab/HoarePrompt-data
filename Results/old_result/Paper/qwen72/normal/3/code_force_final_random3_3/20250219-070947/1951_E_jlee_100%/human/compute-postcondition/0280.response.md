Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True and `count2` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0, `done` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
