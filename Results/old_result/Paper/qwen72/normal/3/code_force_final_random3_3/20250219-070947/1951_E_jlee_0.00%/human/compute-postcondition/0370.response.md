To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
   - `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `count` is less than 1.
   - `count2` remains 0.
   - `done` is False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 1, `count2` remains 0, and `done` is False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `s[j]` equals `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, and `done` is False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string 'YES'.
   - The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the print statement directly. The print statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is:

Output: **YES**
