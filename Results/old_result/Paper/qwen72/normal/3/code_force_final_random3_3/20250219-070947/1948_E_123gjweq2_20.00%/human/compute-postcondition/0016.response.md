The code snippet `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` updates the value of the `cliquess` list at the index `left + mid + i` to be `clique`. 

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0).
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 0).
- `i` is 0.
- `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`.
- `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - i`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`.

After executing the code:
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is now `clique`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 0), `i` is 0, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `clique`.**
