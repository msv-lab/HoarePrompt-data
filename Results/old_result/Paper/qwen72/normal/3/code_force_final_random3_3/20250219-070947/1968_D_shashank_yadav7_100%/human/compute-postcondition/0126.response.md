Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the input integer - 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * (input integer - 1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * (input integer - 1) + sp`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bm`, `sm`, and `bp` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
