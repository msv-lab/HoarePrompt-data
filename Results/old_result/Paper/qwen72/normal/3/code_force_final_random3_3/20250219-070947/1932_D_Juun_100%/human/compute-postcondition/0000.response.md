Output State: **The function should take three parameters: `n` (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), `trump_suit` (a character from "CDHS"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS"). The `input()` function has been called, but since it does not assign its result to any variable, no variables are updated.**

The initial state remains unchanged, and the `input()` function call does not affect any of the variables or the conditions specified in the initial state.
