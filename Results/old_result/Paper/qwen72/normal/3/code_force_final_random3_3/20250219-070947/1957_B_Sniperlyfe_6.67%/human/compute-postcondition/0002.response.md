Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest of the elements still initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the first element of the list `nums` (at index `i`, which is 0) to the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The value of `k` is not specified, so the exact value of the first element of `nums` depends on the value of `k`. The length of `nums` remains `n`, and all other elements in the list are still initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
