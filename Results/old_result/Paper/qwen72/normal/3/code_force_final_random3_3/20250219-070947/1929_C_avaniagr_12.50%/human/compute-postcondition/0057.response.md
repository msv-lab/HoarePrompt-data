The `print` statement in the given code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `_`, `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **YES**
