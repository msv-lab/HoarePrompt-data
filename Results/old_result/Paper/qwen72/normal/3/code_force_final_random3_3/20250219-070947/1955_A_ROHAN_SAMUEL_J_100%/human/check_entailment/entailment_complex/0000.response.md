Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the prices `a` for one yogurt and `b` for two yogurts. The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Odd and Even Cases**:
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, then the cheapest way to buy `n` yogurts is to buy all of them at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - If `2 * a >= b`, then the cheapest way is to buy as many pairs of yogurts at the promotion price as possible and then buy one additional yogurt at the regular price (`n // 2 * b + a`).
   - If `n` is even, the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, then the cheapest way to buy `n` yogurts is to buy all of them at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - If `2 * a >= b`, then the cheapest way is to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

3. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - The program prints `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - The program prints `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program prints `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program prints `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`, which is correct.

The program correctly handles both odd and even cases and prints the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
