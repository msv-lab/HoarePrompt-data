Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is `cases - 1`, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is the last input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from input, `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0 that are less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

### Explanation:
- **`c`**: After all iterations, `c` will be equal to `cases - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `cases - 1`.
- **`na_frente`**: This variable is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the inner loop, and it will end up being `-1` after the inner loop completes.
- **`pos_final`**: This variable is set to the input integer minus 1 for each test case, and after the last test case, it will be the last input integer minus 1.
- **`custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`**: These lists are read from input for each test case and remain as the last input lists after the loop completes.
- **`total`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0.
- **`best`**: This variable tracks the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0 that are less than or equal to `pos_final`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
