Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Structure**: The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. The function `func_1()` itself reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of cards. This structure is consistent with the problem description and handles the input correctly.

2. **Card Processing**:
   - The program initializes a list `trumps` to store the ranks of trump cards and a dictionary `suits` to store the ranks of non-trump cards by their suits.
   - For each card in the input list, it checks if the card is a trump card. If it is, the rank is added to the `trumps` list. If it is not, the program checks if there is already a card of the same suit in `suits`. If there is, it forms a pair of cards with the current card and the stored card, sorts the ranks, and appends the pair to the `answers` list. The suit entry in `suits` is then set to `None` to indicate that the suit has been paired.
   - If there is no card of the same suit in `suits`, the current card's rank is stored in `suits` under the corresponding suit.

3. **Forming Pairs**:
   - After processing all cards, the program checks if there are any remaining suits in `suits` that have not been paired. If there are, it attempts to pair these cards with trump cards from the `trumps` list.
   - If there are no trump cards left to pair with the remaining non-trump cards, the program prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns, indicating that it is not possible to form the required pairs.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints pairs of trump cards, sorted by rank, if there are any left in the `trumps` list.
   - It then prints the pairs of non-trump cards stored in the `answers` list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no trump cards available to pair with non-trump cards.
   - It also handles the case where all cards can be paired without issues.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program follows the rules of the game as described: non-trump cards are paired with higher-ranked cards of the same suit, and trump cards can beat any non-trump card.
   - The program ensures that all pairs are valid and that the trump cards are used to beat non-trump cards when necessary.
   - The program correctly prints "IMPOSSIBLE" if it is not possible to form the required pairs.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
