Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid. Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **`func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values. It is not directly used in the main logic of the program, so it is not necessary for the correctness of the solution.

2. **`func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`) from the input.
   - It calculates the minimum number of screens required based on the following logic:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 5x3 grid can fit 2 such icons (8 cells) plus 7 cells for 1x1 icons. Therefore, `y / 2` gives the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
       - `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This step accounts for the cells occupied by the 2x2 icons and the remaining cells available for 1x1 icons. The `bxsfory * 15` term subtracts the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons, and `y * 4` adds back the cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
       - `bxsfory1` is calculated as 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise as the ceiling of the updated `x / 15` plus 1. This ensures that any remaining 1x1 icons are placed on additional screens if needed.
       - The function prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`, which gives the total number of screens required.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - The function prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - The function prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - The function prints 0, as no screens are needed.

3. **`func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_2` `t` times, which processes each test case individually.

The logic in `func_2` appears to correctly handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens. The function `func_3` correctly iterates over the test cases and calls `func_2` for each one.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program seems to meet the requirements and handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
