Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is accurate and correctly returns the GCD.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2(n, m)` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the logic used in this function does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` is not derived from the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, but it does not correctly check the condition for all possible pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Specific Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Calculation of `x` and `y`**:
     - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` is not related to the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be an arbitrary formula that does not reflect the problem's constraints.
   - **Edge Case Handling**:
     - The program does not handle the edge case where \(a\) and \(b\) are both 1 correctly. The correct output for the pair (1, 1) should be 1, but the program's logic might not produce this result consistently.
   - **General Logic Error**:
     - The program does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). The program should output 4, but it does not. Instead, it outputs 3, which is incorrect.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem statement. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not align with the problem's constraints.

Final: **False**
