Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times, `i` is `n`, `a` is now a list of integers where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original `a` list up to that index, `b` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `1 <= j <= n`, `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `1` if the original `a[j]` (before the update) is greater than 1, otherwise `b[j]` is the sum of `b[j-1]` and `2`.**
