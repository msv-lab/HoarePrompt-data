Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being `>`, `k` is 2. If the character at the 0th index of `b` is not `>`, `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.***
