Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`. The function then evaluates and prints a result based on the following conditions for each test case:
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a`.
- If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints the result of the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
- Otherwise, it prints the result of the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.

After executing `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed for each case. **
