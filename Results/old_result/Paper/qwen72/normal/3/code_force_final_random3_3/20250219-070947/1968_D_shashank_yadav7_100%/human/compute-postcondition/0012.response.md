Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k - 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k - 1)`**

Explanation:
- `k` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `k - 1`.
- The value of `bm` is recalculated as `a[b] * (k - 1)`.
- The value of `sm` is recalculated as `a[s] * (k - 1)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
