Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `n` is even.
- `a` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
- `b` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
- `_` is 0.
- The current value of `2 * a` is less than `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(a * n)` statement will print the product of `a` and `n`.
- `a` is an integer between 1 and 30.
- `n` is an even integer between 1 and 100.
- The condition `2 * a < b` is given, but it does not affect the value of `a * n` directly. It only provides a constraint on the values of `a` and `b`.

### Output:
The code will print the product of `a` and `n`, where `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `n` is an even integer between 1 and 100.

Output: **a * n (where a is an integer between 1 and 30, and n is an even integer between 1 and 100)**
