### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `N` and the list `a` of `N` integers.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the list `a`. This is a correct approach to keep track of how many times each integer appears in the array.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The game's goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been removed. Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will always try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The program iterates through the range from `0` to `N` and checks the count of each integer `i` in the `defaultdict` `cnt`.
   - If `cnt[i]` is `1`, it means that `i` appears exactly once in `a`. Alice can pick this element, and Bob will pick it in the next turn, effectively removing it from the game.
   - The variable `t` is used to count how many unique elements with a count of `1` have been found.
   - If `t` is greater than or equal to `2` or `cnt[i]` is `0`, the program returns `i`. This is because:
     - If `t` is `2`, it means both Alice and Bob have picked elements that are unique, and the next smallest integer `i` that is not in `a` will be the MEX.
     - If `cnt[i]` is `0`, it means `i` is the smallest integer that is not in `a`, and thus it is the MEX.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same, which is a valid input scenario.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program efficiently counts the elements and iterates through the range from `0` to `N` to determine the MEX, ensuring that it can handle the constraints of the problem (up to 2 * 10^5 elements and up to 2 * 10^4 test cases).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The reasoning and the steps taken in the program are sound and align with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
