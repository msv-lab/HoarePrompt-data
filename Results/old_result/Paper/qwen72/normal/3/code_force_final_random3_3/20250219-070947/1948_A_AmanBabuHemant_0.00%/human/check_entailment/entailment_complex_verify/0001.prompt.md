You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO". Otherwise, it should return a string "YES" followed by a string of length at most 200 that satisfies the condition.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `n`, and `s` remains undefined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`. The length of `s` remains less than 200 if it was initially less than 200, or greater than or equal to 200 if it was initially greater than or equal to 200.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and checks if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` consisting of the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `t` and `n` are no longer in scope.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly `n` characters are special.
   - A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string should have a length of at most 200.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is part of a pair (each character must have exactly one neighbor that is the same).
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`.
   - If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Evaluating the Pattern:**
   - The pattern '110' is used to create special characters. In this pattern, the first two '1's are special because each '1' is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The '0' in the pattern is not special because it is not equal to either of its neighbors.
   - Therefore, for each '110' segment, there are 2 special characters.
   - Repeating '110' `n // 2` times will create exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Checking the Length Constraint:**
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`.
   - For `n` up to 50, the maximum length of `s` is `3 * (50 // 2) = 3 * 25 = 75`, which is well within the 200-character limit.
   - Therefore, the length check `if len(s) < 200` is always true for valid inputs (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program correctly prints 'NO' for odd `n` and 'YES' followed by the string for even `n`.
   - The string `s` is always valid and within the length limit for the given range of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description and input constraints.
