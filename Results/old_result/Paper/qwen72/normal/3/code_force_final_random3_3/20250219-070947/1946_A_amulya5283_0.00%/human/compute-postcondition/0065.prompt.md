Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is updated to `arr[median_index]` (the new median after sorting), `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, and `heap` is now a min-heap, `operations` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while heap[0] <= current_median:
    smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
    heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap[0]` is no longer the smallest element in the heap, `smallest` is now equal to `current_median`, and `heap` has the same number of elements as before. The smallest element in `heap` is now `smallest + 1`, which is `arr[median_index] + 1`. `operations` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `heap[0]` is now the smallest element in the heap, `smallest` is equal to `arr[median_index] + 1`, `heap` has the same number of elements as before the execution of the code, and `operations` is increased by 2. The new smallest element in the heap is `smallest + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `heap[0]` is now the next smallest element in the heap, `smallest` is equal to the previous `heap[0]`, `heap` has the same number of elements as before the execution of the code, `operations` is increased by 3, and `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `arr[median_index] + 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
