Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_beauty` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[1]` and `new_arr[0]`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `left`, `right`, `new_arr`) retain their initial values and conditions.
