The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from `l`, `m` is the length of `l`. If `1` is in `l`, the list `l` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in `l`.**
