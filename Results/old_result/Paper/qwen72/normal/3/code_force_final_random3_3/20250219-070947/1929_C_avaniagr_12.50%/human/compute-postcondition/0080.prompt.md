You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `cases` where `t` is the number of test cases and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is `t - 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each iteration are provided by the user. For each iteration, the conditions checked within the loop remain the same: if `x` is less than `k - 1`, `a` is checked against `x + 1`; if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, `a` is checked against `x + 3`; if `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is calculated based on the loop, and `a` is checked against `z`. The final output state will reflect the results of these checks for all `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple contains three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
