Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` that maximizes `max_sum` or `1` if no such `y` exists, and `y` is 0.**
