Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `x-1`, and `x` must be greater than or equal to `x-1`. If `x` < `y`, no changes are made to `x`, `y`, or `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x`, `y`, or `i`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x-1`, which is the last value it reaches in the loop. The values of `x` and `y` will remain unchanged from their last input values, and the loop will have executed `x` times. The condition `x` < `y` or `x` â‰¥ `y` will have been checked for each iteration, but it does not affect the final values of `x` and `y`.
