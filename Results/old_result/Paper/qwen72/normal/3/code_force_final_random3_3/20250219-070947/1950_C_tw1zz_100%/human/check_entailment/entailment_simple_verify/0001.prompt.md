You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", and the loop has printed the time in 12-hour format for each input string `s` provided by the user. For each input string, `h` is the hour part, `m` is the minute part, `h1` is the hour part converted to 12-hour format, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part. The loop counter `_` has been incremented for each iteration, and the loop has executed `t` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours `h` and minutes `m` using the `split(':')` method.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hours to 12-hour format hours.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it correctly sets the hour to the same value and the time period to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, it correctly sets the hour to `12` and the time period to `PM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it correctly converts the hour to the corresponding 12-hour format hour and sets the time period to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, it correctly sets the hour to `12` and the time period to `AM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the converted hour and minute in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using the `print` function with `sep=''` to avoid extra spaces.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM`.
     - `12:00` is converted to `12:00 PM`.
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - While the use of multiple `if-elif` statements is not the most efficient way to handle the conversion, it is functionally correct and covers all possible inputs as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
