#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the function should be called with specific inputs that are not directly passed as arguments. The inputs are expected to be provided in a predefined format: the first line contains two integers n and t, where n represents the number of nodes in the tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) and t is always 1. The next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree. The last line contains a single integer u (1 ≤ u ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `nodes` represents a node and its value is a list containing all the nodes it is connected to. `edges` remains an empty list, and `empty` remains True.
    ends = []
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            ends.append(key)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, and `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1.
    s, e = list(ends)
    tree = [s]
    prev = s
    curr = nodes[s][0]
    while curr != e:
        tree.append(curr)
        
        if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][1]
        else:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][0]
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the `tree` list now contains a sequence of nodes starting from the first element of `ends` (`s`) and ending at the second element of `ends` (`e`). The `prev` variable is set to the last node added to `tree` before the loop terminated, and `curr` is set to `e`. The values of `n`, `i`, `nodes`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged, and `ends` still contains all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1.
    tree.append(e)
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [idx, n - idx - 1]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *The loop has completed all iterations, and the `tree` list now contains a sequence of nodes starting from the first element of `ends` (`s`) and ending at the second element of `ends` (`e`). The `prev` variable is set to the last node added to `tree` before the loop terminated, and `curr` is set to `e`. The values of `n`, `i`, `nodes`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged, and `ends` still contains all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1. `start` is assigned the value of an input integer. `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list. `moves` is a list containing two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even, and the program follows the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input to construct a tree with `n` nodes and processes it to determine the winner of a game between two players, Ron and Hermione. The tree is represented by a list of edges, and the function identifies a path between two leaf nodes. It then takes a starting node as input and calculates the number of moves required to reach the leaf nodes from the starting node. If the number of moves to either leaf node is odd, the function prints 'Ron'. If both numbers of moves are even, the function prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
