Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string. If `n` == 2, the conditions for the if part are met: if `s` == '00', no additional changes are made. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the conditions for the if part are met. If `s` contains exactly one '11' and `count_1` is 2, the conditions for the if part are also met. Otherwise, the conditions for the else part are met.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decreased by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`.
- The values of `start`, `end`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for the if and else parts remain the same as described in the initial state.
