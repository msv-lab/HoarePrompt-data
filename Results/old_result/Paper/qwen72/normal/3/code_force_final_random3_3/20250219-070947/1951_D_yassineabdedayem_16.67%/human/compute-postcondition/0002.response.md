Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is a dummy variable starting from 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `_` is a dummy variable starting from 0.
- The code snippet reads a line from the standard input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`.
- The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
- The output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` as integers read from the input, while `t` and `_` retain their initial values.
