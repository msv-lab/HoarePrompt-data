To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

1. **`results` must be a non-empty list**: For the loop to execute at least once, `results` must contain at least one element.
2. **`result` will be the first element in `results`**: Before the loop starts, `result` should be the first element in `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx:idx + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`
- `idx` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended `t` times

We need to ensure that `results` is non-empty. Since `results` is initially empty (as `t` is 0 and `func_1(n, a)` has not been called yet), we need to adjust the state to ensure `results` has at least one element.

**Adjusted State:**
- `results` must have at least one element.
- `result` is the first element in `results`.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` must have at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
