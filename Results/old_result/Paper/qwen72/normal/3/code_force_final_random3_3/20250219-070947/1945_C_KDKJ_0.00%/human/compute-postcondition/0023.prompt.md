Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user, `S` is a list containing a single sublist `[0, 0]`.
Code of the loop:
for s in a:
    x, y = S[-1]
    if s == '0':
        x += 1
    else:
        y += 1
    S.append([x, y])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least one character, `s` is the first character of `a`. If `s` is '0', `x` is 1 and `y` is 0. If `s` is '1', `x` is 0 and `y` is 1. In both cases, `S` is a list containing two sublists: `[0, 0]` and `[x, y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least two characters, `s` is the second character of `a`. If `s` is '0', `x` is 2 and `y` is 0. If `s` is '1', `x` is 0 and `y` is 2. `S` is a list containing three sublists: `[0, 0]`, `[x, y]`, and `[x, y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least three characters, `s` is the third character of `a`. If `s` is '0', then `x` is 3 and `y` is 0, and `S` is a list containing four sublists: `[0, 0]`, `[3, 0]`, `[3, 0]`, and `[3, 0]`. If `s` is '1', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 3, and `S` is a list containing four sublists: `[0, 0]`, `[0, 3]`, `[0, 3]`, and `[0, 3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
