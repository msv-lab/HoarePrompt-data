Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers.
2. `ops` is a list containing all the tuples it originally had.
3. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`.
4. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`vx` and `ops`**:
   - `vx` is a set with exactly 2 integers. Let's denote these integers as `a` and `b`.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `ops` is of the form `(v1, v2)`.

2. **`p1`**:
   - `p1` is a list that starts with the two integers from `vx`, i.e., `p1 = [a, b]`.
   - Then, for each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops`, if `p1[-1]` (the last element of `p1`) is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

3. **`p2`**:
   - `p2` is a list that contains all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` (the last element of `p1`) is equal to `v2`.

4. **`p1[::-1] + p2`**:
   - `p1[::-1]` reverses the list `p1`.
   - `p1[::-1] + p2` concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`.

5. **`' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**:
   - `map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)` converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.
   - `' '.join(...)` joins these string elements with a space.

6. **`print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)`**:
   - The `print` statement will print a string that starts with `!` followed by the space-separated elements of the concatenated list `p1[::-1] + p2`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `vx = {1, 2}`
- `ops = [(3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3)]`

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Initial `p1` and `p2`**:
   - `p1 = [1, 2]`
   - `p2 = []`

2. **Processing `ops`**:
   - For `(3, 1)`: `p1[-1]` is `2` and `v2` is `1`. Since `2 != 1`, append `3` to `p1`.
     - `p1 = [1, 2, 3]`
   - For `(4, 2)`: `p1[-1]` is `3` and `v2` is `2`. Since `3 != 2`, append `4` to `p1`.
     - `p1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - For `(5, 3)`: `p1[-1]` is `4` and `v2` is `3`. Since `4 != 3`, append `5` to `p1`.
     - `p1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

3. **Final `p1` and `p2`**:
   - `p1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - `p2 = []`

4. **Reversing `p1`**:
   - `p1[::-1] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

5. **Concatenating `p1[::-1]` and `p2`**:
   - `p1[::-1] + p2 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

6. **Joining and Printing**:
   - `' '.join(map(str, [5, 4, 3, 2, 1])) = '5 4 3 2 1'`
   - The `print` statement will output: `! 5 4 3 2 1`

### Final Output:
Output: **! 5 4 3 2 1 (where the elements are the reversed elements of `p1` followed by the elements of `p2`, and `p1` and `p2` are constructed based on the given conditions)**

Note: The exact values of `p1` and `p2` depend on the specific values in `vx` and `ops`, but the format and structure of the output will always follow the described pattern.
