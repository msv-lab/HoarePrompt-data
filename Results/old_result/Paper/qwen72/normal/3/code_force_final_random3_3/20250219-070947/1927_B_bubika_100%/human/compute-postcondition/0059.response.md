The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of a list `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided constraints and relationships.**
