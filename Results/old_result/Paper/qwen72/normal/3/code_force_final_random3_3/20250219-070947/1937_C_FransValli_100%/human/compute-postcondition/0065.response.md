The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if the result of `int(input())` is greater than `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution, and `mini` is the last element in the list `arr` for which the input `res` was not '>', or it remains the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` is 1.
- The result of `int(input())` must still be greater than `_` for the loop to continue. Since `int(input())` is greater than 0, it must now be greater than 1.

State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution, `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=', `mini` is the last element in the list `arr` for which the input `res` was not '>', or it remains the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**
