Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `arr`. It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. After the function concludes, all elements in the `results` iterable have been printed, and the state of the program includes the number of test cases `t` being greater than 0, `test_cases` being a list of `t` tuples, and `results` being an iterable with at least `t` elements. **
