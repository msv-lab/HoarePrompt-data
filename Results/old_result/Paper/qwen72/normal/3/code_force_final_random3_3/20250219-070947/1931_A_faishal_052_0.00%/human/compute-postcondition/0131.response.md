Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `cases` is greater than 2 (this is not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 2.
- `lex` is an input integer.
- `arr` is defined based on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 27]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `arr[k]` based on the value of `lex`:**
   - Since `k` is 2, we need to look at the third element of the list `arr`.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, so `arr[k]` is `lex`.
   - If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`, so `arr[k]` is `lex`.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 27]`, so `arr[k]` is `lex - 27`.

2. **Convert `arr[k]` to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`:**
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding character in the ASCII table.
   - Adding 96 to the integer value of `arr[k]` will shift the value to the range of lowercase letters (97 to 122, which correspond to 'a' to 'z').

3. **Output based on the value of `lex`:**
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr[k]` is `lex`, and `chr(lex + 96)` will convert `lex` to the corresponding lowercase letter.
   - If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr[k]` is `lex`, and `chr(lex + 96)` will convert `lex` to the corresponding lowercase letter.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr[k]` is `lex - 27`, and `chr((lex - 27) + 96)` will convert `lex - 27` to the corresponding lowercase letter.

### Final Output:
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, the output will be the lowercase letter corresponding to `lex`.
- If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, the output will be the lowercase letter corresponding to `lex`.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, the output will be the lowercase letter corresponding to `lex - 27`.

Output: **the lowercase letter corresponding to `lex` if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, or the lowercase letter corresponding to `lex` if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, or the lowercase letter corresponding to `lex - 27` if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52**.
