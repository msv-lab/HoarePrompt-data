The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`. The loop can execute again if there is another element in `tab` to be assigned to `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `tab`, and `tab` contains at least one string representation of a `number` value. For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of a `number` value, `i` is the second element of `tab`, and `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop**
