Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` is the index where `D[index]` is the first value greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index just before the first value in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, and all other values (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` is updated based on the condition: if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `l` remains the index where `D[index]` is the first value greater than `left - f`. `h` is updated based on the condition: if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `h` remains the index just before the first value in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f` and `h` must be greater than `l`; otherwise, `h` is set to `l + (h - l) // 2`. `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. `mid` is the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and all other values (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `f` is the next element in `F`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `h` remains the index just before the first value in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f`, with `h` being greater than `l`. Otherwise, `l` remains the same and `h` is updated to `mid`. All other values (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged. `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `h` remains the index just before the first value in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f`, with `h` being greater than `l`. Otherwise, `l` remains the same and `h` is updated to `mid`. All other values (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged. `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to execute one more time.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
