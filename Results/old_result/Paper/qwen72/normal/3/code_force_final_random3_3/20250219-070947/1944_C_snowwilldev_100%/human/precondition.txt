The function `solve` is called within a context where multiple test cases are provided. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and an array a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
