The only variable in the loop head is `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which corresponds to the ASCII values of characters from 'a' to 'z'. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 97, which is the ASCII value of 'a'. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 98, which is the ASCII value of 'b'. The state of the `mapping` dictionary is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`c` is 98, `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged**
