Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` contains the element 1, `k` is 2, and `lex` is reduced by 1. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `lex` is now `lex - 1`. If `lex` was between 26 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is now `lex - 27`.**
