You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are values of any type that can be compared using the less than (<) operator.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are values of any type that can be compared using the less than (<) operator. It returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the returned value is the minimum of the two input values.

            #State: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and x, y are now assigned new values from user input. If x > 0 and y == 0, then the current value of x is greater than 0, and the current value of y is 0. Otherwise, it is not the case that (x > 0 and y == 0), and either x is 0 or y is 0, with the condition that it is not the case that (x == 0 and y > 0).
        #State: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and x, y are now assigned new values from user input. If x == 0 and y > 0, the current value of x is 0, and the current value of y is greater than 0. If x > 0 and y == 0, the current value of x is greater than 0, and the current value of y is 0. Otherwise, either x is 0 or y is 0, but it is not the case that (x == 0 and y > 0).
    #State: *x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. If x > 0 and y > 0, `x` is updated to `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, and `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is 0. If x == 0 and y > 0, the current value of x is 0, and the current value of y is greater than 0. If x > 0 and y == 0, the current value of x is greater than 0, and the current value of y is 0. If x == 0 and y == 0, both x and y remain 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, from user input, where both `x` and `y` are in the range 0 to 99. The function then prints a value based on the following conditions:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, updates `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, and calculates `bxsfory1` as 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise as the ceiling of the updated `x / 15` plus 1. It then prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and `func_2()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then calls the function `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `func_2` has been called `t` times, and the program state reflects that the loop has completed `t` iterations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` applications with 1x1 icons and `y` applications with 2x2 icons.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. It is not used in the main logic and can be ignored for correctness.
   - **`func_2()`**: This function handles the logic for a single test case.
     - It reads `x` and `y` from the input.
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`) using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - It then adjusts the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) by subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons.
       - It calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`).
       - It prints the total number of screens required.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - It prints the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - It prints the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - It prints 0.
   - **`func_3()`**: This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_2()` for each test case.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - For 2x2 icons, each screen can hold a maximum of 2 such icons (since 2x2 = 4 cells and 15 / 4 = 3.75, which means 3 icons if we consider only full icons, but we can fit 2 icons and 7 1x1 icons).
   - For 1x1 icons, each screen can hold a maximum of 15 such icons.
   - The logic in `func_2()` correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - The logic for adjusting the number of 1x1 icons is incorrect. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is not correct. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * (15 - 4 * 2)` to account for the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The logic for calculating the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is also incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` instead of `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.

4. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The correct formula for adjusting the number of 1x1 icons should be:
     ```python
     x = x - bxsfory * (15 - 4 * 2)
     ```
   - The correct formula for calculating the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons should be:
     ```python
     bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
     ```

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program has logical errors in the way it calculates the remaining 1x1 icons and the additional screens needed for them.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
