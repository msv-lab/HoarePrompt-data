The function `func_1` reads input to construct a tree with `n` nodes and processes it to determine the winner of a game between two players, Ron and Hermione. The tree is represented by a list of edges, and the function identifies a path between two leaf nodes. It then takes a starting node as input and calculates the number of moves required to reach the leaf nodes from the starting node. If the number of moves to either leaf node is odd, the function prints 'Ron'. If both numbers of moves are even, the function prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
