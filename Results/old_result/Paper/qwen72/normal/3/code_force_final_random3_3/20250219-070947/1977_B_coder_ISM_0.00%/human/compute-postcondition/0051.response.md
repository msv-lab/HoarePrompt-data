Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from position 0 to 29), and `s[2]` is now '-1'. If `flag` is true and `s[2]` was '0' before the code execution, then `s[2]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, `i`, `s`, and `flag` remain unchanged.**
