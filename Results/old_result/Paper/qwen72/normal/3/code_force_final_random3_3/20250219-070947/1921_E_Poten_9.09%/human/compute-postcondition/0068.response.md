Postcondition: **`answers` is an empty list or contains the string 'Draw' or 'Alice'. `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, and either `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd, or `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even. Additionally, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is greater than the current value of `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between the current value of `clues[3]` and the current value of `clues[5]` is greater than 1. If the current value of `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of the difference between the current values of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the current value of `clues[3]` minus the current value of `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the difference between the current values of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Alice'.**
