Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `k` is greater than 0 or `i` is the next value after `k` becomes 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer - 1, `s` is the input integer - 1, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration. If `k` is 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks. After the if-else block, if `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` holds. If `bm` is less than `sm`, the condition `bm < sm` holds. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the condition `bm == sm` holds.**
