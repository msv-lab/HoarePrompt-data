You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif k % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = k - q
            while f & f - 1 != 0:
                l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
                p = len(l)
                q = 2 ** (p - 1)
                f = f - q
            print(f)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a number of iterations from the user, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `k` is odd, it prints 1. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, it performs a series of operations to reduce `k` to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and prints the result of this reduction. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each iteration. After the function concludes, the input variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and the final state of the program is determined by the last values of `n`, `m`, and `k` processed in the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical issue that can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the difference `k` between `n` and `m` is a power of 2. 

The program checks if `k` is a power of 2 using the condition `if k & k - 1 == 0:`. This is correct. However, the program then prints `k` directly, which is incorrect. The length of the longest common subsegment when `k` is a power of 2 should be `2^p` where `p` is the position of the highest set bit in `k`. For example, if `k = 8` (which is `2^3`), the correct length of the longest common subsegment should be `8`, but the program will print `8` directly, which is correct in this case. However, if `k` is not a power of 2, the program's logic to find the correct length is flawed.

Consider the following example:
- Input: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
- The difference `k = abs(12 - 4) = 8`
- The program will print `8`, which is correct for this case.

However, for another example:
- Input: `x = 10`, `y = 2`
- The difference `k = abs(10 - 2) = 8`
- The program will print `8`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `4`.

The issue lies in the logic for handling cases where `k` is not a power of 2. The program should correctly identify the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and then adjust `k` accordingly to find the correct length of the longest common subsegment. The current logic does not handle this correctly, leading to potential incorrect results.
