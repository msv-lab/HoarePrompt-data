Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, and `i` is 2. If `a[i] == tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the updated `cnt`. If `a[i] != tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the previous `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.***
