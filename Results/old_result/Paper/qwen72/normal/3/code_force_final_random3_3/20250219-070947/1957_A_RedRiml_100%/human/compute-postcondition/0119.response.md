Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `d` remain unchanged.
- The variable `shapes` is updated to be the sum of the integer division of the counts of all unique elements in `palka` by 3, but only for those elements that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. This means that for each unique integer `j` in the list `pl`, if `j` appears 3 or more times in `palka`, `shapes` is incremented by the number of complete sets of 3 that `j` forms. If `j` appears fewer than 3 times, it does not contribute to `shapes`.
