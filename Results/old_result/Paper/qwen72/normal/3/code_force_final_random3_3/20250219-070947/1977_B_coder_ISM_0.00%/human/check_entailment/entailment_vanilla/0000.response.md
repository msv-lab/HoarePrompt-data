### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x` and initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program generates a binary representation of `x` by checking each bit from 0 to 29 (since \(2^{30}\) is the upper limit for `x`).
   - It appends '1' to `s` if the bit is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true) and '0' otherwise.

3. **Adjusting the Binary Representation:**
   - The program then processes the binary representation to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a '1' needs to be adjusted to '-1' and the next '0' to '1'.
   - If a '1' is found and the flag is set, it changes the current '1' to '-1' and sets the flag to 1.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes the current '0' to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is set at the end of the loop and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'.
   - If the flag is still set after the last element, it changes the last element to '0' and appends '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The program makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by checking for the pattern '1 -1' and adjusting it to '0 -1'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the array `s` and the array itself.

### Analysis:

- **Binary Representation Generation:**
  - The binary representation is correctly generated by checking each bit from 0 to 29.
  - This ensures that the array `s` contains only '1', '0', or '-1' and that the sum of the elements in `s` multiplied by their respective powers of 2 equals `x`.

- **Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
  - The program correctly adjusts the binary representation to avoid consecutive non-zero elements.
  - The flag mechanism is used to propagate the adjustment from '1' to '-1' and the next '0' to '1'.
  - The final pass ensures that any remaining '1 -1' patterns are adjusted to '0 -1'.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem by generating a valid array `a` that meets all the given constraints. The logic for adjusting the binary representation to avoid consecutive non-zero elements is sound, and the output format is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
