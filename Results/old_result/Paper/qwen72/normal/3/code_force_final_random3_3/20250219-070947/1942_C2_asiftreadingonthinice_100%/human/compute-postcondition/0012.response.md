Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number but not equal to 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**

The code snippet appends the integer value of half the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `tmp`. Since the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number but not equal to 2, the value appended to `tmp` is a specific integer. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
