You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, where the input is a space-separated string of two integers. If the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative (i.e., (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0), the function proceeds with this condition. Otherwise, the difference between `n` and `m` is either not divisible by 2 or `n - m` is less than 0, and the function handles this alternative condition.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` because:

1. **`n >= m`**: Nikita can only have `m` cubes if he has made at least `m` moves to add those cubes.
2. **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: The difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be even because each move that adds a cube must be balanced by a move that removes a cube to maintain the final count of `m` cubes.

The current condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient because it does not ensure that the number of moves is enough to reach `m` cubes. For example, if `n = 1` and `m = 2`, the program will incorrectly output "No" because `n - m` is not non-negative, even though it should be "No" because `n` is less than `m`.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
