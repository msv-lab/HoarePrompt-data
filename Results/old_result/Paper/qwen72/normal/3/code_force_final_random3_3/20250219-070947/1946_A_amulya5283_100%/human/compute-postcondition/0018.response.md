To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head: `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer minus 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `i` is `mdx + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(mdx, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop head variables are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mdx + 1`.
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `mdx + 2`.
   - `mdx` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

4. **Ensure the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`.

### Final State:
- `t` remains an input integer minus 1.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `mdx` remains `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `i` is now `mdx + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`.

State: **`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 1 or 2 based on the previous condition. Otherwise, `res` remains 0 or 1 based on the previous condition.**
