The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `cases`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `cases` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `cases` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2]. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52].**
