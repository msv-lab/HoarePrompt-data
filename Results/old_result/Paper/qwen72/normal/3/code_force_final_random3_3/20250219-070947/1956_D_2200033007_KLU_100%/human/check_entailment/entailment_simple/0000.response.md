### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing the MEX of that subarray, and setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - **Main Program**:
     - Reads the input, initializes the array, and calls `func_1` to compute the maximum sum.
     - Calls `func_2` to construct the sequence of operations.
     - Prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function computes the maximum sum for the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`.
     - It uses memoization to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
     - For a single element subarray, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself.
     - For a multi-element subarray, it recursively computes the maximum sum by considering different splits and the MEX of the subarray.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
     - It uses the result from `func_1` to determine the optimal subarray to modify.
     - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the length of the subarray, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" pattern.
     - Otherwise, it recursively finds the optimal split and combines the results.

   - **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**:
     - This function transforms a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where each element is equal to its index.
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form and returns if it is.
     - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and appends the necessary operations to `res`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Memoization in `func_1`**:
     - The use of `res_dict` ensures that the function does not recompute results for the same subarray, which is crucial for efficiency given the constraints.
     - The base case for a single element subarray is correctly handled by setting the value to the maximum of 1 and the element itself.

   - **Recursive Splitting in `func_1`**:
     - The function correctly explores all possible splits of the subarray and computes the MEX for each split.
     - The maximum sum is computed by considering the MEX of the subarray and the sums of the resulting subarrays.

   - **Operation Construction in `func_2`**:
     - The function correctly identifies the optimal subarray to modify based on the result from `func_1`.
     - It handles the base case for a single element subarray and the case where the subarray is already in the desired form.
     - The recursive calls ensure that the operations are constructed in a way that maximizes the sum.

   - **Staircase Transformation in `make_stairs`**:
     - The function correctly transforms the subarray into a "staircase" pattern where each element is equal to its index.
     - It appends the necessary operations to `res` and updates the array accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly structured and follows the logic required to solve the problem. The use of memoization, recursive splitting, and staircase transformation ensures that the maximum sum is achieved within the allowed number of operations.

**Correctness: True**
