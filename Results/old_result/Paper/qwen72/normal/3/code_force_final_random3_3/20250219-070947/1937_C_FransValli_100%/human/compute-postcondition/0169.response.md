Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.
   - If `res` is `<`, `arr` is `[2]`.
   - If `res` is `=`, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `arr` is `[0, 2]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses. Without the actual input responses, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `maxi`, but we know it is an index.
   - `arr` is determined by the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `<`, `arr` is `[2]`.
     - If `res` is `=`, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.
     - Otherwise, `arr` is `[0, 2]`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `arr[0]` will be the first element of the list `arr`, which depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `<`, `arr[0]` is 2.
     - If `res` is `=`, `arr[0]` is 0.
     - Otherwise, `arr[0]` is 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?` followed by the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`.
   - Since `i` is explicitly 3, we know that part of the output.
   - `arr[0]` will be either 2 or 0 depending on the value of `res`.
   - `maxi` is an index, but its exact value is not known without the input responses.

Given the above, the output will be:
Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3 (where [maxi] is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, and [arr[0]] is 2 if `res` is `<`, 0 if `res` is `=`, or 0 otherwise)**
