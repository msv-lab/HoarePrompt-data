Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are 0. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list, and `j` is `n - 2`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to 0. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to the maximum value between `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`. If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, `dp[n - 1][n - 2]`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`.***
