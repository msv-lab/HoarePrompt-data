Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is n-1, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0.** 

The list `a` is now sorted in descending order, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
