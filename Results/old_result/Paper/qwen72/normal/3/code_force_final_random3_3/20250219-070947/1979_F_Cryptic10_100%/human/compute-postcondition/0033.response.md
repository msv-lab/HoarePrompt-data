The only objects in the loop head are `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops`. Therefore, we can only adjust these objects to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers.
- `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple.
- `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list.
- `v1` and `v2` will be assigned from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list.
- `p1` has been updated to include `v1` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` has been updated to include `v1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The `ops` list must still contain at least one tuple (since we are iterating over the reversed list, the next tuple will be the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list).
- `v1` and `v2` will be assigned the values from the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and possibly `v1` if `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `p2` is a list that may contain `v1` if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `v1` and `v2` are assigned from the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list.**
