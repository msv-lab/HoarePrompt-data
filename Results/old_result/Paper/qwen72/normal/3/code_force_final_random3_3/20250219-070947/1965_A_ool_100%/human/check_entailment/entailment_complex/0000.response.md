### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of stones `arr` for each test case.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to determine the winner.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique stone counts `set_` from the input list `arr`.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - If the smallest number of stones in any pile is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. This is because Alice can choose `k` equal to the smallest pile size and win the game by emptying all piles in one move.

4. **Consecutive Differences Check:**
   - The function then iterates through the sorted unique stone counts to check if the differences between consecutive elements are all exactly 1.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, the function sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `not_c` remains `True` after the loop, it means all differences between consecutive elements are exactly 1, and the function toggles `A` one more time.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

### Issues:
- **Input Handling Bug:**
  - The line `n = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))` is incorrect. It should be `n = int(input().rstrip())` because `n` is a single integer, not a list.
- **Function Argument Type:**
  - The function `func_1` is expected to handle a single list of integers `arr`, not a list of lists. The comment suggests that `arr` is a list of lists, which is incorrect based on the problem description and the actual input handling.

### Correctness:
- The logic of the function `func_1` is correct for determining the winner based on the unique stone counts and their differences.
- However, the input handling is incorrect, which will cause the program to fail when processing the input.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has a bug in the input handling, which will prevent it from correctly processing the input and determining the winner for each test case. The function logic itself is correct, but the input handling needs to be fixed.
