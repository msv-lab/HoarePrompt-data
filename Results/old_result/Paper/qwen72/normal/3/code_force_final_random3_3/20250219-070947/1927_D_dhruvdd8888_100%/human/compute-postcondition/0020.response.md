Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to the element at index 1 of the list `nums`, if `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1 + s, 2, num)`, and `s` is 1. Otherwise, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 2, num)`, and `s` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new tuple to the list `arr`.
- The first element of the tuple is `1 + s`.
- The second element of the tuple is `i`, which is 2.
- The third element of the tuple is `num`, which is the element at index 1 of the list `nums`.
- If `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, `s` is 1, so the tuple appended is `(2, 2, num)`.
- If `nums[1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `s` is 0, so the tuple appended is `(1, 2, num)`.
- The values of `N`, `i`, `num`, and `s` remain unchanged.
