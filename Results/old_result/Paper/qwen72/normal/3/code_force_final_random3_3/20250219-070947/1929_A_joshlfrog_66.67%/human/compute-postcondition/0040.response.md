Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is the value of `nums[1]`, `x` is the value of `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` > 0, otherwise `x` remains 0. If `nums[1]` > `x`, then `x` is updated to the value of `nums[1]`.**
