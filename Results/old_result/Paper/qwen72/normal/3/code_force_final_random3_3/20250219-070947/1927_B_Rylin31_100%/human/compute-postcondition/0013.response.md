Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 0, `l` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of length `t` containing all zeros except `s[j]` which is now 3, `array` must have at least three integers, `j` is the third integer in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` and then the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.** 

Explanation: The value of `s[j]` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
