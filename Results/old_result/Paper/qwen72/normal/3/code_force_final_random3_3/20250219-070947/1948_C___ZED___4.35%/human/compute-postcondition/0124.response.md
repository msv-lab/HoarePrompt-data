Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` and `b` are input strings.
   - `k` is the last even number less than `n`.
   - `no_path` is currently True.

2. **Condition**:
   - The condition states that if `no_path` was False before entering the if condition, it remains False if any character at an odd index (1, 3, 5, ..., `k-1`) in `a` is not `>`.
   - Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

3. **Current Value of `no_path`**:
   - The current value of `no_path` is True.

4. **Execution of the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
   - This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `k`.

Since the `print` statement is simply printing a constant string 'YES', the output will be:

Output: **YES**
