Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, s is an input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B', ma is 0, mi is 0, m is an input integer.**

The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'. The code snippet `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to a new input string. The length of the new input string `s` is still `n`, and it must still consist of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'. The other variables `t`, `n`, `ma`, `mi`, and `m` remain unchanged.
