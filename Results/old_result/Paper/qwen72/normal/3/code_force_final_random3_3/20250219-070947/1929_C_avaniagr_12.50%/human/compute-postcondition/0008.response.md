Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, and the current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then the condition `a >= x + 1` holds. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`.***
