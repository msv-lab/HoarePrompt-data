Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from input, `a` is the second integer from input, `b` is the third integer from input, and `_` is 1. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged.***
