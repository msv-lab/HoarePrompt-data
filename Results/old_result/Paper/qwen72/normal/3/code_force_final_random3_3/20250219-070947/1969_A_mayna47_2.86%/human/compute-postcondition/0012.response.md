Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `2`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `i`, and the nested list `v`, but none of this information affects the `print` statement itself.
- The value `2` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
