Output State: **`j`, `t`, `_`, `n` retain their initial values. `i` is `n + 1`, `sum` is the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, plus the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` from 1 to `n` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or remains 0 if no such `i` exists.**

Explanation:
- `j`, `t`, `_`, and `n` are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
- `i` starts at `n` and is decremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `sum` is updated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If the condition is true, `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and if the condition is false, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.
- `r` is set to the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If no such `i` exists, `r` remains 0.
