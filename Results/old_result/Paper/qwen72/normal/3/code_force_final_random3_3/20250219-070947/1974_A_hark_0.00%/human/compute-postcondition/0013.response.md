Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **x and y are non-negative integers** such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
2. **x and y are assigned new values from user input**.
3. **Either x is 0 or y is 0**.
4. **It is not the case that (x == 0 and y > 0)**.
5. **It is not the case that (x > 0 and y == 0)**.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:
- If \(x\) is 0, then \(y\) must be 0 (because it cannot be the case that \(x == 0\) and \(y > 0\)).
- If \(y\) is 0, then \(x\) must be 0 (because it cannot be the case that \(x > 0\) and \(y == 0\)).

Therefore, the only possible values for \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy all the conditions are \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\).

Now, let's look at the code snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

This code snippet simply prints the integer 0. The values of \(x\) and \(y\) do not affect the output of this print statement.

Output: **0**
