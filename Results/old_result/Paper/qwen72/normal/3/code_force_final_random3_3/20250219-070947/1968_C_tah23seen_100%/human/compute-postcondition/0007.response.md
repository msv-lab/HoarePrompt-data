The code snippet `i -= 1` decrements the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 4`. Therefore, after decrementing `i`, the new value of `i` is `n - 5`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr).
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[n-2]` which is now `1000000000 - arr[n-2]` and `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[n-2]` which is now `1000000000 - arr[n-2]` and `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is `n - 5`.**
