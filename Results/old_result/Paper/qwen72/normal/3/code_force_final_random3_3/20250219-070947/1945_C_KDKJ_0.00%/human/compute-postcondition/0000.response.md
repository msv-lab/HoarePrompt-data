The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. Since the function `func_2` does not take any parameters, the state of the loop depends solely on the user input.

State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer, `_` is 0**
