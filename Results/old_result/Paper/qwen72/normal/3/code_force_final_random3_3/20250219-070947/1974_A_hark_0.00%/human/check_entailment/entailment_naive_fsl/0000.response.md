Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are a large number of 1x1 icons and a few 2x2 icons correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` for calculating the number of screens needed when both `x` and `y` are non-zero is flawed. The program incorrectly subtracts the number of 1x1 icons that could fit in the screens occupied by 2x2 icons, but it does not account for the fact that 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining spaces of the grid after placing the 2x2 icons.

For example, consider the input `x = 15` and `y = 1`. The program calculates:
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1` (1 screen for the 2x2 icon)
- `x = 15 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = 15 - 15 + 4 = 4` (remaining 1x1 icons)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(4 / 15) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (2 additional screens for the 1x1 icons)

The program outputs `3` screens, but the correct output should be `2` screens. This is because the 2x2 icon can be placed on one screen, and the 15 1x1 icons can be placed on the same screen, with the remaining 4 1x1 icons fitting on the second screen.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this input, making it incorrect.
