The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is `<`, `arr` is `[1]`. Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]` if `res` is not `=`, or `[0, 1]` if `res` is `=`.**
