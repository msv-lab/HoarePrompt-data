Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the last element and then the first element, followed by the second-to-last element and then the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` will be the last element in `new_arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `left` pointer will have moved to `n` and the `right` pointer will have moved to `-1`, effectively covering all elements in the list `arr`. The `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, where the elements are alternately taken from the end and the beginning of `arr`. If the length of `arr` is odd, the middle element will be the last element added to `new_arr`.
