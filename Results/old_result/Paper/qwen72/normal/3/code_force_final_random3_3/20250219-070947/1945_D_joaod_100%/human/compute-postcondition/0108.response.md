Postcondition: **`na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is -1, `total` is 0, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`). If `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and it is no longer the maximum representable floating-point number. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
