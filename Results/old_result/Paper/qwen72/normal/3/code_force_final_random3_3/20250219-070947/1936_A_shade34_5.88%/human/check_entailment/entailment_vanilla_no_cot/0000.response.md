Correctness: **True**

The program provided is designed to solve the problem by finding two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, using at most `3n` queries. The approach used in the program is as follows:

1. **Initialization and First Query Loop:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0, which will be used to track the index that, when ORed with itself, gives the maximum value among the first loop's queries.
   - It iterates over the range `1` to `n-1` and asks queries of the form `"? mak mak i i"`. This query checks if the OR of `p_mak` with itself is less than the OR of `p_i` with itself. If it is, `mak` is updated to `i`.

2. **Second Query Loop:**
   - The program initializes `mak2` to the value of `mak` and `pans` as an empty list.
   - It iterates over all indices `i` from `0` to `n-1` and asks queries of the form `"? mak mak2 i mak2"`. This query checks if the OR of `p_mak` with `p_mak2` is less than the OR of `p_i` with `p_mak2`. If it is, `mak` is updated to `i`, and `pans` is reset to `[i]`. If the OR values are equal, `i` is added to `pans`.

3. **Final Query Loop:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0 again and iterates over the list `pans`.
   - It asks queries of the form `"? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]"` to find the maximum OR value within the `pans` list. If the OR of `pans[mak]` with itself is less than the OR of `pans[i]` with itself, `mak` is updated to `i`.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the pair that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

The program ensures that the number of queries does not exceed `3n` by:
- Using `n-1` queries in the first loop.
- Using `n` queries in the second loop.
- Using at most `n-1` queries in the third loop (since `pans` can have at most `n` elements).

The logic of the program is sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
