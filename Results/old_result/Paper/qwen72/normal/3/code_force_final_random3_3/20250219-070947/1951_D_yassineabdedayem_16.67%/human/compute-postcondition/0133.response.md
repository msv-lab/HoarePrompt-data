Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is now equal to `k - Max`, `number` is now equal to `Min`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `k` after the update depends on the initial values of `k` and `Max`, but the new value of `k` is `k - Max`.
- The conditions that `k` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` still hold, but the new value of `k` might affect these conditions depending on the initial values of `k` and `Max`.
