The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop is controlled by the range of `i`, which is from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the loop should still be within the range defined by `int(input())`.

However, the state provided does not give us the exact value of `int(input())`, but we know that `i` must be less than `int(input())` for the loop to continue. Since `i` is `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n` and `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is n, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to n**
