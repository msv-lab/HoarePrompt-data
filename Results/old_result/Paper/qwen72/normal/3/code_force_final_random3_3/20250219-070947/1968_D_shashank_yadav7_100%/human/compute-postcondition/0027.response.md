Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`. If `k` is 0, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k - 2), a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)` and `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k - 2), a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `bm` and `sm` remain the same, as they depend on the value of `k` and the lists `a` and `p`.
