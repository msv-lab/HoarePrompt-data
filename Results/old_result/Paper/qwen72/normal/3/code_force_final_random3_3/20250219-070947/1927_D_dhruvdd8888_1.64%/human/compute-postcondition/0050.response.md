Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`N` is greater than or equal to 0**: This means `N` is a non-negative integer.
2. **`i` is `N`**: `i` is initialized to the value of `N`.
3. **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end**: `nums` is a list of integers where the last element is `-1`.
4. **`num` is `-1`**: `num` is set to `-1`.
5. **`s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`**: `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` before the `-1`.
6. **`arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`**: `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`. The first element of each tuple is `1 + s`, the second element is `i`, and the third element is `num`.
7. **`LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1**: `LA` is the index of the last element in `arr`.
8. **`l` and `r` are input integers**: `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user.
9. **`eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`**: `eli` is the index of the first tuple in `arr` where the first element of the tuple is greater than or equal to `l`.
10. **`s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**: `s` is updated to the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
11. **`e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**: `e` is updated to the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
12. **`ppp` is 23 if `tc` is greater than 5, and `s` is less than or equal to `l`**: This condition is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
13. **Additionally, `e` is less than `r`, and `e` is less than `N`**: These conditions ensure that `e` is within certain bounds.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

2. **Understand the tuple structure**:
   - Each tuple in `arr` is of the form `(1 + s, i, num)`.
   - The first element of each tuple is `1 + s`, where `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - The second element of each tuple is `i`, which is initially `N`.

3. **Determine `eli`**:
   - `eli` is the index of the first tuple in `arr` where the first element of the tuple is greater than or equal to `l`.
   - Since the first element of each tuple is `1 + s`, `eli` will be the index of the first tuple where `1 + s >= l`.

4. **Update `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` is updated to the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e` is updated to the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`.

5. **Print `s` and `e + 1`**:
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `s` and `e + 1`.

### Final Output:
- `s` will be the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`, which is `1 + s` for the segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` that meets the condition.
- `e` will be the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`, which is `i` (initially `N`).

Since `s` is `1 + s` and `e` is `i` (which is `N`), and given the conditions that `e` is less than `r` and `e` is less than `N`, the output will be:

Output: **(1 + s, N + 1) (where s is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1` and N is the value of `N`)**
