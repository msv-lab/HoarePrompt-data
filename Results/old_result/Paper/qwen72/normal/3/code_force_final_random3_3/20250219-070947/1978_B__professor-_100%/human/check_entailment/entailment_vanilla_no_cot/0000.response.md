Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum profit when `b - a < n` is incorrect. The formula used in the `else` block does not correctly calculate the profit for the promotion and the regular prices.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b)
            profit_from_promotion = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k))
            profit_from_regular = (n - k) * a
            print(profit_from_promotion + profit_from_regular)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

However, this version is inefficient for large values of `n` and `b` due to the use of the `sum` function with a generator expression. A more efficient approach would be to use the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b)
            profit_from_promotion = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2
            profit_from_regular = (n - k) * a
            print(profit_from_promotion + profit_from_regular)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum profit in all cases and is efficient even for large inputs. The original program fails to correctly handle the case where `b - a < n` and the profit from the promotion and regular prices should be calculated separately.
