Output State: **`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `ps` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `ps` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `ps` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the elements at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `ps` which are 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0.**
