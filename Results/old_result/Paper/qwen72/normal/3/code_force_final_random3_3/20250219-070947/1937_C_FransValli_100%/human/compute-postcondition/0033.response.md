Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [1]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1] and `res` remains '='. Otherwise, `arr` remains [0] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is updated by the assignment `res = input()`, which means `res` now holds a new input string.
- The conditions for `arr` are still valid based on the new value of `res`.
- All other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `maxi`) remain unchanged.
