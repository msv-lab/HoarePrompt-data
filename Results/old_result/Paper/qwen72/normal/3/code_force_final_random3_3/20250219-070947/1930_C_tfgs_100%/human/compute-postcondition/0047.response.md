Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` remains the same, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `adv` is calculated as the minimum of three values: `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.
- `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, and each element has been incremented by its index plus one.
- `i` has been incremented by 1, so the value of `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `len(a)`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `adv` depends on the values of `a[i - 1]`, `a[i]`, `cnt`, and `cur`.
