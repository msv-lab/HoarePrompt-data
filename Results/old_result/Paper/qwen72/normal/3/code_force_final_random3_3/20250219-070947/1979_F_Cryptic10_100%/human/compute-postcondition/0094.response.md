Output State: **`v1` has been removed from `vx`, `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains tuples based on the value of `v2` as described in the initial state, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` now contains at least 1 element, `v3` has been removed from `vx`.**

Explanation:
- `v3` is the first element of the tuple returned by `q(0)`, and it is removed from `vx`.
- After removing `v3`, `vx` now contains at least 1 element (since it originally contained at least 2 elements).
- All other variables (`v1`, `v2`, `ops`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged and retain their initial states.
