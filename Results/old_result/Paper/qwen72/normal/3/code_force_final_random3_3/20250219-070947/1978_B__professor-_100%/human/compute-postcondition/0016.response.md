Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` still holds.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, then either `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or `b - a` is less than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Values:**
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `n` is the number of elements.
   - `a` is the starting value.
   - `b` is the ending value.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - If `b <= a`, the condition `b <= a` holds.
   - If `b > a`, then either `b - a >= n` or `b - a < n`.

3. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
   - Let's denote `d = b - a`.
   - The expression becomes: `int(d * (d + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
     - In this case, `d = b - a` is non-positive (i.e., \( d \leq 0 \)).
     - The term `d * (d + 1) // 2` will be 0 because \( d \leq 0 \).
     - The expression simplifies to: `int(0 + a * n) = a * n`.
     - Therefore, the output will be: `a * n`.

   - **Case 2: \( b > a \)**
     - **Subcase 2.1: \( b - a \geq n \)**
       - Here, `d = b - a` is at least `n`.
       - The term `d * (d + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `d` positive integers.
       - The expression becomes: `int(d * (d + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
       - Since `d >= n`, the term `d * (d + 1) // 2` will be a positive integer.
       - The output will be: `int(d * (d + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

     - **Subcase 2.2: \( b - a < n \)**
       - Here, `d = b - a` is less than `n`.
       - The term `d * (d + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `d` positive integers.
       - The expression becomes: `int(d * (d + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
       - The output will be: `int(d * (d + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

### Final Output:
- If `b <= a`, the output will be: `a * n`.
- If `b > a`, the output will be: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n) (where `b - a` is the difference between `b` and `a`, and `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`)**.
