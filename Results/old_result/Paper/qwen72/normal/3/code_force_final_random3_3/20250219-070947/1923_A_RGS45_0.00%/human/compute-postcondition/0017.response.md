Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = str(input(''))` updates the value of `arr` to a new input string.
- The initial state variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged except for `arr`.
- `arr` is now the input string provided by the user.
- `x` is still the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `y` is still the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `z` is still the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.
