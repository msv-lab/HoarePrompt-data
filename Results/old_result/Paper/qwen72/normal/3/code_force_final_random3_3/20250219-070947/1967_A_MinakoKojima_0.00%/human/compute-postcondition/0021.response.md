Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, both greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is now equal to `a[0] * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now equal to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.
- Initially, `ans` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `i` is 1, so `a[i]` is `a[1]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`.
- Therefore, `ans` is updated to `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
