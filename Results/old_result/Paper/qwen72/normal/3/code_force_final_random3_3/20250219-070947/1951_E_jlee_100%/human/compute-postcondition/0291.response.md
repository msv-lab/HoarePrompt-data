Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` is greater than or equal to 0, and `count2` is either unchanged or increased by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, `count2` is increased by 1 and `done` remains unchanged. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0 and `done` remains unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True.***
