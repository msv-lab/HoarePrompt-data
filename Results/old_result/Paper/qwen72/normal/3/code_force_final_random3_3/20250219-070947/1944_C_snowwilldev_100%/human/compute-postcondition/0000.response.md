Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `N` such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < N for all elements a_i in the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `N` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
