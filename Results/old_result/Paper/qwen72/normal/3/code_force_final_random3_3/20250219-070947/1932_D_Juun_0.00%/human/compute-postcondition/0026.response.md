Output State: **The number of rounds `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings where each card string is two characters long, `card` is the next card string in the list, `rank` is the first character of the next `card`, `suit` is the second character of the next `card`, `cards` must have at least one more unprocessed card string.**

The code snippet `rank, suit = card` assigns the first character of the `card` string to the variable `rank` and the second character of the `card` string to the variable `suit`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
