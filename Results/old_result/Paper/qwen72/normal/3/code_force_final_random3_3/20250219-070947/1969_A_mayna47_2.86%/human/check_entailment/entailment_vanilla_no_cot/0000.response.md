Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization of `v`**: The program initializes `v` as a list of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. It then reassigns `v` to a list of size `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the rest are the input values. This is redundant and can be simplified to just one assignment.

2. **Special Case for `n == 2`**: The program correctly handles the case where `n == 2` by printing 2, which is the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure both friends come to the party.

3. **Checking for Cycles of Length 3**: The program checks if there is a cycle of length 3 (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a cycle exists, it prints 2 and returns. This is incorrect because a cycle of length 3 does not necessarily mean that only 2 invitations are needed. For example, in the case where `p = [2, 3, 1]`, all three friends are part of a cycle, and sending invitations to any two friends will not ensure that all three come to the party.

4. **Default Case**: The program prints 3 if no cycle of length 3 is found. This is also incorrect because there are cases where fewer than 3 invitations are needed. For example, if `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`, sending invitations to friends 1 and 2 will ensure that both come to the party, and the same for friends 3 and 4.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Identify all pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
- Ensure that at least one pair is invited.
- If no such pairs exist, find the smallest set of friends to invite such that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    p = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
        return
    
    # Create a set of pairs (i, p[i]) where p[p[i]] == i
    pairs = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if p[p[i]] == i:
            pairs.add((min(i, p[i]), max(i, p[i])))
    
    # If there is at least one pair, we need to invite both friends in the pair
    if pairs:
        print(2)
        return
    
    # If no pairs, find the smallest set of friends to invite such that at least 2 come
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    min_invitations = n
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            count = 0
            j = i
            while not visited[j]:
                visited[j] = True
                j = p[j]
                count += 1
            min_invitations = min(min_invitations, count)
    
    print(min_invitations)
```

This corrected version correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and handles the case where no such pairs exist by finding the smallest cycle and ensuring at least 2 friends come to the party.
