The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `mdx`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1.
- `n` is the new input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `i` is `mdx + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is `mdx + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`.

State: **`t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**
