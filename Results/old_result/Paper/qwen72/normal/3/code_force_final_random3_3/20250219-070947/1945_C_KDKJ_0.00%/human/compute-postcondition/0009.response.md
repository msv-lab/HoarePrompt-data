Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least one character, `s` is the first character of `a`. If `s` is '0', `x` is 1 and `y` is 0. If `s` is '1', `x` is 0 and `y` is 1. In both cases, `S` remains a list containing a single sublist `[0, 0]`.***
