### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then reassemble them into a different rectangle (considering rotations as the same).

To solve this, consider the following points:
1. **Cutting the Rectangle**: Bob can only cut the rectangle parallel to one of its sides, resulting in two rectangles with integer sides.
2. **Reassembling the Rectangles**: After cutting, Bob can rotate and reassemble the two resulting rectangles to form a new rectangle.
3. **Condition for Reassembly**: For Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even. This is because:
   - If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles and reassemble them into a \( 2 \times \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangle.
   - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles and reassemble them into a \( a \times 2 \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, any cut will result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and reassembling them will always result in the original \(a \times b\) rectangle or its rotation.

The provided program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'No'.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the problem description. It checks the parity of the dimensions and prints the appropriate result for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
