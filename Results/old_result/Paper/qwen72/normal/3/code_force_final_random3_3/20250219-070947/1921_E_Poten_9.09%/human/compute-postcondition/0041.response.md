Postcondition: ***`answers` is an empty list, or a list containing the string 'Draw' or 'Bob'. `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged. `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, with `clues[2]` less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` not equal to 1, and both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` being either even or both odd. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2. Otherwise, `answers` contains `['Bob']`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, `answers` contains 'Draw' if either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if either the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the condition `(clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If `clues[3]` is not greater than `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, `answers` remains an empty list.***
