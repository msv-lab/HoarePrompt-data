Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `possible` is False, `i` is 0, and the first element of `c` is equal to the first element of `a` or the first element of `b`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop.**
