Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains the entry `{'a': char}` if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. If `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The code `decoded.append(mapping[char])` appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the list `decoded`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` will contain the value of `mapping[char]`. If `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, `decoded` will contain the character 'a'. The states of `encoded`, `char`, and `mapping` remain unchanged. If `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
