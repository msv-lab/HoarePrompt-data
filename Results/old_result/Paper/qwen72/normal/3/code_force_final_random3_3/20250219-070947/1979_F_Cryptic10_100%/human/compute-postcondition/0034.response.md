Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and possibly `v1` if `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `p2` is a list that may contain `v1` if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `v1` and `v2` are assigned from the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and `p1` or `p2` has `v1` appended to it depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` or not.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `v1` to `p2` if the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`.
- If `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `vx`, `ops`, and the conditions for `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `v1` and `v2` are determined by the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and this does not change.
- The lists `p1` or `p2` are updated by appending `v1` to them, depending on the condition.
