Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

1. The program does not handle the input correctly. The function `func_1()` is called inside a loop, but the input for the number of test cases is not consumed before the loop. This will cause the first input to be treated as the number of rounds for the first test case, which is incorrect.

2. The program does not correctly handle the case where there are no trumps available to beat a non-trump card. The logic for appending to `answers` and checking if `trumps` is empty should be more robust to ensure that a valid sequence of rounds is constructed.

3. The program does not sort the non-trump cards by rank before attempting to match them. This can lead to incorrect pairings where a higher-ranked card is used to beat a lower-ranked card, which is not allowed.

4. The program does not handle the case where there are more non-trump cards than trumps, and it is impossible to beat all non-trump cards with the available trumps.

5. The program does not check if the constructed sequence of rounds is valid, meaning it does not verify that all cards are used exactly once and that the rules of the game are followed.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Consume the input for the number of test cases before the loop.
- Sort the non-trump cards by rank before attempting to match them.
- Ensure that there are enough trumps to beat all non-trump cards.
- Verify that the constructed sequence of rounds is valid before printing the answers.
