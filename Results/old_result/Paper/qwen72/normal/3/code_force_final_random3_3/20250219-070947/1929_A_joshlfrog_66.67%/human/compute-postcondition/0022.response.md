Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, and `y` is 100000000 or the value of `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is less than 100000000. If `nums[2]` is greater than `x`, `x` is updated to `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `x` remains the same. If `nums[2]` is less than `y`, `y` is updated to `nums[2]`.***
