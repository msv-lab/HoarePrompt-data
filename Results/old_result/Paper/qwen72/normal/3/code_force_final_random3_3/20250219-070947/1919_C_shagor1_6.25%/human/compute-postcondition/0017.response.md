To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for a in inp:
```

The objects in the loop head are:
- `a`: The current element being iterated over in the list `inp`.
- `inp`: The list of integers being iterated over.

The loop will execute one more time if there are more elements in the list `inp` to iterate over. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
   - `a` is the first element of `inp`.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1`.
   - If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `x` remains `n + 1` and `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is set to 1.

2. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop head `for a in inp:` will move to the next element in the list `inp`.
   - Therefore, `a` will now be the second element of `inp`.
   - The list `inp` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` remains the same (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).
   - `a` is now the second element of `inp`.
   - `_` remains 0.
   - `inp` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `ans` remains the same (0 or 1, depending on the condition in the previous iteration).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the second element of `inp`, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, and `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on the condition in the previous iteration).**
