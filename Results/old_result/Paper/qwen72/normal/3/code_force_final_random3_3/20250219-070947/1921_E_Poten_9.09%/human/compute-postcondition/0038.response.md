Postcondition: ***`answers` is an empty list or a list containing the string 'Draw' or 'Bob'. `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, and both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either even or both are odd. Additionally, `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1. If the condition `(clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'.***
