Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is the count of how many times the first element of `eta` appears in `w`, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `res` by adding the result of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value.
- Since `j` is 1, `eta[1]` refers to the second element in the `eta` list.
- `q[eta[1]]` is the count of how many times the second element of `eta` appears in `w`.
- The expression `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` calculates the number of combinations of 3 elements from `q[eta[1]]` occurrences.
- The new value of `res` is the sum of its previous value and the result of the above expression.
