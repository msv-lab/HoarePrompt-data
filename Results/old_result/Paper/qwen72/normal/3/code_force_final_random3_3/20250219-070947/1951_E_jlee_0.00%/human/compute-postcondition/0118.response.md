Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count` > 0, `count2` is 0 or 1, and `done` remains False. If `count` <= 0, `done` remains False and `count2` is 0.***
