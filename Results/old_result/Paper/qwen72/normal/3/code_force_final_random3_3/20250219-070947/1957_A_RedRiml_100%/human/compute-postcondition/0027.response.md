Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `palka`.
- For each element `i` in `palka`:
  - If `i` is not already a key in the dictionary `d`, it is added with a value of 1.
  - If `i` is already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.
  - If `i` is not already in the list `pl`, it is appended to `pl`.
- After the loop completes, `d` contains the count of each unique integer in `palka`, and `pl` contains all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
