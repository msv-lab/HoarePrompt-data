Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists and is different from `x`), and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^5.
- The variable `a` is the last element of the list `inp`.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `inp` is a list of integers from the input, and it must have at least `n` elements.
- The variable `x` is set to the smallest element in the list `inp`.
- The variable `y` is set to the second smallest element in the list `inp`, provided that it is different from `x`.
- The variable `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.
