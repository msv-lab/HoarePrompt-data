The code snippet provided is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Based on the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
- `j` is 4.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

The `print` statement converts the value of `j` to a string and concatenates it with a space and another string representation of `j`. Since `j` is explicitly given as 4, the string representation of `j` is '4'.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:
Output: **4 4**
