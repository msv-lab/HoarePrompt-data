Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The function checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. Specifically, if `n` is 2, it prints 'YES' if `s` is '00', otherwise 'NO'. For `n` greater than 2, it prints 'NO' if the number of '1's in `s` is odd, or if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1's. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0. **
