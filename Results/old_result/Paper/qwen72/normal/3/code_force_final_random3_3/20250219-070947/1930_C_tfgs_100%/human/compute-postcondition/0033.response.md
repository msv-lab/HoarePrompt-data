To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`. The loop will execute if `adv` is greater than 0, and `j` will start from 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`.
- `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.
- `cur` is the sum of the previous value of `cur` and `counter[a[i]]`.
- `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` or the difference between `n` and the length of `a` minus `adv`.
- `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i]` or the values `a[i - 1] - 1` to `a[i - 1] - adv` and `a[i]`.
- `j` is `adv - 1`.
- `a` must have at least `i + 1` elements.

For the loop to execute, `adv` must be greater than 0, and `j` must start from 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `adv` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0.

State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
