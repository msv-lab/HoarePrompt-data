Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`. Each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` in `S` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's (or any other character not '0') encountered in the string `a` up to that point.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations:
- The list `S` will have `n + 1` sublists.
- The first sublist in `S` will always be `[0, 0]`.
- Each subsequent sublist in `S` will have two numbers: the first number (`x`) is the count of '0's encountered so far, and the second number (`y`) is the count of all other characters encountered so far.
- The last sublist in `S` will contain the total counts of '0's and other characters in the entire string `a`.
