The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`.

- `b` is now a list of integers input by the user.
- The initial state of `t` being greater than 2, `_` being 2, `n` being an input integer, `a` being a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` being the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `i` exceeds the length of `a` or the loop ends, `i` being the index in `a` where the loop stopped or the length of `a` if the loop completed without `i` exceeding the length of `a`, and `j` being `n-1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `i` exceeds the length of `a` or the loop ends, `i` is the index in `a` where the loop stopped or the length of `a` if the loop completed without `i` exceeding the length of `a`, and `j` is `n-1`.**
