The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates in an environment where it can interactively make queries to find the maximum XOR of any two indices in a fixed permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries. After executing the function, it returns the indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize the XOR value `p_i ⊕ p_j`.
