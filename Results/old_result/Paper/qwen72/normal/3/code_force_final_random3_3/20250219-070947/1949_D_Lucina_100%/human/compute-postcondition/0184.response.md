Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. If either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
