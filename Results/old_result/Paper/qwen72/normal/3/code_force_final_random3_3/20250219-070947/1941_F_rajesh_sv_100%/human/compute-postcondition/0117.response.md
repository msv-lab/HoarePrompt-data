To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The loop has finished executing.
   - The final value of `ans` is the minimum value of the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` after each iteration of the loop.
   - The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the result of a series of calculations within a loop.
   - Specifically, `ans` is the minimum value of the maximum of two expressions: `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.
   - This means that after the loop, `ans` holds the smallest value among all the maximum values computed for each iteration.

3. **Understanding `next_max_diff`**:
   - `next_max_diff` is a variable whose value is given and remains unchanged.
   - It represents some precomputed or predefined value.

4. **What is printed**:
   - The `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Given the initial state, we can summarize the output as follows:

- `ans` is the minimum value of the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` after all iterations of the loop.
- `next_max_diff` is a predefined value that remains unchanged.

The print statement will compare these two values and print the larger one.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum value of the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f after each iteration of the loop, and next_max_diff is a predefined value)**
