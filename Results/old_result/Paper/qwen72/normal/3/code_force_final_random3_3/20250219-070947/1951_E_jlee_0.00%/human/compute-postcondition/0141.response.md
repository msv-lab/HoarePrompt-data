Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is 2, otherwise `count` remains unchanged. If `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, `done` is True, `count2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` == `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is True, `count2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` == `count` and `count` <= 1, `done` remains False, and `count2` is 0. If `count2` > `count`, `done` is True, `count2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False, and `count2` is 0.***
