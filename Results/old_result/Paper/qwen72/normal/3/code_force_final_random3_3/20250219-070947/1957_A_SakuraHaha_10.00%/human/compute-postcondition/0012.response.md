Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `cnt` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the value of the first key in `cnt`, `ans` is increased by `x` // 4.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is the count of the first key in the dictionary `cnt`.
- The value of `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `x` by 4.
- The values of `a` and `cnt` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `cnt` must have at least one key-value pair remains valid.
