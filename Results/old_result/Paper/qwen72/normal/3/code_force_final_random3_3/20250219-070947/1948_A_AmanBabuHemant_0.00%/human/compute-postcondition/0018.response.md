Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`.
   - If `n` is even:
     - `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
     - The length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which remains less than 200 if it was initially less than 200, or greater than or equal to 200 if it was initially greater than or equal to 200.
     - `t` is decremented by 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string 'YES'.
   - The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`, the `print` statement will always output 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
