Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the tree is a single edge connecting two nodes. In such a case, the starting node will have only one neighbor, and the first player (Ron) will always be forced to move the stone to the only available inactive neighbor. The second player (Hermione) will then have no valid moves and will lose. However, the program's logic in `func_1` and the final decision in `func_2` does not account for this scenario. Specifically, `func_1` returns `[0]` for a leaf node, which is incorrect because the distance from a leaf node to its parent should be `1`. This can lead to incorrect results when the tree is very simple, such as a single edge.

Example input where the program fails:
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
Expected output:
```
Hermione
```
Actual output:
```
Ron
