Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is '='.
   - `arr` is a list containing integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `mini` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `'?'` is a string literal.
   - `mini` is 0 (as given in the initial state).
   - `item` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `item` is used in the print statement, we need to infer its value. Given the context, `item` is likely to be the same as `i`, which is `n-1`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The string `'?'` will be printed.
   - The value of `mini` (which is 0) will be printed twice.
   - The value of `item` (which is `n-1`) will be printed twice.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 [n-1] [n-1] (where [n-1] is the value of `item` which is `n-1`)**
