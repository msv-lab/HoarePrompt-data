The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `piles` where each inner list contains integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The integer `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each `n` (the length of the inner lists) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases should not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if the first player can win the game given the number of stones in each pile. If the first player can win, the function returns "First"; otherwise, it returns "Second".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. It returns a list of strings, where each string is "First" if the first player can win the game for the corresponding test case, and "Second" otherwise.**
