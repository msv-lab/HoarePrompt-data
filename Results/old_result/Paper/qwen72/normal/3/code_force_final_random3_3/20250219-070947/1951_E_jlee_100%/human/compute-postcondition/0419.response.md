Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` and `count2` remain unchanged.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is incremented by 1 and `done` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, if `count` is 1 or greater, `done` remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `j`**: `j` is 2.
2. **Value of `string[:j - 1]`**: This will print the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j - 1` (which is index 1). So, it will print the first character of `string`.
3. **Value of `string[j - 1:]`**: This will print the substring of `string` starting from index `j - 1` (which is index 1) to the end of the string. So, it will print the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
The print statement will split the string `string` into two parts:
- The first part will be the substring from the start up to but not including the second character.
- The second part will be the substring from the second character to the end.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of the string starting from the second character]**

For example, if `string` is "hello":
- `string[:j - 1]` will be "h".
- `string[j - 1:]` will be "ello".

So, the output will be:
Output: **h, ello**
