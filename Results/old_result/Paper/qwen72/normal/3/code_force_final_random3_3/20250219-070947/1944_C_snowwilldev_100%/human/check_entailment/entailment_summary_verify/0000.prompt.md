You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from the input. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function iterates through the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and checks the count of each integer. If it finds two or more unique integers that occur exactly once, or if it finds an integer that does not occur in the list, it returns the first such integer. If no such integer is found, the function does not return a value and the state remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that Bob can choose elements that are not in the optimal path to minimize the MEX.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this test case, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 2. Now, `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
2. Bob picks 0. Now, `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
3. Alice picks 1. Now, `a = [2]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
4. Bob picks 2. Now, `a = []` and `c = [2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is 3, but the program returns 2 because it does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both players. The program only checks the count of each element and returns the first index where the count is 0 or the count of two elements is 1, which is not the correct approach to determine the MEX in this game.
