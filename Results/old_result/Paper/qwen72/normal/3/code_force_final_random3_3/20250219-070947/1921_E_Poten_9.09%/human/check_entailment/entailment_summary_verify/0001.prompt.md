You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It determines the outcome of each test case based on the relative positions and values of `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`, and prints the result for each test case, which can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input values and the number of test cases remain unchanged, and the results of all test cases have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values and stores them in a list called `clues`.

2. **Winning Conditions**:
   - **Draw Condition**: If Alice's chip is already in the last row (`x_a == h`) or Bob's chip is already in the first row (`x_b == 1`), or if Alice's chip is initially below Bob's chip (`x_a > x_b`), the game is a draw because no player can make a move that would result in a win.
   - **Row Parity Condition**: If both `x_a` and `x_b` are either even or odd, the game can be analyzed based on the column positions:
     - If Alice's and Bob's chips are in the same column (`y_a == y_b`), Bob wins because he can always move to Alice's position.
     - If the absolute difference in column positions is greater than 1 (`abs(y_a - y_b) > 1`), the game can be a draw if the distance in rows is too large for Bob to catch up.
     - If the absolute difference in column positions is 1 or less, Bob wins because he can always move to Alice's position.

3. **Alice's Winning Conditions**:
   - If Alice's chip is in a different row parity compared to Bob's chip (one is even, the other is odd), the game can be analyzed based on the column positions:
     - If Alice's and Bob's chips are in the same column (`y_a == y_b`), Alice wins because she can always move to Bob's position.
     - If the absolute difference in column positions is greater than 1 (`abs(y_a - y_b) > 1`), the game can be a draw if the distance in rows is too large for Alice to catch up.
     - If the absolute difference in column positions is 1 or less, Alice wins because she can always move to Bob's position.

4. **Output**:
   - The function appends the result of each test case to a list called `answers`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `answers` list.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Draw Condition**:
  - The condition `if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1` correctly identifies when Alice's chip is below Bob's chip or when the board has only one row, resulting in a draw.
  - However, the condition `clues[0] == 1` is redundant because if `h == 1`, Alice and Bob cannot move, and the game is a draw by default.

- **Row Parity Condition**:
  - The condition `elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)` correctly checks if both `x_a` and `x_b` are either even or odd.
  - The subsequent logic to determine Bob's win or draw is complex and may not cover all edge cases correctly.

- **Alice's Winning Conditions**:
  - The condition `elif clues[3] == clues[5]` correctly identifies when Alice and Bob are in the same column, and Alice wins.
  - The subsequent logic to determine Alice's win or draw is also complex and may not cover all edge cases correctly.

### Simplified Correctness Check:

- **Draw Condition**:
  - If `x_a == h` or `x_b == 1` or `x_a > x_b`, the game is a draw.
  - If `h == 1`, the game is a draw.

- **Bob's Winning Condition**:
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` are of the same parity and `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins.
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` are of the same parity and `abs(y_a - y_b) <= 1`, Bob wins.

- **Alice's Winning Condition**:
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` are of different parities and `y_a == y_b`, Alice wins.
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` are of different parities and `abs(y_a - y_b) <= 1`, Alice wins.

### Conclusion:

The given program has some logical issues and does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the conditions for determining Bob's and Alice's wins are overly complex and may not cover all scenarios correctly. A more straightforward approach would be to simplify the conditions and ensure all edge cases are handled.
