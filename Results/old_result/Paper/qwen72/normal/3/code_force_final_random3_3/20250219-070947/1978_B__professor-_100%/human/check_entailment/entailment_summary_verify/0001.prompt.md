You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`. The function then evaluates and prints a result based on the following conditions for each test case:
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a`.
- If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints the result of the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
- Otherwise, it prints the result of the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.

After executing `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price will not be higher.
   - If `b > a`, we need to consider the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)\).
   - This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{k \times (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}\).
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price is \((n - k) \times a\).

4. **Maximizing Profit:**
   - We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.
   - If `b - a < n`, the optimal `k` is `b - a` because selling more buns at the modified price will result in a price lower than `a` for some buns, which is not optimal.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the optimal `k` is `n` because all buns can be sold at a price higher than or equal to `a`.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks if `b <= a`:
     - If true, it prints `n * a` (all buns sold at the usual price).
   - If `b > a`, it checks if `b - a >= n`:
     - If true, it prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\) (all buns sold at the modified price).
   - If `b - a < n`, it prints \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\) (first `b - a` buns sold at the modified price, and the remaining buns sold at the usual price).

6. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `b <= a` and `b - a >= n`.
   - The formula for the profit when `b - a < n` is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
