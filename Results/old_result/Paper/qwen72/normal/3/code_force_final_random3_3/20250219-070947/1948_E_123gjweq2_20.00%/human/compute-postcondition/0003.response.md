Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `not_mid` as `right - left + 1 - mid`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `not_mid` is derived from the existing values of `right`, `left`, and `mid`.
