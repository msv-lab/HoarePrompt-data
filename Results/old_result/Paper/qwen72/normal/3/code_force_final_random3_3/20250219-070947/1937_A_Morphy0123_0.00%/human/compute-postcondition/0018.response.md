Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}}\).
   - `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\) minus 1.
   - `power` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding `power`:**
   - `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\) minus 1.
   - This means \(2^{\text{power}} < n \leq 2^{\text{power} + 1}\).

3. **Calculating `2 ** power`:**
   - Since `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} < n\), the value of `2 ** power` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - If `n` is 10, then the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 10 is \(2^4 = 16\).
   - Therefore, `power` is \(4 - 1 = 3\).
   - So, `2 ** power` is \(2^3 = 8\).

5. **General Case:**
   - For any given `n`, `2 ** power` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`.

Given this understanding, the `print(2 ** power)` statement will output the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} < n \leq 2^{\text{power} + 1}\))**
