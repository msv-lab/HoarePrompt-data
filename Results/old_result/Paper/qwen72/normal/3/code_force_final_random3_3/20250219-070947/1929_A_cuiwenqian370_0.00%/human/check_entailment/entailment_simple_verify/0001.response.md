### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty, and we need to find the maximum possible beauty.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
   - This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is a good starting point because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
   - **Constructing the New Array**:
     - The program uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to select elements from the sorted array.
     - It alternates between appending the largest (`arr[right]`) and smallest (`arr[left]`) elements to the new array.
     - If `left` and `right` are the same, it appends the single remaining element.
   - **Calculating the Beauty**:
     - The program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.
     - The absolute difference is used to ensure that the differences are always positive, which is necessary for maximizing the beauty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The problem guarantees that `n` is at least 2, so this case is not applicable.
   - **All Elements are the Same**: If all elements are the same, the beauty will be 0, which is correct.
   - **Mixed Elements**: The alternating approach ensures that the largest and smallest differences are used, which should maximize the beauty.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and multiple test cases.
   - The logic for constructing the new array and calculating the beauty is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

However, there is a subtle issue with the problem's definition of beauty. The problem states that the beauty is the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. This means that the beauty is not the sum of the absolute differences, but rather the sum of the raw differences. The program calculates the absolute differences, which is incorrect for the problem's definition.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the correct beauty should be `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- For the input `[69, 69, 69]`, the correct beauty should be `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`.
- For the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the correct beauty should be calculated as follows:
  - Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - New array: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
  - Beauty: `(43 - 100) + (90 - 43) + (54 - 90) + (80 - 54) = -57 + 47 - 36 + 26 = 0`
  - The program calculates the absolute differences, which would give a different result.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is incorrect because it calculates the absolute differences instead of the raw differences as required by the problem's definition of beauty.

Final: **False**
