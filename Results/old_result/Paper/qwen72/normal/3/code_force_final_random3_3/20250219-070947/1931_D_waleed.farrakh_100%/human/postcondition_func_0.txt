The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of integers). For each tuple, the function calculates the number of pairs `(a, b)` in `arr` such that `(-a % x + x) % x == a % x` and `a % y == b % y`, and appends this count to the `results` list. The function returns the `results` list, which contains the final count for each tuple in `test_cases`. After the function concludes, `test_cases` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the counts as described.
