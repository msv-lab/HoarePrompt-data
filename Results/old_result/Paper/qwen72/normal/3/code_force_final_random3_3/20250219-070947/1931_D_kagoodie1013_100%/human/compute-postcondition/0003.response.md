Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.** 

The code initializes an empty dictionary `residue_map`, which is now part of the output state. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `(n, x, y, arr)`, and `count`) remain unchanged.
