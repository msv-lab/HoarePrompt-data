Initial State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `j` is explicitly set to 5.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `'5'`.
3. The `print` statement concatenates two instances of the string `'5'` with a space in between, resulting in the string `'5 5'`.

Output: **5 5**
