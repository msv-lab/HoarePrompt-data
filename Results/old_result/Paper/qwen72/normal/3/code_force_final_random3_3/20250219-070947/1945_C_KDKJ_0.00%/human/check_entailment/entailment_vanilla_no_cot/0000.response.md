Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is handled correctly in `func_2`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: In `func_1`, the program calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones for the string `a`. This is done using a list `S` where each element is a pair `[x, y]` representing the count of zeros and ones up to that point. This is a correct approach to keep track of the cumulative counts.

3. **Condition Checking**: The program iterates through each possible position to place the road and checks if the condition for both sides is satisfied:
   - For the left side: `left * 2 < lsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied.
   - For the right side: `right * 2 < rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied.
   - If both conditions are met, it checks if the current position is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position.

4. **Output**: The program prints the position of the house after which the road should be laid, which is the correct output format.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.

The logic and implementation are sound, and the program should work correctly for the given problem constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
