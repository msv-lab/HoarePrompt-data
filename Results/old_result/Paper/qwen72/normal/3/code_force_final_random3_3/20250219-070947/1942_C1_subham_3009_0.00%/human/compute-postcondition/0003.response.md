Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `t` is now `t - 1`**. The function `func` is still not properly defined to solve the given problem, and it should be defined as `def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. The program is still running as the main module.
