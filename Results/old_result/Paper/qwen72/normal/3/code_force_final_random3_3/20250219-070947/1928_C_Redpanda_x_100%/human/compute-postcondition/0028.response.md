Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k]` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, and the loop has yielded values `factor * primes[k]^0`, `factor * primes[k]^1`, ..., `factor * primes[k]^(factors[prime])`.**

### Explanation:
- **`k`**: Remains a non-negative integer within the bounds of the `primes` list.
- **`primes`**: The list of prime numbers remains unchanged.
- **`rest`**: Still an iterable with at least one more element, as required by the initial state.
- **`prime`**: Still equal to `primes[k]`.
- **`factor`**: Still the next element of `rest`.
- **`prime_to_i`**: After all iterations, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k]` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`. This is because `prime_to_i` is multiplied by `primes[k]` in each iteration, and the loop runs `factors[prime] + 1` times.
- **`factors[prime]`**: Remains a non-negative integer, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **Yielded Values**: The loop yields `factor * primes[k]^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `factors[prime]`. This means the values `factor * 1`, `factor * primes[k]`, `factor * primes[k]^2`, ..., `factor * primes[k]^(factors[prime])` are yielded.
