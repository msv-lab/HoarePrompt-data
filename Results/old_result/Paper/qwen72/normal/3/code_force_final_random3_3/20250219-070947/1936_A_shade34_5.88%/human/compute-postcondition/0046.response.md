Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer input such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^3, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`), `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is not equal to `=`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is equal to `=`.**
