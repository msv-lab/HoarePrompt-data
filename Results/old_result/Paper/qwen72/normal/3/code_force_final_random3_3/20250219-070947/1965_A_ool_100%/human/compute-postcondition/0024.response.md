Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of lists, `t` is the length of `arr`, `A` is the result of toggling `A` based on the number of iterations, `set_` is a list of unique lists from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is the last index of `set_` that was checked. The current value of `not_c` is True, indicating that no difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1.**
