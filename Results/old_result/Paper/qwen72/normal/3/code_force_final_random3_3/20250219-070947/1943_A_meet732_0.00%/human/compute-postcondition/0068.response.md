Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `c` is `c - 1` (though `c` is not used in the print statement, it is mentioned in the initial state).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly set to 3 in the initial state.
   - The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`.

Since `j` is explicitly defined as 3, the output of the `print(j)` statement will be:

Output: **3**
