Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `n` is even.
   - `a` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
   - `b` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(n // 2 * b)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will always yield an integer.
   - The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the value of `n` as \( n \).
   - The value of `n // 2` will be \( \frac{n}{2} \) (since `n` is even, this is an integer).
   - The value of `n // 2 * b` will be \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \).

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. However, we know that `n` is an even integer between 1 and 100, and `b` is an integer between 1 and 30.

Output: **\(\frac{n}{2} \times b\) (where \( n \) is an even integer between 1 and 100, and \( b \) is an integer between 1 and 30)**
