Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is greater than 1.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user.
4. If `x` is less than `k - 1`:
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`.
5. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`:
   - If `x` is equal to `k - 1`:
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.
     - Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`.
   - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`:
     - `z` is `x + 1`.
     - `i` is `x`.
     - `x + 1` is greater than `x`.
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is less than `x + 1`.

Given the complexity of the conditions, the `print('NO')` statement does not depend on any of these conditions. It is a simple print statement that will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
