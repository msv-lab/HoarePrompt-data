Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, `n` is not 1, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`, the current count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, `n` is an odd number, and the middle element of `s` (i.e., `s[(n - 1) // 2]`) is not equal to `x`.**
