Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to either 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1, `maxx` remains either 0, `abs(arr[0] - minn)`, or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, and `mex` is a list containing either [0, 1], [abs(arr[0] - minn), 0], [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)], or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)] with the updated `minn` appended to it. If `minn` is not equal to `maxx`, the variables `minn`, `maxx`, and `mex` retain their initial values.***
