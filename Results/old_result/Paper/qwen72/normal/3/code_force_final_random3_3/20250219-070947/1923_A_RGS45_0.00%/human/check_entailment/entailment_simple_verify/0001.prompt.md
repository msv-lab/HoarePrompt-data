You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell containing a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the last `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed last `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the last `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (from the left).
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (from the right). This is equivalent to finding the index of the last chip from the left by subtracting the result from `n`.

3. **Extracting the Subarray:**
   - The program then extracts the subarray `z` that contains all the cells from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This is done using `arr[x:n - y]`.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the subarray `z` using `z.count('0')`.
   - The number of free cells in this subarray represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips so that they form a single block without any free cells between them.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the first and last chip in the ribbon.
- By extracting the subarray from the first chip to the last chip, it ensures that only the relevant portion of the ribbon is considered.
- Counting the number of free cells in this subarray gives the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where there are no free cells between the chips (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1 1`), correctly outputting `0`.
- It also handles cases where the chips are already in a single block but not at the beginning or end of the ribbon (e.g., `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`), correctly outputting the number of free cells between the chips.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should work for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
