Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the given problem. It should be defined as `def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y = 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is currently running as the main module. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    print(x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `t` is now `t - 1`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are input integers; `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the first `x` strings in the original `arr` to integers.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer greater than 2 and is now `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers of length `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer greater than 2 and is now `t - 3` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers representing the first `x` input values.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
