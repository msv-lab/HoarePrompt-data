Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, the output buffer has been flushed, and `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1 if the user input is `>` for the current iteration, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution and must have at least 2 elements, the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the user input is not `>`, otherwise `mak` is 2. `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution and must have at least 3 elements, the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 3, `mak` is 1 if the user input is not `>`, otherwise `mak` is 3, `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution and must have at least 4 elements, the output buffer has been flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
