The code snippet `freq[current_pair] += 1` increments the value of `freq[current_pair]` by 1. This means that the value associated with the key `current_pair` in the dictionary `freq` is increased by 1. The value of `count` is also updated to reflect the new value of `freq[current_pair]`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1, and `count` is updated to the previous value of `count` plus the new value of `freq[current_pair]`.**
