Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<` and must have at least 4 elements. If `res` is `'>`, `mini` is the fourth element in `arr`, and `item` is the fourth element in `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the third element in `arr`, and `item` is the fourth element in `arr`.***
