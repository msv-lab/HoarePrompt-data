The value of `sum` is incremented by `i * n`. The initial value of `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The value of `i` is 2, and `n` is a new input integer greater than 0. Therefore, `i * n` is `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n` and `r` is 0.**
