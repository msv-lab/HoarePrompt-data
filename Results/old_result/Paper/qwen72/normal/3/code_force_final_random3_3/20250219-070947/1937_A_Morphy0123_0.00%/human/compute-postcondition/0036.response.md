Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\).
   - `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\) minus 1.
   - `power` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding `power`:**
   - `power` is defined as the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\) minus 1.
   - This means \(2^{power} \geq n\) and \(2^{(power-1)} < n\).

3. **Calculating \(2^{power}\):**
   - Since `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\), \(2^{power}\) will be the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - This will print the value of \(2^{power}\).

Given the initial state, the value of \(2^{power}\) is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\))**
