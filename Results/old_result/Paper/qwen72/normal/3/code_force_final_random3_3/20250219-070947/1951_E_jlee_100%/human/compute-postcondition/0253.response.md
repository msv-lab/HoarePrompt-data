Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `count` is greater than 0. If `count` is greater than 1 or `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 1 and `count2` is 0, or if `count2` is not greater than `count`, `done` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
