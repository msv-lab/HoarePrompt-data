Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3. If `i` is 3 (which is true in this case), `answer` is a list that now includes the integer `n - 1` at the index `a[-1]` in `array`. If `i` is not 3 (which is false in this case), `answer` now contains the element at index 3 of `array`, and `array[0]` is now `array[0] + 1`.*** 

Since `i` is always 3 in the precondition, the `else` part will never be executed, and the overall postcondition simplifies to:
