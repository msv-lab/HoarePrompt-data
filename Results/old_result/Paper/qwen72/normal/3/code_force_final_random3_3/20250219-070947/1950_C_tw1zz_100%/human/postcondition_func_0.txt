The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of time conversion operations to perform. For each of the `t` operations, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" from the user, where `hh` is the hour and `mm` is the minute. The function then converts the hour part of the time string to a 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" accordingly. The converted time is printed in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" for each input. After all iterations, the function has printed the converted times for `t` inputs, and the state of the program remains as it was before the function call, except for the output produced.
