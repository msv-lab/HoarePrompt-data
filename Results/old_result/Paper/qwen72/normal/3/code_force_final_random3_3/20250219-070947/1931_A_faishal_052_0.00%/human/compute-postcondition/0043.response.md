To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `k` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement uses the `chr` function to convert the value of `arr[k] + 96` to a character.
   - `k` is 2, so `arr[k]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `arr`.
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character. Adding 96 to the integer value of `arr[k]` will shift the integer to the ASCII range for lowercase letters (97 to 122, which correspond to 'a' to 'z').

4. **Determine the Value of `arr[k]`:**
   - Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the element at index 2 (`arr[2]`) is the third smallest element in the list.
   - The exact value of `arr[2]` is not provided, but we know it is an integer.

5. **Calculate the Character:**
   - The value of `arr[2] + 96` will be an integer between 97 and 122, assuming `arr[2]` is a positive integer and within the range of 1 to 26 (since 97 corresponds to 'a' and 122 corresponds to 'z').
   - For example, if `arr[2]` is 1, then `arr[2] + 96` is 97, which corresponds to 'a'.
   - If `arr[2]` is 2, then `arr[2] + 96` is 98, which corresponds to 'b'.
   - And so on.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the character corresponding to `arr[2] + 96`.
   - Since the exact value of `arr[2]` is not provided, we can't determine the exact character, but we know it will be a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.

Output: **[character] (where [character] is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `arr[2] + 96`)**
