Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k]` multiplied by its previous value, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `_` is incremented by 1, and `factors[prime] + 1` must be greater than the new value of `_`. A value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` generates and yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. The variables `k`, `primes`, `rest`, `prime`, `factor`, `prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]`, and `_` remain unchanged, but a value has been yielded.
