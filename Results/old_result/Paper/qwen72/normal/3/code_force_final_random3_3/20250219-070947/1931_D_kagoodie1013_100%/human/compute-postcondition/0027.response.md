The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is undefined, and `arr` is the array part of the second tuple in `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element, and `num` will be the first element of `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
