You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `arr` and then constructs a new list `new_arr` by placing the elements in a mirrored order: starting from the last element and then the first element, followed by the second-to-last element and then the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` will be the last element in `new_arr`. The function returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The function `func_1` sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty. 

Consider the following counterexample:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4

Expected Output:
6

Actual Output:
4
```

In this case, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The program constructs the new array as `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, which results in a beauty of `(4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`. However, the program calculates the beauty as `(4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4`.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty would be to sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, but in reverse order (i.e., the largest difference first). For example, for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the maximum beauty is achieved by the array `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, both of which yield a beauty of 6.
