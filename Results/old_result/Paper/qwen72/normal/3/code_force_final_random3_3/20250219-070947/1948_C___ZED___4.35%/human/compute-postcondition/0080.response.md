Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `k` is `n-1` if `n` is odd or `n` if `n` is even. If `no_path` is False, then `k` is updated to the last odd number less than `n-1` if `n` is odd, or the last odd number less than `n` if `n` is even. Additionally, `no_path` is False if any character at an odd index (from 1 to `k`) in string `a` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains True. If `no_path` is True, the variables retain their initial values.***
