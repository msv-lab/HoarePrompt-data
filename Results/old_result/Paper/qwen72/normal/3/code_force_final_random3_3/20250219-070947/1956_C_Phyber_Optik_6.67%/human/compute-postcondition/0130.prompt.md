Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function does not take any input parameters. The problem description implies that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and has been read from standard input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    sum, r = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
            r = i
            sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
        else:
            sum += i * n
    print(sum, n + r)
    for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
        if j <= n:
            print(1, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        else:
            print(2, j % n, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `j` is `n + r + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is `n + r + 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `n + r + 1`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `sum`, and `r` retain their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
