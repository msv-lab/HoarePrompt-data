Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\), `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is now \(k - 4 \cdot q\), `l` is the binary representation of \(k - 4 \cdot q\) without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the new `l`.**

Explanation:
- `f` is updated to `f - q`, which means `f` is now \(k - 4 \cdot q\).
- `l` is the binary representation of the new `f` value, which is \(k - 4 \cdot q\).
- `p` is the length of the new binary representation of `f`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`) remain unchanged.
