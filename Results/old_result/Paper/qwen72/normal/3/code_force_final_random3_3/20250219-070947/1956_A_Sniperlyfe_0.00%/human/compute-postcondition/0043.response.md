Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 3, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `n` is the third element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended twice.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `_` remains 3.
- The values of `k` and `q` remain as input integers.
- The value of `p` remains a list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `qs` remains a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements.
- The value of `n` remains the third element in `qs`.
- The list `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended twice. The first element in `res` is the result of `func_1(n, p)` from the initial state, and the second element is the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended by the code.
