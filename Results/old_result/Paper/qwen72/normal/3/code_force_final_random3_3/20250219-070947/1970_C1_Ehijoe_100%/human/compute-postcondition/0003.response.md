Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The code initializes `nodes` as a `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory. This means that `nodes` will automatically create a new empty list for any key that is accessed but not yet present in the dictionary. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
