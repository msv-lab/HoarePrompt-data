Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from the input. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function iterates through the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and checks the count of each integer. If it finds two or more unique integers that occur exactly once, or if it finds an integer that does not occur in the list, it returns the first such integer. If no such integer is found, the function does not return a value and the state remains unchanged. **
