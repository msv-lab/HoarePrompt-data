Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than or equal to `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is 0 or less and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 0 or less and `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `count` is incremented by 1 and `done` remains unchanged.***
