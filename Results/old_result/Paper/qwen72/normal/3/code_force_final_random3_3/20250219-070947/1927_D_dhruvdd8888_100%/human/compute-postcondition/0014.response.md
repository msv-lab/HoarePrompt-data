The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`.
- If the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 0, num)`.
- `s` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition `i < N + 1` must be true. Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1. For the loop to continue executing, `N` must be greater than or equal to 0, which is already true.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`, if the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 0, num)`, and `s` is 0**.
