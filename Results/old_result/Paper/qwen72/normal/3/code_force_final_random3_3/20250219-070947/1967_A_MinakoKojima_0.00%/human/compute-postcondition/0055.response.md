To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`.
   - Otherwise, the following steps are executed:
     - `i` is set to `n-1`.
     - For each `i` in the range `n`, `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
     - `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`.
     - `ans` is set to the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the updated list `a`.

3. **Execution of the Code:**
   - First, we need to determine if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`.
     - If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`.
     - If `k < n * m`, then we need to update the list `a` and recalculate `ans` based on the updated list.

4. **Detailed Calculation for `k < n * m`:**
   - For each `i` in the range `n`, `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
     - This means each element in `a` is adjusted to be at least `m` and at most `m + k // n`.
   - After updating `a`, `k` is reduced by the sum of the adjustments made to each element.
   - Finally, `ans` is calculated as the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the updated list `a`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - If `k >= n * m`, the output will be the factorial of `n`.
   - If `k < n * m`, the output will be the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the updated list `a`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output can be described as follows:

- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, the output will be the factorial of `n`.
- If `k` is less than `n * m`, the output will be the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the updated list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is either `math.factorial(n)` if `k >= n * m`, or the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the updated list `a` if `k < n * m`)**
