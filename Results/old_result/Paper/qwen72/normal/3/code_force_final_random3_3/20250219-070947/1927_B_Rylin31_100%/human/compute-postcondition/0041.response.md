Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 1), `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0 except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`, `j` is the second element in `array`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is initially a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
- The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` to the existing `ans`.
- Since `s[j]` is 1, the character appended is the same as the initial character in `ans`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `array`, `j`) remain unchanged.
