Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list containing the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `ans` is increased by `i`. `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.**
