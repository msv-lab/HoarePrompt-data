The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop control variable. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state of the other variables (`YES`, `NO`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `MOD`, `alpha`) does not directly affect the loop's execution, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be a positive integer**
