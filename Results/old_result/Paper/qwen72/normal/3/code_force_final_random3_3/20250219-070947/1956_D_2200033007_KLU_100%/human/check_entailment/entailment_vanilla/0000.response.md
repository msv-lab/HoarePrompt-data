### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array \( a \) of length \( n \) (where \( 1 \le n \le 18 \)).
   - We can perform an operation that replaces a subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) with the MEX of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements after performing the operations.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - For a subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \), the MEX can be calculated by finding the smallest integer from 0 to \( r - l + 1 \) that is not in the subarray.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
   - `func_1` computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) after performing the operations.
   - `func_2` constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function is designed to compute the maximum sum for the subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \).
     - It uses memoization to store results of subproblems in `res_dict`.
     - If the subarray length is 1, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself.
     - It recursively computes the sum by considering different splits of the subarray and the MEX of the subarray.
     - The function does not correctly compute the MEX; it should find the smallest non-negative integer not in the subarray, but it uses a different formula.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
     - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum for the subarray.
     - It then tries to find the optimal split that achieves this sum and recursively constructs the operations for the split subarrays.
     - The function does not correctly handle the MEX calculation, which is crucial for the operations.

   - **`make_stairs`**:
     - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where the elements are \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, i \).
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern.
     - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and applies the MEX operation.
     - The function does not correctly handle the transformation and MEX calculation.

5. **MEX Calculation Error**:
   - The MEX calculation in the program is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the program uses a different formula that does not correctly compute the MEX.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX, which is a fundamental part of the problem.
   - The operations constructed by `func_2` and `make_stairs` are based on the incorrect MEX calculation, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the MEX, which is essential for the problem. Therefore, the operations and the maximum sum calculated by the program are incorrect.
