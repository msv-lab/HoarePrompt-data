Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `t-1`, but this value is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but this value is not directly used in the print statement.
- `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `i` is `n-1`, but this value is not directly used in the print statement.
- `possible` is True because at least one character in `c` is not equal to the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`).

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `possible` do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **YES**
