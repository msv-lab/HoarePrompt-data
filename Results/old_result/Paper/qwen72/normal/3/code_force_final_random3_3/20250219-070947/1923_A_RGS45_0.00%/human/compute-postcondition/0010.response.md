Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

The code snippet `arr = str(input(''))` updates the value of `arr` to a new input string. The other variables remain unchanged, and their conditions and values are still valid. The new value of `arr` will be used to determine the values of `x` and `y` based on the first occurrence of '1' in the original and reversed `arr`, respectively, and `z` will be the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.
