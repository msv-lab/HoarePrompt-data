Output State: **`na_frente` must be at least 1, `v` is 0, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number if `v` is greater than `pos_final`.** 

In natural language: The variable `total` is updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it, where `v` is 0. The variable `na_frente` remains at least 1, and `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number if `v` is greater than `pos_final`.
