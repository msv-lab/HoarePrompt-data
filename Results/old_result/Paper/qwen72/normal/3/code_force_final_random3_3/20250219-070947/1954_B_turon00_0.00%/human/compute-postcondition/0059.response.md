To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`.
   - `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new list `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` and `_` are not directly relevant to the `print(ans)` statement.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `aa` is a set of unique elements from the list `a`.
   - `i` is initialized to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.

3. **Loop and Calculation:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = 0` (decrementing `i`).
   - During the loop, `cnt` is incremented for each element in `a` that is equal to `tmp`.
   - After the loop, `cnt` will hold the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` starting from the end of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the final value of `ans`, which is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and the initial value of `ans` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value between the previous ans and the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the list a at the end of the list a)**
