Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ry = a % y` calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `y` and assigns it to `ry`.
- The initial state variables `test_cases`, `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results`, `freq`, `count`, `arr`, `a`, and `rx` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `ry` is assigned the value `a % y`.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial state variables and the newly assigned value of `ry`.
