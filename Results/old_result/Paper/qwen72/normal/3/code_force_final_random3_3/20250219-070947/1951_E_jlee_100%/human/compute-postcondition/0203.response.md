Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`**: The value of `j` is 0.
2. **String Slicing**:
   - `string[:j - 1]`: This slice starts from the beginning of the string `string` and goes up to the index `j - 1`. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, slicing with a negative index like `string[:-1]` means it will take all elements from the start up to but not including the last element. However, `string[:0 - 1]` is equivalent to `string[:-1]`.
   - `string[j - 1:]`: This slice starts from the index `j - 1` and goes to the end of the string `string`. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, slicing with a negative index like `string[-1:]` means it will take the last element of the string.

### Conclusion:
- `string[:j - 1]` will be an empty string because slicing from the start to -1 (which is the last element) and then excluding it results in no elements.
- `string[j - 1:]` will be the last character of the string `string`.

### Output:
The code will print an empty string followed by the last character of the string `string`.

Output: **'' (empty string), string[-1] (where string[-1] is the last character of the string `string`)**
