To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `l < h`. The state right before the loop indicates that the loop terminates with `l` equal to `h`, which means the loop condition is not met and the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `l` is less than `h`.

Given the state:
- `l` is equal to `h`
- `h` is now `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`

To make the loop execute, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h`. Since `l` and `h` are equal, we need to adjust either `l` or `h` to satisfy the condition `l < h`.

One way to achieve this is to set `l` to a value that is less than `h`. However, since `h` is defined as `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, we need to ensure that `l` is set to a value that is strictly less than this new `h`.

Let's assume `l` is initially set to a value that is one less than `h` to ensure the condition `l < h` is met.

State: **The loop terminates with `l` equal to `h`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is the next element in `F`. `h` is now `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. `l` is now `h - 1`.**
