Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from input, `a` is the second integer from input, `b` is the third integer from input, `_` is 1. If `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds. These conditions apply regardless of whether `n` is odd or even.**
