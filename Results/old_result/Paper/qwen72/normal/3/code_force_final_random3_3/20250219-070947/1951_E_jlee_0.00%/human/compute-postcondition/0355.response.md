Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count`, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `done` is set to True. If `count2` equals `count`, and `count` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 1, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
