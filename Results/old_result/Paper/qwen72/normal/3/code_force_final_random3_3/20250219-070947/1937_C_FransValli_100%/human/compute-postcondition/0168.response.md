The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is `<`, `arr` is `[2]`. If `res` is `=`, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `arr` is `[0, 2]`.**
