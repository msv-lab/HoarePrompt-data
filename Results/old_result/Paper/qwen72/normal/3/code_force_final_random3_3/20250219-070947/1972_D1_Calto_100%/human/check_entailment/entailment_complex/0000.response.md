### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is essential for the problem.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The loop iterates over each `i` from 1 to `m`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then updates `cnt` with the expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The initial value of `cnt` is set to -1, which is incorrect because it should start from 0 to count the valid pairs.

4. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is intended to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b` (or `i` in this context).
   - However, the logic for calculating `x` and `y` and the subsequent expression does not align with the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - For a given `b`, we need to find all `a` such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This means \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\).
   - This implies \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).
   - For each `b`, we need to count the number of `a` values that satisfy this condition.

6. **Function `func_2` Issues:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly count the valid pairs.
   - The initial value of `cnt` should be 0, not -1.
   - The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly handle the GCD condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem. The issues are primarily in the `func_2` function, where the initial value of `cnt` is incorrect and the expression used to count valid pairs does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**False**
