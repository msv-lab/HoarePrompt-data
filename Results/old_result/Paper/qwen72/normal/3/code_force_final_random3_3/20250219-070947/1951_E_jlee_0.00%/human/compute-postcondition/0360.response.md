Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is set to True, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` is greater than `count`. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1, and `done` remains False. If `count` is 0, `done` remains False.***
