Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed in several ways. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Case:**
- Input: `10 10 3 5 8 5`
- Expected Output: `Bob`
- Actual Output: `Draw`

In this case, Alice starts at (3, 5) and Bob starts at (8, 5). Both are on the same column, and the distance between them is 5 rows. Since they are on the same column and the distance is odd, Bob can always move to the same column and intercept Alice on her way down. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" instead of "Bob". This indicates that the program's logic for handling such cases is incorrect.
