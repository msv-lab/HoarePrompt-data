The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `w[0]` incremented by 1 and the element at index `w[1]` incremented by 1, `j` is 2**
