To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed, let's analyze the initial state and the given conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.
   - `count2` is greater than `count`.

2. **Given Conditions:**
   - The current value of `count2` is greater than the current value of `count`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print('YES')` statement.

The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **YES**
