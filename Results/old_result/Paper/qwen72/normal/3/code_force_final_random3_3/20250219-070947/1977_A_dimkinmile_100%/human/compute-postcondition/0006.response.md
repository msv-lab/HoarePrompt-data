The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases, and it is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, if `n` is less than `m`, the function returns "n is less than m" for that test case. If `n` is equal to `m`, it returns "n is equal to m". If `n` is greater than `m`, it returns "n is greater than m".

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). The function returns a list of results, where each result is a string indicating the relationship between `n` and `m` for that test case: "n is less than m", "n is equal to m", or "n is greater than m".**
