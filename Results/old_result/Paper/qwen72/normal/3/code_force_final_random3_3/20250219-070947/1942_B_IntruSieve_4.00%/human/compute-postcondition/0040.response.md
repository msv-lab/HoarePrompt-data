Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the same as the initial `n`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n).
   - `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user.
   - `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
   - `itm` is the second element in `mex`.
   - `minn` is the next integer that has not been added to `mex` or is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used.
   - `maxx` is the maximum value in the `mex` list.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(itm, end=' ')`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The variable `itm` is the second element in the list `mex`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the print statement ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Given the initial state, the value of `itm` is explicitly defined as the second element in the `mex` list. Since `mex` is a list of integers and must have at least two elements, `itm` will be an integer.

Output: **[itm] (where itm is the second element in the `mex` list)**
