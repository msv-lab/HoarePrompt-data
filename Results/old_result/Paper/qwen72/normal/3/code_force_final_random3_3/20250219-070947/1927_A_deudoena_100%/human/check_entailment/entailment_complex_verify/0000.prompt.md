You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B', `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end, `l` is an empty list, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, and `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the start.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the value of `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in the string `s` from the start, and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads two inputs: an integer `m` and a string `s` of length `n` (1 <= n <= 10) consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'. It calculates the distance between the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` and returns this distance plus 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the minimum length of the segment to be painted white when there are multiple black cells in the strip and the first and last black cells are not the only black cells.

For example, consider the test case:
```
6
BWBWWB
```
The correct output should be 4, as the minimum segment to paint is from the 2nd to the 5th cell, making the strip "WWWWWW". However, the provided program will output 6, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1()`. The function only finds the first and last black cells and calculates the segment length based on these two positions. It does not consider the possibility that there might be other black cells in between that would require a shorter segment to be painted.
