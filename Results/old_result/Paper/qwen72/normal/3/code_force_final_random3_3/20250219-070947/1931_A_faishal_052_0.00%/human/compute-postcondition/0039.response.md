Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `cases` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not directly used in the print statement).
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
- `k` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `k`**: The variable `k` is set to 0.
2. **Array `arr`**: The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order. However, the exact values of the elements in `arr` are not provided. We only know that `arr` is sorted and contains some elements.
3. **Accessing `arr[k]`**: Since `k` is 0, `arr[k]` will be the first element of the array `arr`.
4. **Adding 96**: The value of `arr[k]` is added to 96. This is a common technique to convert an integer to its corresponding lowercase letter in ASCII. For example, `chr(1 + 96)` will give `'a'`, `chr(2 + 96)` will give `'b'`, and so on.
5. **`chr` Function**: The `chr` function converts the resulting integer to its corresponding character.
6. **`end` Parameter**: The `end` parameter in the `print` function is set to an empty string, which means that the print statement will not add a newline character at the end. The output will be printed on the same line.

### Conclusion:
Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order and `k` is 0, `arr[k]` will be the smallest element in `arr`. The smallest element in `arr` will be added to 96, and the resulting character will be printed. Without knowing the exact value of `arr[0]`, we can only describe the output in terms of the first element of `arr`.

Output: **chr(arr[0] + 96) (where arr[0] is the first element of the sorted list `arr`)**
