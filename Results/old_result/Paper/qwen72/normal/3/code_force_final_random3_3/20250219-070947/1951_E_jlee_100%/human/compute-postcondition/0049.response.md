The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are directly used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
