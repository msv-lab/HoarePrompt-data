The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by 1 and `x % 3 == 0`, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3)]`. If `x` is divisible by 1 but not divisible by 3, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2)]`. Otherwise, `output1` is a list containing `[2, 3]` and `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2), int(x / 3)]`.**
