Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations. If `k` is 0, `tab` has all its elements printed, and `i` is the last element of `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0. `number` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `number` is assigned the value 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `i`) retain their initial values or conditions.
- The list `tab` still contains the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations.
- If `k` is 0, the elements of `tab` have been printed, and `i` is the last element of `tab`.
- If `k` is not 0, this condition remains unchanged.
- The value of `number` is now 0, which is the only change from the initial state.
