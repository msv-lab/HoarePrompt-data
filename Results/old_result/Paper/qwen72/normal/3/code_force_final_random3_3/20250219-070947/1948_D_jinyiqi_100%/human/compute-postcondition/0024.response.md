Postcondition: ***`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2, `count` is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on whether the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` are met. If none of these conditions are met, `count` is 0.***
