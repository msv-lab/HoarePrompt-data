Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer, and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided, where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function should validate that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5`, and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`. `n` and `q` are now input integers. `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the integers provided by the input. `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**
