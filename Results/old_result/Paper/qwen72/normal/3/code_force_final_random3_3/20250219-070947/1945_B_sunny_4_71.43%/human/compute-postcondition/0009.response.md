Output State: **`a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**

The value of `B` is updated to be `int(m / b) + 1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, `_`, and `A` remain unchanged.
