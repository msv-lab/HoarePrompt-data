Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains the elements [1, 1] and `lex` is reduced by 2. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 52. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains the elements [26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 52.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times because `j` is in the range `range(2)`.
- After the first iteration, depending on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain `[1]` and `lex` will be reduced by 1.
  - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` will contain `[26]` and `lex` will be reduced by 26.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` will contain `[26]` and `lex` will be reduced by 26.
- After the second iteration, depending on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain `[1, 1]` and `lex` will be reduced by 1 again, making the total reduction 2.
  - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` will contain `[26, 26]` and `lex` will be reduced by 26 again, making the total reduction 52.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` will contain `[26, 26]` and `lex` will be reduced by 26 again, making the total reduction 52.
- The variables `cases`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
