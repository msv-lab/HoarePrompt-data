Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0.**

The code snippet `lsum = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to the variable `lsum`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
