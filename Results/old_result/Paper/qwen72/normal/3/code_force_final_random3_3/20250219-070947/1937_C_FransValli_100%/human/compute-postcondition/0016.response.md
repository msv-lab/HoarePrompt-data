Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string, `maxi` is 2**

The value of `res` is updated to the new input string provided by the user. All other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
