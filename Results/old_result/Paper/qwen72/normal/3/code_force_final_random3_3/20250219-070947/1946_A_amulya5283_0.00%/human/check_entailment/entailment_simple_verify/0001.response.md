### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common and efficient technique for handling large inputs.
   - The program then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` from the input data. This is done correctly and efficiently.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `arr.sort()`. This is necessary to find the median, which is defined as the middle element in the sorted array.
   - The sorting step is correct and ensures that the median can be accurately determined.

3. **Finding the Median:**
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array. For an odd length, this will be the exact middle element, and for an even length, this will be the first of the two middle elements.
   - The current median is correctly identified as `arr[median_index]`.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min-heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array. This is done using `heapq.heapify(heap)`.
   - The heap is used to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the current median. This is a good approach because it allows the program to focus on the elements that are most likely to affect the median.

5. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program enters a loop where it increments the smallest element in the heap that is less than or equal to the current median. This is done by popping the smallest element, incrementing it, and pushing it back into the heap.
   - The loop continues until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The number of operations required to achieve this is counted and stored in `operations`.
   - This approach is efficient and ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

6. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are collected in the `results` list and printed one by one.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem's requirements.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
  - `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
  - This state is correctly set up and matches the problem description.

- **State After Function Call:**
  - The loop has completed all its iterations.
  - `results` is a list containing the number of operations required for each test case.
  - `n` is the first element of the last test case in `test_cases`.
  - `arr` is the second element of the last test case in `test_cases` and is now sorted.
  - `median_index` is `n // 2`.
  - `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.
  - `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are now greater than `current_median`.
  - `operations` is the number of times the loop executed for the last test case.
  - This state is consistent with the program's logic and the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the input, sorts the array, identifies the median, and uses a min-heap to efficiently increment the necessary elements to increase the median. The logic and implementation are sound, and the use of a heap ensures that the solution is efficient.
