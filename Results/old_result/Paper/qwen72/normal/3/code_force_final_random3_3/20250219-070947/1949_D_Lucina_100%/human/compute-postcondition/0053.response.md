Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `a[3]` is incremented by 1, `x[0]` is either 'F', 'S', or any other value, `a[1]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `a[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `a` by 1.
- Since `j` is 3, `a[3]` is incremented by 1.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
