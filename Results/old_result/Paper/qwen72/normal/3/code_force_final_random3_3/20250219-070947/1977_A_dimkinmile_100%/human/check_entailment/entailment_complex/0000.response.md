### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`kreker`) from the input.
   - For each test case, the program calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which is appropriate for the problem description.
   - The function checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative using the condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No".

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the number of cubes `m` and that the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
   - This is necessary because:
     - `n - m >= 0` ensures that Nikita has enough moves to build at least `m` cubes.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the remaining moves (after building `m` cubes) can be used to either add or remove cubes in pairs, which doesn't change the total number of cubes in the tower.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - For the first test case (`n = 3`, `m = 3`), the condition `((3 - 3) % 2 == 0 and 3 - 3 >= 0)` is true, so the output is "Yes".
   - For the second test case (`n = 2`, `m = 4`), the condition `((2 - 4) % 2 == 0 and 2 - 4 >= 0)` is false, so the output is "No".
   - For the third test case (`n = 5`, `m = 3`), the condition `((5 - 3) % 2 == 0 and 5 - 3 >= 0)` is true, so the output is "Yes".

5. **Overall Program Structure:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to call `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to read the input and perform the necessary checks, which aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
