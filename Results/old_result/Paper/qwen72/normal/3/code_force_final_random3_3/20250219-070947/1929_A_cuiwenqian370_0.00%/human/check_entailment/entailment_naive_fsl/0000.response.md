Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The function `func_1` sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty. 

Consider the following counterexample:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4

Expected Output:
6

Actual Output:
4
```

In this case, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The program constructs the new array as `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, which results in a beauty of `(4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`. However, the program calculates the beauty as `(4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4`.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty would be to sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, but in reverse order (i.e., the largest difference first). For example, for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the maximum beauty is achieved by the array `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, both of which yield a beauty of 6.
