Output State: **arr is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The length of arr is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, the number of piles n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and the number of stones in each pile a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are such that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. A is False. set_ is a list of unique lists from arr.**

Explanation:
- The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a new list `set_` that contains only the unique inner lists from `arr`.
- The original `arr` remains unchanged.
- The variable `A` remains False.
- The length of `set_` will be less than or equal to the length of `arr`, and it will contain only the distinct inner lists from `arr`.
