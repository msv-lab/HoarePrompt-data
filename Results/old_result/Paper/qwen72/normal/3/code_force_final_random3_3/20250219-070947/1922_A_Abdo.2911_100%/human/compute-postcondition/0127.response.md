Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `possible` is True if any of the following conditions are met during the loop: `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of the input lists `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- The variable `i` is incremented from 0 to `n-1` by the loop.
- The variable `possible` is set to True if, at any iteration:
  - `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`.
  - `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
- If none of these conditions are met during the entire loop, `possible` remains False.
