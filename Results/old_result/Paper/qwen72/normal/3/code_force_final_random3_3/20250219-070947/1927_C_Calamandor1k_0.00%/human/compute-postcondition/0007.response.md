Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is `k // 2`.**

The value of `d` is calculated as the integer division of `k` by 2, resulting in `d` being equal to `k // 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
