The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder used to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. Before the loop starts, the state of `t` is given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

Since `_` is not a variable that needs to be initialized or adjusted before the loop starts, and `t` is already within the required range, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
