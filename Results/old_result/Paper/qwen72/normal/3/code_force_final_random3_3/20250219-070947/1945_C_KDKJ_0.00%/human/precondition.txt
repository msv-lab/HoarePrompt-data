The function `solve` is expected to be called multiple times, each time with a different set of inputs. The inputs for each call are provided through standard input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and the second line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
