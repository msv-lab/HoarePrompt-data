Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is not sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are now greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `arr` are updated to the first and second elements of `test_cases[2]`, respectively.
- `arr` is now the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is not sorted.
- `median_index` is recalculated as `n // 2` based on the new value of `n`.
- `current_median` is updated to `arr[median_index]` based on the new `arr` and `median_index`.
- The `heap` is still a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, but these elements are now greater than `current_median`.
- `i` remains 2.
- `t`, `results`, and `operations` remain unchanged.
