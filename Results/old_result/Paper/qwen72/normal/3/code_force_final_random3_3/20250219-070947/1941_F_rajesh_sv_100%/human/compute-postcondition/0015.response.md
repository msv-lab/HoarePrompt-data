Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and less than or equal to `max_diff`, otherwise `next_max_diff` remains -inf, `index` is 1 if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is None, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`.***
