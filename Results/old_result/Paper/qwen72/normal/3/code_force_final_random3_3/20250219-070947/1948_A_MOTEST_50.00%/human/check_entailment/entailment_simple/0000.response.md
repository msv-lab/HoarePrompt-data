### Reasoning:

1. **Functionality and Inputs**:
   - The function `func()` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading an integer `n` for each test case.

2. **Special Character Condition**:
   - A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The function checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the function constructs a string `ans` that meets the criteria of having exactly `n` special characters.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is even, the function constructs the string by repeating each of the first `n // 2` characters of the uppercase alphabet twice. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, resulting in `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is odd, the function starts with the string 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then appends pairs of characters from the uppercase alphabet, ensuring that the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the function prints 'NO' if `n` is 1, and 'YES' followed by the constructed string if `n` is greater than 1.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by printing 'NO'.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the function ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is a requirement of the problem.

6. **State of the Program**:
   - The comments provided about the state of the program are accurate. After all iterations, `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`, and `n` is the input integer for the last test case. The variables `x`, `ans`, and `j` are correctly updated based on the logic of the function.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases, and the state of the program is accurately described in the comments. Therefore, the program is correct.
