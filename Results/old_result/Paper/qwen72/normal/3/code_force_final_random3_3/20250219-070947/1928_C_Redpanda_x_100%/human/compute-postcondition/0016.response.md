Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and the generator has yielded values `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration from 0 to `factors[prime]`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `prime_to_i` will be equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`. The generator will have yielded a sequence of values, where each value is the product of `factor` and `prime_to_i` at the start of each iteration, ranging from `factor * 1` to `factor * prime ** factors[prime]`. The loop will have run `factors[prime] + 1` times, and the generator will be paused at the end of the loop.
