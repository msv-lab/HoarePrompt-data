The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process multiple test cases, each with specific parameters. For each test case, the function will accept:
- `t`: an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer where \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), representing the length of the lost string.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where \(0 \le a_i < n\), representing the trace of the string.

The function will return a valid string `s` for each trace `a` that corresponds to the given constraints and relationships. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and it is guaranteed that a valid string `s` exists for each trace.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the lost string), and a list `a` of `n` integers (trace of the string). For each test case, it returns a valid string `s` that corresponds to the given trace `a`.**
