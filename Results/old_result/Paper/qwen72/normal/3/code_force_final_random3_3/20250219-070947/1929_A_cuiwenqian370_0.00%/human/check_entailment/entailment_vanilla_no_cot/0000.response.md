Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). The program attempts to rearrange the array by alternating elements from the sorted array's ends, but this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

To maximize the beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array and then pair the largest and smallest elements alternately. However, the program's approach of alternating from the ends of the sorted array does not necessarily achieve this. Instead, the correct approach is to sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    return max_beauty
```

This version sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty.
