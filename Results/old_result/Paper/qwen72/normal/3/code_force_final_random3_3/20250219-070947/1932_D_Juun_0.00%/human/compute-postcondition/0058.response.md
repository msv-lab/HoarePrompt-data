Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `trumps` is an empty list, and `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit, where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order, followed by the suit, and separated by a space.**

Explanation: The code `trumps = sorted(trumps)` sorts the list `trumps`. Since `trumps` is initially an empty list, sorting it has no effect, and it remains an empty list. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
