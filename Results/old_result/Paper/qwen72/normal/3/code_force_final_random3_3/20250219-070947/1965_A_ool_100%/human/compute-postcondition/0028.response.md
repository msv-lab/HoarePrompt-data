The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The length of `arr` is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, the number of piles `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and the number of stones in each pile `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are such that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. 

The function returns 'Alice' in Case_1. In Case_2, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list represents the number of stones in each pile for a test case. It returns 'Alice' if certain conditions are met, or 'Bob' otherwise.**
