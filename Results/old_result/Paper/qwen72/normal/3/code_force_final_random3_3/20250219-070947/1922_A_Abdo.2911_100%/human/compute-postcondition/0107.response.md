Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is set by the loop, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
