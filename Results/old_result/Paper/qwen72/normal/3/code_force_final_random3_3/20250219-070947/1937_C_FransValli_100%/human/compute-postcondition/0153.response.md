Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is `[0]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.**

The code snippet `res = input()` updates the variable `res` to the new input string provided by the user. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
