Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is `n` if `a[0] == tmp` and is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `a[0] != tmp`, `cnt` is 1 if `len(aa) == 1` or if `a[0] == tmp` and `len(aa) != 1`, and is 0 if `a[0] != tmp`.**
