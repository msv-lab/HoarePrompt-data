Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`, `index` is None, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`.** 

The value of `next_max_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`, which is `A[1] - A[0]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
