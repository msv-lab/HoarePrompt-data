Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the greatest value of `gcd_val + y` for any `y` in the range `(x - 1, 0, -1)`, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` that maximizes `max_sum` or `1` if no such `y` exists, and `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `best_y` is appended to the `results` list.
- The `results` list, which was initially empty, now contains the value of `best_y`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
