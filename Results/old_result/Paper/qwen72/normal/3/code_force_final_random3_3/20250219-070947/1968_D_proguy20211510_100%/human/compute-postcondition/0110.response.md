Output State: **`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the integer value `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input value converted to an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integer `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` is now 1, and the element at index `pb - 1` in the `vis` list is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
