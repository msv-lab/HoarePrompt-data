The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute for `j` in the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), which means it will run 2 times regardless of the initial value of `j`. However, for the loop to start and execute its first iteration, `j` must be 0.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `k` is 2, `lex` is an input integer**
