Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. The key to solving this problem lies in the conditions for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be considered beautiful:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

To check these conditions, the program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of the elements in the array when divided by \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, for each element \(a_i\), it calculates:
- \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\)
- \(r_y = a_i \mod y\)

The idea is to use these residues to determine if a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) can satisfy the conditions. For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful:
- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \mod x\) implies \(-a_i \equiv a_j \mod x\), which is equivalent to \(-a_i \mod x = a_j \mod x\).
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \mod y\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \mod y\).

Thus, the program checks if the current element \(a_i\) can form a beautiful pair with any previous element by looking for the key \((r_x, r_y)\) in the `residue_map`. If the key exists, it increments the count by the value associated with that key. Then, it updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

The program correctly processes the input and outputs the results for each test case. The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
