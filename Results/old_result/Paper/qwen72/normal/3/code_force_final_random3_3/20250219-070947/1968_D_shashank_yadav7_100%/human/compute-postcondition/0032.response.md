The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * (k - 2), a[b] * (k - 1) + bp, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k - 2) + sp, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`**
