The `print` statement in the given code snippet is simply printing the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or objects being referenced in the `print` statement itself. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
