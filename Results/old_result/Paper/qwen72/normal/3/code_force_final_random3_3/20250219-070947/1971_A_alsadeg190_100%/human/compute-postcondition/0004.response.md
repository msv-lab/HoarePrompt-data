Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is less than `y`.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y` in the order they are provided. Since `x` and `y` are input integers and `x` is less than `y`, the output will reflect these conditions.

Output: **x, y (where x is an integer less than y and y is an integer greater than x)**
