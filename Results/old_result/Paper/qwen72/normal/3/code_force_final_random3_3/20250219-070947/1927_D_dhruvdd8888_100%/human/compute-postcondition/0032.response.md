Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, where `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means `_` will iterate over a range of positive integers.
2. `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split. For example, if the input is "5 10", then `l` is 5 and `r` is 10.
3. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
4. `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, where `s` is greater than `l` and `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.
- The statement `print(-1, -1)` will always print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, or `e`.

### Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
