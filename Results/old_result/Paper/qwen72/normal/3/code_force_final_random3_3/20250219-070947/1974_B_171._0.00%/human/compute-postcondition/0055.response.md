Output State: **`c` is 97, `mapping` dictionary contains the key-value pair `{'a': char}`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `c` is 97 (which corresponds to the character 'a' in ASCII). The `mapping` dictionary contains the key-value pair `{'a': char}`, where `char` is the third character of the `encoded` string. The loop terminates after the first iteration because it adds the character 'a' to the `mapping` dictionary with the value of `char` and then breaks out of the loop. This is because the condition to add a new key-value pair and break is met on the first iteration, and the loop does not continue further.
