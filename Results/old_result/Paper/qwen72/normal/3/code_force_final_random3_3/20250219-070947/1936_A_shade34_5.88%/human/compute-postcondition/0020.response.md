Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`), and `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**

The code assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the new assignment of `mak2`. If `mak` was 0 (no user input was `<`), `mak2` is also 0. If `mak` was the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is now equal to that value.
