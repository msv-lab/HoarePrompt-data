Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 1 element, `shapes` is the original value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`, and the count of the integer `j` in `palka` (i.e., `d[j]`) is at least 3.**
