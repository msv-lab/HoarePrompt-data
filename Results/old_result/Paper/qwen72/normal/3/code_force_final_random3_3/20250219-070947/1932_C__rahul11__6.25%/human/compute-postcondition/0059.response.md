The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input.
- `i` is `m`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans * n * m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `arr` must be used. Since `i` was `m` in the last iteration, for the next iteration, `i` must be `n`.

State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `n`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n * m`.**
