The only objects in the loop head are variables `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops`. The loop iterates over the tuples in `ops` in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `v1` and `v2` were assigned from the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and `ops` contains at least one tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list must be available, which means `ops` must contain at least two tuples.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `v1` and `v2` will be assigned from the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list, which is the first tuple in the original `ops` list.
- `ops` must still contain at least two tuples for the loop to have executed the previous iteration and to be able to execute again.

State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and possibly `v1` if `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `p2` is a list that may contain `v1` if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `v1` and `v2` are assigned from the first tuple in the original `ops` list, and `p1` or `p2` has `v1` appended to it depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` or not.**
