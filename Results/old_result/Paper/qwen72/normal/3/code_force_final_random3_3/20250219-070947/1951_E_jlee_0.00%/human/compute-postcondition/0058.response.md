Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `count2` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `done` is False.
- `count` is greater than 1, which means that there exists a `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is set to `j`.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `j` and `count`:**
   - `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`.
   - `count` is greater than 1, so `j` is also greater than 1.
   - `count2` is equal to `count`, but it is not used in the print statement.

2. **Understanding the `print` statement:**
   - `string[:j - 1]` will print the substring of `string` from the start up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will print the substring of `string` starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end.

3. **Determine the values:**
   - Since `j` is greater than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, the character at index `j - 1` in `s` is the last character that is equal to `x`.
   - Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` will contain all characters from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will contain the character at index `j - 1` and all subsequent characters in `string`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output two substrings of `string`:
- The first substring is from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`.
- The second substring is from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

Since `j` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, and `s` is derived from `string`, the output will be:
- The first part of the string up to the last occurrence of `x` before the first non-`x` character.
- The rest of the string starting from the first non-`x` character.

Output: **[string[:j - 1]], [string[j - 1:]] (where `j` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, and `x` is the first character of the list `s`)**
