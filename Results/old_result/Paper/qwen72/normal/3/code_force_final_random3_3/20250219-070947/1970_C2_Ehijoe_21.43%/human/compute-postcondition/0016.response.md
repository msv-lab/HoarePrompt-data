Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. Each node in the `nodes` dictionary will have a list of its neighbors, and the number of times each neighbor appears in the list will be equal to the number of times that neighbor was connected to the node during the loop's execution.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` must be greater than 1, as the loop runs `n-1` times.
- The variable `i` will be `n-2`, which is the last value of `i` before the loop exits.
- The `nodes` dictionary will be populated with keys representing the nodes, and each key will have a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. Each neighbor will appear in the list as many times as it was connected to the node during the loop's execution.
