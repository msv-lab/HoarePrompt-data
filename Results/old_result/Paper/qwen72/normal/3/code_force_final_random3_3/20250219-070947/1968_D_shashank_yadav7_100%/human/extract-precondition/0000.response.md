Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined method, not as parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The second line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n representing the permutation, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. The third line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n representing the array, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
