To determine what will be printed when the `print(A + B)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned new integer values from the input.
   - `t` must be greater than 2 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `_` is 2 (though `_` is not used in the print statement).
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

2. **Calculations:**
   - `A` is the integer division of `m` by `a` plus 1.
   - `B` is the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 1.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(A + B)` will print the sum of `A` and `B`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.
- The sum `A + B` will be `int(m / a) + 1 + int(m / b) + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of these two expressions.

Output: **int(m / a) + 1 + int(m / b) + 1 (where `A` is `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`)**
