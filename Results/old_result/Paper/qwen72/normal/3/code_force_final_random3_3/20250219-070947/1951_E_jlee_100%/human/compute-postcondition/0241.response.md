Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `count` is a positive integer.
   - `s` is a string or list of characters (since `s[j]` is being accessed).
   - `x` is a character or string (since it is compared with `s[j]`).
   - `string` is a string (since it is being sliced).

2. **Slicing the String:**
   - `string[:j - 1]` will slice the string from the start up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will slice the string from the character at index `j - 1` to the end.

3. **Given `j` is 1:**
   - `j - 1` is 0.
   - `string[:j - 1]` will be an empty string because it slices from the start to index 0 (exclusive).
   - `string[j - 1:]` will be the entire string starting from index 0, which is the whole string.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Output: **'' [string] (where [string] is the entire string `string`)**
