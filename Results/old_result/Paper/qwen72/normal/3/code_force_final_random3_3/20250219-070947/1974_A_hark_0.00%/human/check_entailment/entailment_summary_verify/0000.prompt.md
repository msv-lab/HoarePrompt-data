You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then calls the function `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `func_2` has been called `t` times, and the program state reflects that the loop has completed `t` iterations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are a large number of 1x1 icons and a few 2x2 icons correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` for calculating the number of screens needed when both `x` and `y` are non-zero is flawed. The program incorrectly subtracts the number of 1x1 icons that could fit in the screens occupied by 2x2 icons, but it does not account for the fact that 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining spaces of the grid after placing the 2x2 icons.

For example, consider the input `x = 15` and `y = 1`. The program calculates:
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1` (1 screen for the 2x2 icon)
- `x = 15 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = 15 - 15 + 4 = 4` (remaining 1x1 icons)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(4 / 15) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (2 additional screens for the 1x1 icons)

The program outputs `3` screens, but the correct output should be `2` screens. This is because the 2x2 icon can be placed on one screen, and the 15 1x1 icons can be placed on the same screen, with the remaining 4 1x1 icons fitting on the second screen.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this input, making it incorrect.
