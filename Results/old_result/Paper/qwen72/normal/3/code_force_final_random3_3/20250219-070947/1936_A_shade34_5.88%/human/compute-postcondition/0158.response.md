Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that is equal to '<', `mak` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`. Therefore, `mak` is now 2. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. If the user input is a string that is equal to '<', `mak` would have been set to 1, but this condition is not affected by the code snippet provided.
