Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two integers `a` and `b` as input, where 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `t` is assigned the value of the user input converted to an integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, and `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If either `a` is even or `b` is even, the program follows the if part. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program follows the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` or `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program executes the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` or `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program executes the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
