Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 22, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 1, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 4. If `lex` is 23, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 27. If `lex` is greater than 23 and less than or equal to 49, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 27. If `lex` is 50, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 52. If `lex` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 74, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 28. If `lex` is 75, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than 75 and less than or equal to 100, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is 101, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 78. If `lex` is greater than 101 and less than or equal to 125, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 29. If `lex` is 126, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than 126 and less than or equal to 150, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is 151, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 78. If `lex` is greater than 151 and less than or equal to 175, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 54. If `lex` is 176, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 79. If `lex` is greater than 176 and less than or equal to 201, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 79. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 202, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 104.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all 4 iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `cases` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` is 1 (since the loop only iterates 2 times, `j` will be 1 at the end of the loop).
- `arr` will contain 4 elements, and the exact values in `arr` and the final value of `lex` depend on the initial value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 22, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 4.
  - If `lex` is 23, `arr` will be `[26, 1, 1, 1]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 27.
  - If `lex` is between 24 and 49, `arr` will be `[1, 26, 1, 1]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 27.
  - If `lex` is 50, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 1, 1]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 52.
  - If `lex` is between 51 and 74, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 26, 1]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 28.
  - If `lex` is 75, `arr` will be `[26, 1, 26, 1]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 53.
  - If `lex` is between 76 and 100, `arr` will be `[1, 26, 26, 1]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 53.
  - If `lex` is 101, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 26, 1]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 78.
  - If `lex` is between 102 and 125, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 1, 26]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 29.
  - If `lex` is 126, `arr` will be `[26, 1, 1, 26]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 53.
  - If `lex` is between 127 and 150, `arr` will be `[1, 26, 1, 26]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 53.
  - If `lex` is 151, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 1, 26]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 78.
  - If `lex` is between 152 and 175, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 26, 26]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 54.
  - If `lex` is 176, `arr` will be `[26, 1, 26, 26]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 79.
  - If `lex` is between 177 and 201, `arr` will be `[1, 26, 26, 26]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 79.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 202, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 26, 26]` and `lex` will be the initial value minus 104.
