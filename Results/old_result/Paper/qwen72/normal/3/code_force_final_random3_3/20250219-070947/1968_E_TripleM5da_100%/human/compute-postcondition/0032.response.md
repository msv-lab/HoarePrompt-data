Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `i` is `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of `n`, which is the final value of the loop counter. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `n` ensures that the loop has run its full course.
