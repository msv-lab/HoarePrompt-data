Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be greater than `x`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, `flag` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains unchanged and the program prints 3.***
