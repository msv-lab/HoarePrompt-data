The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`**
