Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and all `a_i` are distinct.** 

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The variable `ratings` is not affected by this code snippet and retains its initial state. The constraints for `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain valid.
