Output State: **`t` is 0, and the loop has completed all iterations. For each iteration, `n`, `x`, and `y` were input integers, and `arr` was a list of integers of length `x`. The function printed `x - 2` for each test case.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each time. After all iterations, `t` will be 0.
- In each iteration, `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from the input, and `arr` is created as a list of integers of length `x` by converting the first `x` strings from the input.
- The function prints `x - 2` for each test case.
- The state of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` changes with each iteration based on the input provided for that test case, but the overall structure of the loop and the operations within it remain consistent.
