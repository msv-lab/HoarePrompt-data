The function `func_1` accepts parameters `nodes`, `start`, and `parent`. It returns a list of distances from the starting node to all its child nodes in the tree, where each distance is incremented by 1 for each level of depth. If the starting node has no children (or all children are the parent node), the function returns a list containing the single element 0. Otherwise, it returns a list of distances to all child nodes that are not the parent node.
