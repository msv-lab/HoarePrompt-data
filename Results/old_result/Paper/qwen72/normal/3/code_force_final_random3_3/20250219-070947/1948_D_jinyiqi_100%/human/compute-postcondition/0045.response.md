Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step to determine the value of `count` and what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.

2. **Conditions for `count`:**
   - If `s[0]` is '?', `s[j]` is '?', or `s[0]` is equal to `s[j]`, then `count` is 2.
   - If `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - `s[0]` is not '?', `s[j]` is not '?', and `s[0]` is not equal to `s[j]`.
   - Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

Given the conditions:
- `s[0]` is not '?', `s[j]` is not '?', and `s[0]` is not equal to `s[j]`.
- `count` is not equal to `j`.

From the conditions, we can infer:
- The first condition for `count` (where `count` is 2) is not met because `s[0]` is not '?', `s[j]` is not '?', and `s[0]` is not equal to `s[j]`.
- The second condition for `count` (where `count` is 1) is not explicitly stated to be met or not, but since `count` is not equal to `j`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1` which is a non-negative integer, `count` cannot be `j`.

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is:
- `count` is 0.

Now, the print statement is:
```
print(count * 2)
```

Since `count` is 0, `count * 2` is 0 * 2, which is 0.

Output: **0**
