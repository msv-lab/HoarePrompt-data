Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key, `key` is the first key in `nodes`. If the length of the list associated with `key` in `nodes` is 1, `leaves` is a deque containing the first key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.***
