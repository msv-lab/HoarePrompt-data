Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `a` is the second integer from the new input.
- `b` is the third integer from the new input.
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

### Conditions:
- If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.
- If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b + a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `n // 2`**:
   - If `n` is even, `n // 2` is simply `n` divided by 2 (integer division).
   - If `n` is odd, `n // 2` is `n` divided by 2, rounded down to the nearest integer.

2. **Calculate the expression `n // 2 * b + a`**:
   - **If `n` is even**:
     - `n // 2` is `n / 2`.
     - The expression becomes \((n / 2) * b + a\).
   - **If `n` is odd**:
     - `n // 2` is \((n - 1) / 2\).
     - The expression becomes \(((n - 1) / 2) * b + a\).

### Final Output:
- The print statement will output the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`.
- The value of `n // 2` depends on whether `n` is even or odd, but the final output will always be an integer because `n // 2` is an integer and `b` and `a` are integers.

Output: **((n // 2) * b + a) (where n is the first integer from the new input, a is the second integer from the new input, and b is the third integer from the new input)**
