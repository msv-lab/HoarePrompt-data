Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sb` is now [1, 2, 3].**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` was [1, 2] if `a[i]` and `b[i]` were both 0 in the previous iteration, otherwise `sb` remained unchanged. After appending `i`, `sb` is now [1, 2, 3]. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
