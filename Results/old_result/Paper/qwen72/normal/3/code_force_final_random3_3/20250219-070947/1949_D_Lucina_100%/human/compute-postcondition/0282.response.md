Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[3][0]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the string containing the character at the position `xx[3][0]` followed by the character at the position `xx[3][1]`. If `xx[3][0]` is equal to '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'SS'. Otherwise, if `xx[3][0]` is equal to '?', `nx` is 'FF'. If `xx[3][0]` is not equal to '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is the string containing the character at the position `xx[3][0]` followed by 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is the string containing the character at the position `xx[3][0]` followed by 'F'.***
