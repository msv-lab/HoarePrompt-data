### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for determining the number of winners for a given number of players `n` and a sequence of positions `p` to be removed.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, it reduces `n` by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This is done using a generator expression `(1 for x in p if x <= n)` which counts the number of valid positions to remove.
   - Once the loop exits, it returns the remaining number of players, which is the number of winners.
   - This implementation accurately follows the problem description and correctly handles the removal of players based on the sequence `p`.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, where `k` is the length of the sequence `p` and `q` is the number of different initial player counts to consider.
   - It then reads the sequence `p` and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - The `print` statement inside the loop that processes each initial player count `n` is indeed incorrect. It should be outside the loop, after all results for the current test case have been computed.
   - The current placement of the `print` statement will print partial results for each `n` in `qs`, which is not the desired behavior.

### Corrected Function 2:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Conclusion:
- The logic of `func_1` is correct and handles the problem as described.
- The logic of `func_2` is mostly correct, but the placement of the `print` statement is incorrect, which affects the output format.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program needs the `print` statement to be moved outside the inner loop to correctly print the results for each test case. This is a critical issue that affects the correctness of the program's output.
