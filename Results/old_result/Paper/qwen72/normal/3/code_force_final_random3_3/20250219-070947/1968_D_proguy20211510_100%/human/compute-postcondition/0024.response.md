Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1`, which is 1, and `pb` is now equal to `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
- The previous value of `pb` was `p[pb - 1]`, and now it is `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`) remain unchanged.
