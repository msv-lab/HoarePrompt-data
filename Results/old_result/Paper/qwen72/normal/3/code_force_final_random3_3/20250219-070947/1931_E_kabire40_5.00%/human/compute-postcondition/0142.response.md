Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together, and then concatenated with the reversed value of `val_in`, `val_in` is the second element in `rev_val`. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string, and must have at least 2 elements.**
