### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the highest non-trump card for each suit.
   - It also uses a list `trumps` to store all the trump cards.

3. **Card Processing**:
   - For each card, it checks if the card is a trump card and adds it to the `trumps` list if it is.
   - If the card is not a trump card and the suit already has a card in the `suits` dictionary, it creates a pair of cards where the current card beats the stored card and appends this pair to the `answers` list. It then removes the stored card from the dictionary.
   - If the card is not a trump card and the suit does not have a card in the `suits` dictionary, it stores the card in the dictionary.

4. **Handling Remaining Cards**:
   - After processing all cards, it checks if there are any remaining non-trump cards in the `suits` dictionary.
   - If there are remaining non-trump cards and there are trump cards available, it pairs the remaining non-trump card with a trump card and appends this pair to the `answers` list.
   - If there are remaining non-trump cards and no trump cards are available, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.

5. **Output**:
   - The program sorts the remaining trump cards and pairs them with each other, printing the pairs.
   - It then prints all the pairs stored in the `answers` list.

### Issues:
- **Function Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will cause a `NameError` in Python. The function should be defined before it is called.
- **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of rounds `n` but does not use it in the logic. This is not a correctness issue but a potential optimization opportunity.
- **Card Pairing Logic**: The logic for pairing non-trump cards and trump cards is sound, but it could be more clearly structured for better readability.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for pairing cards and handling trump cards is generally correct.
- However, the function call order issue will cause the program to fail when run.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has a critical issue with the function call order, which will prevent it from running correctly. Fixing this issue will make the program correct.
