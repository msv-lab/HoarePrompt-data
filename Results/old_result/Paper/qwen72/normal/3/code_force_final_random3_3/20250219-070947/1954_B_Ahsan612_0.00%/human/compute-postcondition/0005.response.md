Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `minn` is infinity.**

The code initializes the variable `minn` to infinity. No other variables are affected, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
