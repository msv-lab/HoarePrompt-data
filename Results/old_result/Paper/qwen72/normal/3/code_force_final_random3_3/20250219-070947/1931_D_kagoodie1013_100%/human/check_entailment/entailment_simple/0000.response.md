Reasoning:

The program reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes it to create a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing the values `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`. The function `func_1` is then called with this list of test cases, and it processes each test case to find the number of beautiful pairs.

### Key Points in the Program:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` from the list of strings.
   - This part of the program is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a `count` variable to 0, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.

3. **Finding Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates two residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x` (residue of `-num` modulo `x`).
     - `r_y = num % y` (residue of `num` modulo `y`).
   - It then checks if the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` is already in the `residue_map`. If it is, it adds the count of this tuple to `count` because it means there are elements in the array that, when paired with `num`, form a beautiful pair.
   - After checking, it updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, which is a list of integers representing the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Residue Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is correct because it ensures that the sum of two numbers is divisible by `x` if their residues sum to 0 modulo `x`.
  - The calculation of `r_y` as `num % y` is correct because it ensures that the difference of two numbers is divisible by `y` if their residues are the same modulo `y`.

- **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
  - The program correctly uses the `residue_map` to count the number of pairs that satisfy both conditions.
  - The `residue_map` is reset for each test case, ensuring that the counts are independent for each test case.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program processes each test case in O(n) time, where n is the length of the array. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The input parsing, residue calculation, and counting of pairs are all done correctly, and the program handles the constraints efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
