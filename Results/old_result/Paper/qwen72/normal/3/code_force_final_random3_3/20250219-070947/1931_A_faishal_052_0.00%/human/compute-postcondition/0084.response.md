The only objects in the loop head are `k` and the range defined as `range(3)`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 0 to 2 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be within the range of 0 to 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2]. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]**
