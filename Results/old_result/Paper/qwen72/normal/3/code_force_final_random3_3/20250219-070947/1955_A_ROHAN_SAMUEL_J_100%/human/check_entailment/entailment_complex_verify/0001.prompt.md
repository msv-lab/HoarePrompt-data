You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The loop variable `_` is equal to `t - 1`. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input, where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the following rules: If `n` is odd, it prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even, it prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. This is appropriate for the problem description.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, it prints the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price).

4. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, it prints the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 (odd) and the promotion price is not used.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 2 (even) and the promotion price is used if it is cheaper.

6. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is correct. It considers both the regular and promotion prices and chooses the cheaper option for pairs of yogurts.
   - For odd `n`, it ensures that the last yogurt is bought at the regular price if the promotion price is not cheaper for a pair.
   - For even `n`, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price if it is cheaper.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
