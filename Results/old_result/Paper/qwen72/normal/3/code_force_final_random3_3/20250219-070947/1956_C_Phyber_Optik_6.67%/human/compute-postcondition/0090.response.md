The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 1.

Given the initial state, `n` is already a new input integer greater than 0, which ensures that the loop can execute. However, `i` is currently set to `n`, which is not the correct starting value for the loop. The loop requires `i` to start at 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` starts at 1, and `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0**
