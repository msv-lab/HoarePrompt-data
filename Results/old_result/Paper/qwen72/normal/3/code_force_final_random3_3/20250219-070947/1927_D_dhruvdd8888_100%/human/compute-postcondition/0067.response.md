Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers from the input split.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - If `s > l`, the postcondition remains unchanged.
   - If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and variables, but none of these conditions or variables affect the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print `-1, -1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output `-1, -1` regardless of the values of `s`, `l`, `eli`, `LA`, or any other variables in the initial state.

Output: **-1, -1**
