Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 0, `l` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of length `t` where each element at index `j` (for each `j` in `array`) is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array` in the order they appear in `array`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `l` remains equal to `t`.
- The list `s` has been modified such that for each index `j` in `array`, the element at that index in `s` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`.
- The list `array` remains unchanged.
- The string `ans` contains characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`. Each character in `ans` is determined by the value of `s[j]` at the time it is added to `ans`.
