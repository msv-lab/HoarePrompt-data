Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is `n`, `cnt` is 0 if `len(aa) == 1` and remains unchanged if `len(aa) != 1`, and the first element of `a` (`a[0]`) is not equal to `tmp`***
