Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i - 1 <= n - start_index, `j` is `start_index + i + 1`, `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all equal to `i`, `res` includes `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `i` remains the same as it was initially.
- The value of `j` is now `start_index + i + 1`, which is the index just after the last element modified by the loop.
- The elements in the list `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) are all set to `i`.
- The list `res` still includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, representing the range of indices that were modified.
- The variable `is_already_stairs` remains `False`.
- The condition that `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1` still holds true.
