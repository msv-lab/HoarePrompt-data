Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, and `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]`, depending on whether `(-1) ** i` is -1. If `(-1) ** i` is -1, `a` is a list containing either the integers 1 and -3 or the integers 2 and -2, depending on whether `(-1)` was in `a`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing either the integers 2 and -2 or the integers 3 and -1, depending on whether `(-1)` is in `a`.***
