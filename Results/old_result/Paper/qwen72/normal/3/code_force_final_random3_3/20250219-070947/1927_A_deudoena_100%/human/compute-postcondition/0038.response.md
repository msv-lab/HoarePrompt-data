Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B', `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end, `l` is an empty list, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, and `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the start.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the string `s` in reverse order.
- The variable `d` keeps track of the number of iterations.
- When the loop encounters the first 'B' (from the end of the string), it sets `ma` to the position of this 'B' from the start of the string and breaks out of the loop.
- The position of the last 'B' from the start of the string is `len(s) - d`, where `d` is the number of iterations when the 'B' is found.
- The loop will stop as soon as it finds the first 'B' from the end, so `d` will be the position of this 'B' from the end of the string.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `m`, `c`, `l`, `mi`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
