Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then iterates over each test case. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is also correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct for identifying a stair.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is correct for identifying a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, the program prints "NONE". This is correct as per the problem description.

4. **Output**:
   - For a stair, the program prints "STAIRS". However, the problem description specifies that the output should be "STAIR" (without the 'S'). This is a minor issue but it affects the correctness of the program.
   - For a peak, the program prints "PEAK", which is correct.
   - For neither, the program prints "NONE", which is correct.

Given the above points, the program is almost correct but has a small issue with the output for the "STAIR" case.

Correctness: **False**
