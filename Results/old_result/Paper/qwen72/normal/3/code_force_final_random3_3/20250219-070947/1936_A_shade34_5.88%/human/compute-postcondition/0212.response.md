Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `mak` is 1 if the user input is not `>`, otherwise `mak` is 2.
   - `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution.
   - `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution and must have at least 4 elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The print statement starts with the string `'?'`.
   - `pans[mak]` is the element in the list `pans` at the index `mak`.
   - `pans[mak]` is repeated twice.
   - `pans[i]` is the element in the list `pans` at the index `i`.
   - `pans[i]` is repeated twice.
   - `i` is 3, so `pans[i]` is `pans[3]`.

4. **Determining the Values:**
   - `mak` can be either 1 or 2, depending on the user input.
   - `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements, and the elements are indices where the user input was `=` or `<`.
   - `pans[mak]` will be either `pans[1]` or `pans[2]` based on the value of `mak`.
   - `pans[3]` is the fourth element in the list `pans`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `pans[mak]` repeated twice, and then the value of `pans[3]` repeated twice.
   - Since `mak` can be either 1 or 2, the output will depend on the user input.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where [pans[mak]] is the element at index 1 or 2 in the list `pans` based on the user input, and [pans[3]] is the element at index 3 in the list `pans`)**
