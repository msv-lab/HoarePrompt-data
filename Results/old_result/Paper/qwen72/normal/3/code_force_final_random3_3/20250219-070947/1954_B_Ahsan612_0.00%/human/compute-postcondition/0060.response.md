Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. If `ar[1] == num`, then `i` is 3, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is set to `inf`, and `same` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1. After the code `num = ar[i]` is executed, `num` is now the element at index `i` in the list `ar`.**

To break it down:
- If `ar[1] == num`, then `i` is 3, and `num` was the first element of `ar`. After the code `num = ar[i]` is executed, `num` is now the element at index 3 in the list `ar`.
- Otherwise, `i` is 4, and `num` was the third element of `ar`. After the code `num = ar[i]` is executed, `num` is now the element at index 4 in the list `ar`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `minn`, and `same` remain unchanged.
