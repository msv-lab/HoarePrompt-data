You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()

        n = len(s)
        done = False
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')

        x = s[0]

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` and a list of `t` strings from the input. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the string are different. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of substrings (1 or 2) and the substrings themselves. If the string cannot be split in this manner, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` strings, the function concludes, and the final state of the program includes the input variables `t` and `string` as they were last read, and the internal variables `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, and `done` as they were last modified during the processing of the last string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly partition strings that have a single character repeated multiple times with one different character in the middle. For example, consider the input string "aabbccdd". The program will output "NO" for this string, but it should output "YES" with a valid partition such as "aab bccdd".

Let's break down the issue:
- The program checks if the first and last characters are different. If they are, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
- If the first and last characters are the same, it checks if all characters are the same. If they are, it prints "NO".
- If all but one character are the same, it checks if the middle character is different. If it is, it prints "NO".
- If none of the above conditions are met, it tries to find a partition where the first and last characters are different.

However, the logic for handling cases where the string has a pattern like "aabbccdd" is flawed. The program does not correctly identify that such a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For instance, "aabbccdd" can be partitioned into "aab" and "bccdd", but the program will incorrectly output "NO".
