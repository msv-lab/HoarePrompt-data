Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 28, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. The list `s` will have been modified such that any consecutive '1's will be replaced with '-1' and '1' respectively, and any '0' that follows a '-1' will be set to '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s` is a list containing 31 strings, where `s[29]` is '0' and `s[30]` is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `length` remains 30, and `s[29]` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings, modified as described, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`. If the second element of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`) is '-1' and the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '1', then the second element of `s` is set to '0', and the first element of `s` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[2]` is modified to '-1'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 3, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`. If the element at index 3 in the list `s` is '-1' and the element at index 2 is '1', the element at index 3 remains '-1'. Otherwise, the element at index 3 is not '-1' or the element at index 2 is not '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
