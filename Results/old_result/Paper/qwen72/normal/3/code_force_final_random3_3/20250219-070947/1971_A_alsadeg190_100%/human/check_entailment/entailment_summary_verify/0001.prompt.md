You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `x` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9) from the user. It then prints the two integers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined to handle the problem.
   - The first input is read as an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - A loop is then set up to run `x` times, each time reading a pair of integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - Inside the loop, the input is split by spaces and converted to a list of integers.
   - The variables `x` and `y` are then assigned the values from this list.

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program checks if `x` is less than `y`.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are equal, as it will print the same number twice, which is correct.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are within the valid range (0 to 9).

5. **Input and Output Format:**
   - The input format is correctly handled, with the number of test cases read first and then each test case read in the loop.
   - The output format is correct, printing two integers per test case, with the minimum followed by the maximum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case and prints them in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
