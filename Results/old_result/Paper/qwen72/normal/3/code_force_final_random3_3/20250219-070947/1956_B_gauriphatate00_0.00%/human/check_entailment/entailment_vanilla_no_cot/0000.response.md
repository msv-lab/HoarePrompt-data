Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution for the described card game problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - **Input:** `n` (the number of cards each player receives) and `a` (the list of integers on the cards in your hand).
   - **Process:**
     - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
     - It calculates the number of pairs of cards you have by summing up the counts where the count is exactly 2.
     - It returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` (since you can only score points if Nene has already played a card with the same number, and you can only play up to `n // 2` pairs).
   - **Output:** The maximum number of points you can get.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - **Input:** Reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - **Process:**
     - It initializes the index `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a` from the input data.
     - It calls `func_1` with `n` and `a` to get the result for the current test case and appends it to the `results` list.
   - **Output:** Prints the results for all test cases.

The logic in `func_1` is correct because:
- The number of pairs you can form is the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
- Since Nene plays optimally, she will always play a card with a number that you don't have a pair for, or if you have a pair, she will play it after you to maximize her score.
- Therefore, the maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2`.

The logic in `func_2` is also correct:
- It reads the input efficiently and processes each test case correctly.
- It uses the result from `func_1` for each test case and prints the results in the correct format.

Thus, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
