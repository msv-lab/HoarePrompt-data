You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` ≤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function populates an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` with specific values. After the function concludes, `arr` contains a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific pattern: the first half of the range from `left` to `left + mid - 1` is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half from `left + mid` to `right` is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1` and moving backwards. The `cliquess` array is filled with the value of `clique` for all indices from `left` to `right`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` in place.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We need to create a graph where an edge exists between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`**
     - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.
     - It iterates over the range of `cliques` and calls `make_array` for each clique.
     - Finally, it prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.

   - **Function 2: `make_array(left, right, clique)`**
     - This function is responsible for assigning values to the vertices within a specific range.
     - It calculates the number of small elements and big elements to be assigned.
     - It assigns the small elements from `left` to `left + mid - 1` and the big elements from `left + mid` to `right`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Clique Calculation:**
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This is correct because each clique can have at most `k` vertices.
   - **Value Assignment:**
     - The function `make_array` assigns values to the vertices in a way that ensures the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is met.
     - It assigns small elements in increasing order and big elements in decreasing order within the range.
   - **Clique Assignment:**
     - The function `make_array` also assigns the same clique number to all vertices within the range, which is correct for forming a clique.

4. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - **Single Clique:**
     - If \(k \ge n\), the entire graph can be a single clique. The program handles this by assigning all vertices to the same clique.
   - **Multiple Cliques:**
     - If \(k < n\), the program divides the vertices into multiple cliques, each of size at most `k`. This is correct as it ensures the minimum number of cliques.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.
   - The assigned values are distinct and within the range [1, n].
   - The number of cliques is correct.
   - The clique assignments ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly assigns values to the vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem description. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program should work for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
