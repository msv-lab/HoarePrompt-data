To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

1. **`results`**: This variable is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be an iterable with at least one element. The state of `results` is dependent on the function `func_1` and the input `test_cases`.

2. **`result`**: This variable will take on the values from `results` during each iteration of the loop. We do not need to adjust `result` directly, but we need to ensure that `results` has elements to assign to `result`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `idx` is 7 + 2 * (t - 3).
- `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.

To ensure the loop executes, `results` must be an iterable with at least one element. Since `results` is derived from `test_cases` and `test_cases` contains `t` tuples, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 and `func_1` returns a non-empty iterable.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `test_cases` must be a list containing at least one tuple.
- `results` must be an iterable with at least one element.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an iterable with at least one element**.
