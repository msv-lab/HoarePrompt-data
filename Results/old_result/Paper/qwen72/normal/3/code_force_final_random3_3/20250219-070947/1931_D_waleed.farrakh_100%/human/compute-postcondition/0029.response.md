The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads from standard input, expecting a specific format where the first line is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it expects two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `arr`.

The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints, so the exact return value is not specified.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `arr`. It processes each test case and returns the results for all test cases.**
