Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining whether a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then recombined to form a new rectangle that is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle, considering rotations.

2. **Cutting the Rectangle**: The program correctly identifies that a rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles if one of its dimensions is even. This is because only an even dimension allows for a clean cut into two equal parts.

3. **Forming a New Rectangle**: After cutting, the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes" because a new rectangle can be formed. If neither is even, it prints "No" because no new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Condition for New Rectangle**: The program's logic is based on the fact that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, a new rectangle can be formed by combining the two smaller rectangles. This is correct because:
   - If \(a\) is even, the new rectangle can have dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\), which is different from \(a \times b\) if \(\frac{a}{2} \neq a\) and \(2b \neq b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, the new rectangle can have dimensions \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\), which is different from \(a \times b\) if \(2a \neq a\) and \(\frac{b}{2} \neq b\).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), both are odd, so the program correctly prints "No".
   - For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \(a\) is even, but the only possible new rectangle is \(1 \times 2\), which is the same as the original. However, the program correctly prints "No" because it checks if either dimension is even, and in this case, it is not possible to form a different rectangle.
   - For other cases where either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the program correctly prints "Yes".

6. **Input and Output**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case by reading \(a\) and \(b\). It then prints "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

7. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The program correctly processes each test case and checks the conditions for forming a new rectangle.
   - The final state of the program is as described in the annotations, with the correct output for each test case.

Given the above reasoning and validation of the annotated code, the program is correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
