Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers. For each iteration from 0 to `t-1`, if `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds and 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds and 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds and 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the loop has run `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. The loop variable `i` has reached the value `t-1`, which is the last index of the loop. For each iteration, the loop received three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, and based on the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c`, it printed 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' respectively. The final state of the loop is that all `t` iterations have been executed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each set of input integers.
