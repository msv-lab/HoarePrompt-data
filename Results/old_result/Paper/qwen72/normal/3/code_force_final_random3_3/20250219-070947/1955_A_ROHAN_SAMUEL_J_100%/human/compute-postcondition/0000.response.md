The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0. The state of `t` and the conditions for `n`, `a`, and `b` do not directly affect the loop head, but they are part of the initial state and should be included in the final state description.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is 0**
