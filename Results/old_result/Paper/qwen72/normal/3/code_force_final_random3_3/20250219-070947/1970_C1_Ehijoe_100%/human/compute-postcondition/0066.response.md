The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, it is designed to be used in a context where specific inputs are provided in a predefined format. These inputs include two integers n and t, where n is the number of nodes in a tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) and t is always 1. The next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree. The last line contains a single integer u (1 ≤ u ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round.

The function returns a result based on the provided inputs, but the specific output is not clearly defined in the problem description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the tree structure and the starting node, and return a result based on this processing.

Functionality: **The function processes a tree structure defined by a series of edges and a starting node, and returns a result based on this processing.**
