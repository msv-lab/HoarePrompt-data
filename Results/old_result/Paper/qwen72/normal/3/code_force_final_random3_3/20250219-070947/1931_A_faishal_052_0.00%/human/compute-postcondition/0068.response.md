Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the element 1 and `lex` is reduced by 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26, and `lex` is reduced by 26.***
