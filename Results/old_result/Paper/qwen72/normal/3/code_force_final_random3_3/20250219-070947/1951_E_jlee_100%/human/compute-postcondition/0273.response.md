Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is greater than or equal to 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `count2` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
- Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, `done` remains unchanged and `count2` is not modified.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state describes conditions and variable modifications that occur within a loop, but it does not affect the `print('YES')` statement directly.
- The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
