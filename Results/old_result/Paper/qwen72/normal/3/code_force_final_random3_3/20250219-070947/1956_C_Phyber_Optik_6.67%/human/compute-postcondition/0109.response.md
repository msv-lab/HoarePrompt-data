To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is the loop iterator. Before the loop starts, it is not explicitly initialized, but the loop will initialize it to 1 on the first iteration.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable is used to define the range of the loop. It must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.
3. **Variable `r`**: This variable is used to extend the range of the loop. It must be a non-negative integer. If `r` is 0, the loop will still execute if `n` is positive.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is not explicitly initialized (but will be set to 1 by the loop).
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `sum` is calculated based on the conditions involving `n` and `r`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or remains 0 if no such `i` exists.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `r` must be a non-negative integer.

Since `j` is initialized by the loop, we don't need to adjust it. We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `r` is a non-negative integer.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `r` must be a non-negative integer**
