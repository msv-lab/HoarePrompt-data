Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The values of `k` and `q` remain as input integers.
- The value of `p` remains a list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `qs` remains a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element.
- The value of `n` remains the first element in `qs`.
- The value of `res` is now a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
