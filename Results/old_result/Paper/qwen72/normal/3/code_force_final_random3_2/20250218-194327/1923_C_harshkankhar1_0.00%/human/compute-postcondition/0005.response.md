Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 1, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`.**

The value of `b[1]` is updated to be the value of `b[0]` plus `x`. The value of `x` is determined by the condition that if `a[1]` is greater than 1, `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
