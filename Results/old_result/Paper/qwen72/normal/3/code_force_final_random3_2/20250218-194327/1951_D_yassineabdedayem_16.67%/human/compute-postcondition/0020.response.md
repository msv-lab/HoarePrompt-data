Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` after being updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `Min`, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation:
- `number` is updated to be equal to `Min`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions (`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` after being updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `tab` contains the string representation of `number`, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`) are still valid.
