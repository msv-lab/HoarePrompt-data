The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `palka`. For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `palka` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary**
