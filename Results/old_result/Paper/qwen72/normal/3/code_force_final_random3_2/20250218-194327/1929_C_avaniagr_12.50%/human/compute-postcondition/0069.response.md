Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `z` is 1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- The initial value of `z` is `1 + (1 // (k - 1))`.
- The new value of `z` is `1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `_`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
