Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is now `inf`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it would be updated to 1. However, the code snippet `minn = inf` explicitly sets `minn` to `inf`, overriding any previous value.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, and `same`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
