Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
2. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
3. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
4. `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
5. `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
6. The value of `s` is greater than `l`.
7. `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
- The initial state provides conditions and values for `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, and `e`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement because the `print` statement is hardcoded to print `-1` and `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print `-1` and `-1` regardless of the initial state conditions.

Output: **-1, -1**
