Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes in a tower after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is based on the observation that the number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must satisfy the condition that the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even number. This condition is correct because:

1. **Non-negative Difference**: The difference `n - m` must be non-negative because `n` represents the total number of moves, and `m` represents the final number of cubes. If `n < m`, it means Nikita would need to add more cubes than the total number of moves, which is impossible.
2. **Even Difference**: The difference `n - m` must be even because each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. If the difference is odd, it means that after `n` moves, the number of cubes added and removed cannot balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes.

However, the program has a logical flaw in the condition it checks. Specifically, the condition `if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not entirely correct. The correct condition should be:

- **`n >= m`**: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the final number of cubes.
- **`n % 2 == m % 2`**: This ensures that `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). This is because the number of moves and the final number of cubes must have the same parity for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

Let's correct the condition in the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and n % 2 == m % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Now, let's verify the corrected program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is `3 >= 3` which is `True`.
   - `n % 2 == m % 2` is `3 % 2 == 3 % 2` which is `1 == 1` which is `True`.
   - Output: `Yes` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n >= m` is `2 >= 4` which is `False`.
   - Output: `No` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is `5 >= 3` which is `True`.
   - `n % 2 == m % 2` is `5 % 2 == 3 % 2` which is `1 == 1` which is `True`.
   - Output: `Yes` (Correct)

Given the corrected condition, the program now correctly handles all the test cases.

Correctness: **False** (The original program has a logical flaw in the condition it checks, which has been corrected in the reasoning above.)
