Output State: **`b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[-1]` which is 1 and `b[x]` which is 1 if `x` is 25, otherwise `b[x]` is 1 and `b[-1]` remains 1; `t` is 2; `n` is an input integer greater than 2; `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive); `i` is the third integer in the new `s`; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`; `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in the list `a` (if `x` is 25, `r` will be `a[25]` appended to the previous value of `r`; if `x` is -1, `r` will remain the same because `a[-1]` is out of bounds and will not be appended).**
