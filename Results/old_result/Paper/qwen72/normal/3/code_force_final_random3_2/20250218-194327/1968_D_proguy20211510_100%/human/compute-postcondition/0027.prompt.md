Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integer `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the current value of `vis[pb - 1]` remains 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now equal to `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]` and the new value `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the current value of `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` remains 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now equal to `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[pb - 1]`, and the new value `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the current value of `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` remains 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
