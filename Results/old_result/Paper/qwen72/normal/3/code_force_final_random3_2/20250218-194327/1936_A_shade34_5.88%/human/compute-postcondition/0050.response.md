Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `s` is not '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1, 2]` if `s` is either '<' or '='.**
