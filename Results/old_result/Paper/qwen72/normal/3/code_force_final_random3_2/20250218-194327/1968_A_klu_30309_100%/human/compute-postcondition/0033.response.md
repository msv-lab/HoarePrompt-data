Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 1)`**.
