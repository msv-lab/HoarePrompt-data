Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x` as its last element and the new input string `x` as its last element, `i` is `n`, and `x` is the new input string. The values at indices 1 through `n` in the list `a` are incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'F' at the corresponding position in `x`, and the values at indices 1 through `n` in the list `b` are incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'S' at the corresponding position in `x`.**
