Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, where the second element is `'-1'` and the rest represent the bit at the corresponding position of the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit). `flag` is 1.**

The code snippet `flag = 1` sets the variable `flag` to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
