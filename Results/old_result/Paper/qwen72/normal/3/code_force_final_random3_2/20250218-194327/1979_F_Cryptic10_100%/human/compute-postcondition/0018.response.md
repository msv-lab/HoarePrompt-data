Output State: **`v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, and `_` is the second value returned by `q(0)`. The values of `int(input())`, `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, and `ops` remain unchanged, except that `v3` is removed from `vx`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v3` removed, and `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` removed, and `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`.**
