Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 2. This means the user input is an integer greater than 2.
   - `l` and `r` are updated with new integers provided by the user input.
   - `tc` is greater than 5.
   - `ppp` is 23.
   - `s` is less than or equal to the new `l`.
   - `e` is greater than or equal to the new `r`.
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(new l, 0, 0)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is very straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement will always print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `tc`, `ppp`, or `eli`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement will be `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
