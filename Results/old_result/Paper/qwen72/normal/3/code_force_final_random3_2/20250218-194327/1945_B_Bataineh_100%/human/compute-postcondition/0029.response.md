To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 + m // a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are new input integers.
- The relationship between `m`, `a`, and `b` is described as follows:
  - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `m` is less than both `a` and `b`.
  - If `m` is between `a` and `b`, then `m` is between `a` and `b`.
  - If `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `b`, then `m` is either less than or equal to `a` or greater than or equal to `b`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
- `2 + m // a`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `m // a`**:
   - The expression `m // a` performs integer division, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division of `m` by `a`.
   - The value of `m // a` depends on the values of `m` and `a`.

2. **Possible Values of `m` and `a`**:
   - If `m` is less than `a`, then `m // a` will be 0 because `m` is not large enough to be divided by `a` even once.
   - If `m` is between `a` and `b`, then `m // a` will be 1 because `m` is at least as large as `a` but less than `2 * a`.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `b`, then `m // a` will be at least 1, and possibly larger depending on the exact values of `m` and `a`.

3. **Calculating `2 + m // a`**:
   - If `m` is less than `a`, then `m // a` is 0, so `2 + m // a` is \(2 + 0 = 2\).
   - If `m` is between `a` and `b`, then `m // a` is 1, so `2 + m // a` is \(2 + 1 = 3\).
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `b`, then `m // a` is at least 1, so `2 + m // a` will be at least 3, and possibly larger depending on the exact values of `m` and `a`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(2 + m // a)` statement will be:
- **2** if `m` is less than `a`.
- **3** if `m` is between `a` and `b`.
- **At least 3** if `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 + m // a (where the value is 2 if m is less than a, 3 if m is between a and b, and at least 3 if m is greater than or equal to a or b)**
