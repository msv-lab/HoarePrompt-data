Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from input. It constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in the list to a corresponding character in the alphabet and appending it to `r`. The constructed string `r` is printed for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function does not return any value, but the output consists of `t` strings, each corresponding to a test case. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the completion of all test case iterations, with the final string `r` printed for each test case. **
