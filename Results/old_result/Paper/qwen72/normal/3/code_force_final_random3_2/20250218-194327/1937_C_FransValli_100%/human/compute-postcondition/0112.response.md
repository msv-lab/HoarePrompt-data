To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `item` and `arr`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop head is `for item in arr[1:]`.
   - This means the loop will iterate over the elements of `arr` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end of the list.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arr[1:]` must contain at least one element.
   - This implies that `arr` must have at least two elements (since `arr[1:]` starts from the second element).

3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list that contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<'.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute if `arr` has at least two elements.
   - Therefore, `arr` must have at least two elements for the loop to start.
   - The initial state of `item` is the last element of `arr`, but for the loop to start, `item` should be the second element of `arr`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
- `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
- `arr` must have at least two elements.
- `item` is the second element of `arr`.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the first element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`**
