Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `x`
- `z` is `x + 1`
- `a` is greater than or equal to `z` (which is `x + 1`)

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of `i`, `z`, and `a` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **YES**
