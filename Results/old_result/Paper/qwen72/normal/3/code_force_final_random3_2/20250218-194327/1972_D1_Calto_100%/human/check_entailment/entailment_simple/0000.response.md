### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. The state comments are accurate and the function returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The loop iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then adds \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) to the count, and an additional 1 if \(x\) is exactly divisible by \(y\).

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is not correct for the problem. The expression \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly addressed by the current implementation.
   - The formula used in the loop does not correctly count the valid pairs. It seems to be an incorrect transformation of the problem requirements.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case \((1, 1)\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), which is correctly counted.
   - For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\), the valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\). The program should return 14, but the current logic does not guarantee this.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **False**
