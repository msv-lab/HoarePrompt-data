Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of sides `n` of a regular polygon (where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a list of `x` distinct vertices chosen by Bessie (where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)). The function returns the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices for each test case.**
