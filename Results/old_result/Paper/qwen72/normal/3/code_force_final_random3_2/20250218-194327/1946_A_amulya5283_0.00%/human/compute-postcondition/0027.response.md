Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_median = arr[median_index]` reassigns the value of `current_median` to the element at the `median_index` in the sorted `arr`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The initial state information that was provided is still valid, including the values of `t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `heap`, and `operations`.
