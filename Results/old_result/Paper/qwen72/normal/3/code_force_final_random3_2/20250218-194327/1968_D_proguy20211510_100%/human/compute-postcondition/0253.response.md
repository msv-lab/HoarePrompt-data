The code snippet only contains a `break` statement, which means that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of the variables `i`, `pathb`, `curr`, `preb`, and `resb` do not change as a result of this statement. The condition that if `k` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, is also met by the `break` statement, but this does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of the fact that the most internal loop or if statement has been exited.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `pathb` is a list with at least 3 elements, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[1]`, `resb` is the maximum of the original `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, and `resb` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
