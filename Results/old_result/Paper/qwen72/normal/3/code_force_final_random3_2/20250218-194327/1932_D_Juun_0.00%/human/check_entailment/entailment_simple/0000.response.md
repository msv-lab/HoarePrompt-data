### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of cards.

2. **Card Processing:**
   - The program initializes a list `trumps` to store the ranks of trump cards and a dictionary `suits` to store the ranks of non-trump cards.
   - It iterates over the list of cards, splitting each card into its rank and suit.
   - If the card's suit matches the trump suit, it appends the rank to the `trumps` list.
   - If the card's suit is already in the `suits` dictionary and not `None`, it forms a pair of cards with the same suit and appends it to the `answers` list, then sets the suit to `None`.
   - If the card's suit is not in the `suits` dictionary or is `None`, it stores the rank in the `suits` dictionary.

3. **Forming Pairs with Trumps:**
   - After processing all cards, the program iterates over the `suits` dictionary.
   - For each non-`None` rank in the `suits` dictionary, it tries to form a pair with a trump card.
   - If a trump card is available, it appends the pair to the `answers` list and removes the trump card from the `trumps` list.
   - If no trump card is available, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns early, indicating that it is impossible to form all required pairs.

4. **Forming Pairs with Remaining Trumps:**
   - The program sorts the remaining trump cards and prints them in pairs.
   - If there are an odd number of trump cards, the last card will not be paired, but this is not a problem because the program ensures that all non-trump cards are paired first.

5. **Printing Remaining Pairs:**
   - Finally, the program prints the pairs stored in the `answers` list.

### Issues:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it should take `n`, `trump`, and `cards` as parameters.
  - The function `func_1` should be called with the appropriate parameters in the main loop.

- **Card Splitting:**
  - The line `rank, suit = card` should be `rank, suit = card[0], card[1]` to correctly split the card string into rank and suit.

- **Pair Formation:**
  - The program does not handle the case where there are more non-trump cards than trump cards, which could lead to an incorrect solution or an "IMPOSSIBLE" result when it should be possible.

### Correctness:
- **False**

The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly handling all possible inputs and forming valid pairs of cards. Specifically, the function `func_1` should take parameters, and the card splitting should be corrected. Additionally, the logic for forming pairs with trump cards needs to be more robust to handle all edge cases.
