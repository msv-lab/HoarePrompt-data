Output State: **`maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0), `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either `[0]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0), `minn` is 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `mex` now contains an additional element which is the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn`.**

If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `[0]` and `minn` is 1, and `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn` if it is greater than the current `maxx`, and `mex` contains the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn`. The `mex` list now has one more element appended to it, which is the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn`.
