Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf`.**

The value of `i` is set to 1, overriding its previous value which was equal to the length of `ar`. The other variables remain unchanged.
