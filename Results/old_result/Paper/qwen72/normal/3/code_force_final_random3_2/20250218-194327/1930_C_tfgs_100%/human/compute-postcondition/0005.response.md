Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1; `a[1]` is now `a[1] + 2`.** 

The value of `a[1]` has been updated by adding 2 to its original value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
