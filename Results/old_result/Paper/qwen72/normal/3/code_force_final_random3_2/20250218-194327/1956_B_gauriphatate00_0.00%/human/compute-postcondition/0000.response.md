Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, and no other variables are affected.**

The function now reads input from stdin using the `sys.stdin.read` method, but no actual input has been processed yet. The initial state of no variables being passed in the function signature remains unchanged. The expectation for the input format (number of test cases and details of each test case) is still valid.
