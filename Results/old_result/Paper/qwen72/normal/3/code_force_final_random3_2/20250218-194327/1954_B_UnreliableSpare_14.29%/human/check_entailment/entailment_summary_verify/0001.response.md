### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Loop Structure:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check for Identical Elements:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are identical (`flag` remains `True`), the program correctly outputs `-1` because an array of identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements.

3. **Counting and Minimum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be minimized.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive occurrences of the first element `val` and stores this count in `cnt`.
   - For each different element encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - Finally, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` after the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - If the array is not all identical, the program outputs the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:

1. **Use of `Decimal` for Integer Operations:**
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `Decimal` for integer operations is unnecessary and can be simplified. Python's `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9` would suffice.

2. **Logic for Non-Identical Elements:**
   - The logic for counting and finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only counts the consecutive occurrences of the first element and does not consider the general case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements that allow the operation to be applied.
   - The correct approach would be to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for all `i`.

### Correct Approach:

To make an array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced by `a[i-1]`. This can be achieved by removing elements that allow such a pattern to exist.

### Corrected Program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
            ans = min(ans, 1)
    
    # If no such index is found, the array is already non-beautiful
    if ans == float('inf'):
        print(0)
    else:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Set Check:** `len(set(arr)) == 1` checks if all elements in the array are identical.
- **Minimum Removal:** The program iterates through the array to find any index `i` where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and sets `ans` to 1, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
- **Output:** If no such index is found, the array is already non-beautiful, and the program outputs `0`.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the program, particularly the flawed logic for counting and finding the minimum number of elements to remove. The corrected program addresses these issues by checking for the presence of the pattern `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and ensuring that the minimum number of elements to remove is correctly calculated.

Final: **False**
