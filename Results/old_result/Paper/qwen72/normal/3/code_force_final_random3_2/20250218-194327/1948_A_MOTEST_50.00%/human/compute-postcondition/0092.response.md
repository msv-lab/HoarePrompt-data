Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 7 (not divisible by 2), `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2 + `s[3]` * 2, `x` is 3, `j` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `s[x] * 2` to its current value.
- The value of `x` is 3, so `s[3] * 2` is added to `ans`.
- The previous value of `ans` was 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1] * 2` + `s[2] * 2` + `s[3] * 2`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
