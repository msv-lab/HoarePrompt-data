Output State: **`arr` remains a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value is the count of how many times that tuple has been encountered, `count` is the total number of times a key `(r_x, r_y)` has been found in `residue_map` before the current iteration, `results` is a list that now includes `count` as its last element.**
