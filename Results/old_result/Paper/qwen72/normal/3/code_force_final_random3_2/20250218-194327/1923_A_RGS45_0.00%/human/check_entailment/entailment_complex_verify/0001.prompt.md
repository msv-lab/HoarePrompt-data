You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). Additionally, at least one cell in each test case contains a chip. The function should be able to process a list of such test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: `_` is `t - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a string `arr` of length `n` where each character is either '0' (free cell) or '1' (cell with a chip). The function outputs the number of free cells ('0') between the first and last chip ('1') in each ribbon, inclusive. The function does not return any value; it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that all test cases have been processed, and the results have been printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the ribbon configuration `arr` as a string of '0's and '1's.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (from the left).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first chip from the right, which is equivalent to the index of the last chip from the left.

3. **Extracting the Subarray:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the subarray from the first chip to the last chip. This subarray will contain all the chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells ('0's) in the subarray `z`. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Analysis:
- The approach correctly identifies the subarray that contains all the chips and any free cells between them.
- The number of free cells in this subarray is indeed the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Chip:** If there is only one chip, the subarray will contain no free cells, and the function will correctly output `0`.
- **No Free Cells Between Chips:** If there are no free cells between the chips, the subarray will contain no '0's, and the function will correctly output `0`.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The function handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over the range `t`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
