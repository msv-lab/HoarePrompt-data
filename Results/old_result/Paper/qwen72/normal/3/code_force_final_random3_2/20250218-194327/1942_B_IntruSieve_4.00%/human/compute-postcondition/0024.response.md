Output State: **`maxx` is the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn`, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` now contains an additional element which is the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn`, `minn` is 0 or 1, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn`.
- The values of `func_1`, `n`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
