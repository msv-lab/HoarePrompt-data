Postcondition: ***`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 3 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[mdx + 1]`, otherwise `res` is 1. If `a[mdx]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 2 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[mdx + 1]`, otherwise `res` remains 0.***
