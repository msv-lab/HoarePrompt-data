Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and the values `factor * prime_to_i` have been yielded for each iteration from 0 to `factors[prime]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `factors[prime] + 1` iterations.
- In each iteration, `prime_to_i` is multiplied by `prime`.
- After all iterations, `prime_to_i` will be `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`.
- The loop yields `factor * prime_to_i` in each iteration, so all these values will have been yielded by the end of the loop.
