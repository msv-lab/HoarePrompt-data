Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values computed during the loop, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` for each iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- After all iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` will be a non-negative integer, which could be zero if the loop has reduced `n` to zero.
- `k` will be a non-negative integer, which could be zero if `k` has been reduced to zero through the loop's operations.
- `rep` will be at most 60, as the loop will stop if `rep` reaches 60.
- `number` will be the last value of either `Min` or `Max` that was computed during the loop.
- `tab` will be a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values that were computed and appended during the loop's execution.
- `n` will be updated to `n - Min * Max` for each iteration, reflecting the reduction in `n` as the loop progresses.
