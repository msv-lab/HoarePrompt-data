Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 29, `range(30)` is a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is '1' if the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1, and '0' if the corresponding bit in `x` is 0, `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `range(0, 29)` is a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is '1' if the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1, and '0' if the corresponding bit in `x` is 0. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `flag` is set to 1 and the first element of `s` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and the first element of `s` is either not '1' or not equal to `s[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `range(0, 29)` is a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is '1' if the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1, and '0' if the corresponding bit in `x` is 0. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1' and `s[1]` is equal to `s[2]`, then `flag` is set to 1 and `s[0]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, `s[1]` is '0', and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1' but `s[1]` is not equal to `s[2]`, or if `s[1]` is not '1', then `flag` remains 0 and the first element of `s` is either not '1' or not equal to `s[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `range(0, 29)` is a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is '1' if the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1, and '0' if the corresponding bit in `x` is 0. If `flag` is 0, `s[2]` is '1', and `s[3]` is '1', then `s[2]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is '0', `flag` remains 0 and the first element of `s` is either not '1' or not equal to `s[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
