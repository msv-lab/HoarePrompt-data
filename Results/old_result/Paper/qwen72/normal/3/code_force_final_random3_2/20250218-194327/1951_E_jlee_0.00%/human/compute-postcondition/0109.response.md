Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is a non-negative integer, `count2` is a positive integer less than or equal to `count` with specific conditions and is now `count2 + 1`, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.**
