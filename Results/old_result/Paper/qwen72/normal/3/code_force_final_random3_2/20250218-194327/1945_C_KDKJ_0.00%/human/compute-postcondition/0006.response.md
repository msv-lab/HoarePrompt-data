Output State: **`int(input())` must return a value greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `func_1()` has been called the specified number of times.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will have executed the exact number of times specified by the user input, and the function `func_1()` will have been called that many times. The initial state of no variables being passed to `func_2` remains unchanged, as the loop and its body do not modify any variables outside of the loop.
