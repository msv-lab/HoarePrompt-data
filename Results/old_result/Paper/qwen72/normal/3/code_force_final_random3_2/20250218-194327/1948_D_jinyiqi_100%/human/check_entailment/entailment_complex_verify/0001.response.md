### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.

2. **Tandem Repeat Check:**
   - The program iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat, starting from the largest possible length (half the length of the string) down to 1.
   - For each length `j`, it checks if there is a substring of length `2*j` that can be a tandem repeat by comparing characters in the first half and the second half of the substring.

3. **Character Comparison:**
   - The program uses a nested loop to check each possible starting position `k` for a substring of length `2*j`.
   - It increments a `count` variable if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either both question marks, both the same character, or one of them is a question mark.
   - If the characters do not match and neither is a question mark, it resets the `count` to 0.

4. **Tandem Repeat Validation:**
   - If the `count` reaches `j`, it means that a valid tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found.
   - The program then prints the length of this tandem repeat (`count * 2`) and returns from the function.

5. **No Tandem Repeat Found:**
   - If no valid tandem repeat is found for any length, the program prints 0.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program correctly identifies the longest possible tandem repeat by checking all possible lengths from the largest to the smallest.
  - It correctly handles question marks by considering them as wildcards that can match any character.
  - The logic for checking the tandem repeat is sound and should work for the given constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where the string contains only question marks by finding the longest possible tandem repeat.
  - It also handles the case where no tandem repeat can be formed by printing 0.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is acceptable given the constraints \(1 \le |s| \le 5000\) and the total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **Initial State:**
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - The function reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.
  - The length of the string `n` is calculated.

- **Outer Loop:**
  - The outer loop iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat, starting from `n // 2` down to 1.
  - For each length `j`, the inner loop checks for the presence of a tandem repeat of length `2*j`.

- **Inner Loop:**
  - The inner loop iterates over possible starting positions `k` for a substring of length `2*j`.
  - It increments the `count` variable if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either both question marks, both the same character, or one of them is a question mark.
  - If the characters do not match and neither is a question mark, it resets the `count` to 0.
  - If `count` reaches `j`, it prints `count * 2` and returns, indicating that a valid tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found.

- **Final State:**
  - If the loop completes without finding a valid tandem repeat, the program prints 0 and returns.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the constraints provided. It correctly handles the replacement of question marks and finds the longest possible tandem repeat substring.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
