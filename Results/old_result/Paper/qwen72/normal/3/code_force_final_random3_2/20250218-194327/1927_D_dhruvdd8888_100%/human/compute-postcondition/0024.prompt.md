Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)`. The list `a` contains integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the length of `a` is 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each query `(l, r)` satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The number of test cases `t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the total number of queries across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The `input` function is now `sys.stdin.readline`. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional `-1` appended to it. `s` is 0. `e` is 0. `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`. `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `N` is greater than or equal to 0. `num` is equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums[0]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1, 0, num)` at the end, and `s` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` or `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `nums[1]`. If `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` at the end, and `s` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` or `s`, and `s` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `num` is equal to `nums[2]`. If `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` at the end and `s` is 1. If `nums[2]` is not equal to `nums[1]`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` at the end, and `s` is now 2. If `nums[2]` is equal to `nums[1]`, `arr` and `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
