Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list, `q` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, and 'NO' is printed if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise 'YES' is printed.**

Explanation:
- The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`.
- The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are input integers, which is consistent with the code.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `b[i]`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The condition for printing 'NO' or 'YES' is still valid and depends on the values of `a` and `b` at the indices `x` and `y`, which are now input integers.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `x` and `y` are now specifically the input integers provided by the user.
