Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `number` is `Min` and `k` is `k - Max`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains greater than 0. The value of `n` remains `n - Min * Max` and must still be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `k` remains a positive integer or 0 and must still be greater than `Min`. The value of `rep` remains 1. The list `tab` now contains the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`. The values of `Min` and `Max` remain `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively. The value of `number` and `k` are updated based on the conditions: if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `number` is `Min` and `k` is `k - Max`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.
