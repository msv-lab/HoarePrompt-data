The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 2**
