### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, and you can choose no more than `y` additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - In this version, `y` is fixed at 0, meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads `x` distinct integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The function prints `x - 2` for each test case.
   - This is based on the fact that for any set of `x` vertices in a polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The calculation `x - 2` is correct for the given problem constraints, as it accurately determines the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle the minimum and maximum values of `x` and `n` as specified in the problem constraints.
   - For `x = 2`, the function correctly outputs `0` because no triangles can be formed with only 2 vertices.
   - For `x = 3`, the function correctly outputs `1` because exactly one triangle can be formed with 3 vertices.
   - For larger values of `x`, the function correctly outputs `x - 2`.

6. **State of the Program**:
   - The comments indicate the state of the program at different points, and they are consistent with the logic of the function.
   - After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are left with the values from the last test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: True**
