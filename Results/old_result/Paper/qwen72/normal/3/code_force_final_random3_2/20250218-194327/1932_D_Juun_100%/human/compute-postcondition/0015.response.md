Postcondition: ***`card` is the first card description in the list generated by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`, and `suit` is not equal to `trump`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` now contains a string that is the concatenation of `suit` and `rank` or `suits[suit]` and `rank`, sorted alphabetically, separated by a space. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.***
