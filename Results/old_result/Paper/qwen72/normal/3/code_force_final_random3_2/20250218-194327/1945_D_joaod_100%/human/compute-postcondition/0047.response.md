Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `na_frente` is -1.
   - `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user.
   - `v` is -1.
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` (initially an input integer minus 1) down to 0.
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(best)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `na_frente` is initialized to -1.
   - `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1. Let's denote the input integer as `input_int`, so `pos_final = input_int - 1`.
   - `total` is calculated as the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0. Since `na_frente` is -1, the loop will start from -1 and go down to 0, which means it will include the cost at index 0.
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

4. **Calculation of `total`:**
   - The loop will start from `v = -1` and go down to `v = 0`.
   - Since `v = -1` is out of bounds for the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, the only valid index is `v = 0`.
   - Therefore, `total` will be the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.

5. **Calculation of `best`:**
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - Since `v = -1` is out of bounds, the only valid index is `v = 0`.
   - Therefore, `best` will be the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` where `total` is the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - `best` will be the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` where `total` is the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be the minimum value of the cost to perform the operations as described.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `total` is the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`)**
