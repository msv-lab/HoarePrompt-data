The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
