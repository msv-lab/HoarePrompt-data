The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes the assignment of new integer values to `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, the value of `i` as 1, `n` as a value greater than 1, and `k` as 0. However, these variables and their values do not influence the `print` statement, as the statement is simply printing a constant value `-1`.

Output: **-1**
