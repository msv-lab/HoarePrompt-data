Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Minimum Removals**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same. However, this does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The problem requires ensuring that no operations can be applied to the array to make all elements the same, which is not captured by simply finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Handling of Beautiful Array**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already beautiful and needs to be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program incorrectly outputs `1` because it finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array has only one element or when all elements are the same.
   - For an array with all elements the same, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
- If the array has only one element or all elements are the same, output `-1`.
- Otherwise, find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure no operations can make all elements the same.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove
        min_removals = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, 1)
        
        if min_removals == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_removals)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Check if All Elements are the Same**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, so we output `-1`.

2. **Find Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - Iterate through the array and check for indices `i` where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.
   - If such an index is found, the minimum number of elements to remove is `1` (since removing `a[i]` will prevent the operation from being applied).
   - If no such index is found, output `-1` because the array is already non-beautiful.

This approach correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases.
