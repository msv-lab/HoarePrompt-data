Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the value of `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is the value of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.** 

In natural language: The value of `res` is calculated as the product of `q[eta[0]]`, `q[eta[0]] - 1`, and `q[eta[0]] - 2`, divided by 6 and rounded down to the nearest integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
