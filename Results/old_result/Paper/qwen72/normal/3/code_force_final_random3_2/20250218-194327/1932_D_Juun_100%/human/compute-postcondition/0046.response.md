Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit, and `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. `rank` is the rank of the next suit in the dictionary that is not `None`, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, `answers` is a list that has been appended with a string in the format `'None{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` if `rank` is `None`, otherwise it has been appended with a string in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`.**

Explanation:
- The `answers` list is appended with a string in the format `'rank{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, where `rank` is the rank of the next suit in the dictionary that is not `None`, `suit` is the suit associated with `rank`, `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the `trumps` list, and `trump` is the suit of the trump card.
- If `rank` is `None`, the string appended to `answers` is in the format `'None{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`.
- The `trumps` list is now one element shorter.
- The values of `suits` and `rank` remain unchanged, but the `trumps` list and `answers` list are updated as described.
