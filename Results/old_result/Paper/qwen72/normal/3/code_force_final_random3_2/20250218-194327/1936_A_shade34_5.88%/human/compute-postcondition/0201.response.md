Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` will be the first element of the `pans` list.
   - `i` is `n-1`, so `pans[i]` will be the element at index `n-1` of the `pans` list.
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the first element of `pans` twice, and the element at index `n-1` of `pans` twice.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first element of `pans` is `pans[0]`.
   - The element at index `n-1` of `pans` is `pans[n-1]`.

Given that `pans` must have at least 2 elements, the print statement will output:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[n-1] is the element at index n-1 of the pans list)**
