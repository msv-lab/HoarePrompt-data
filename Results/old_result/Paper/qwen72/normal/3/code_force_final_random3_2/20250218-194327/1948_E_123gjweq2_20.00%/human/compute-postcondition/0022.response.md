Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `not_mid`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i`.** 

The value at the array index `left + mid + i` is updated to `right + 1 - i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
