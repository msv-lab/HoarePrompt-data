Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). The program always starts by printing the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), and then for the remaining points, it prints \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not ensure that the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized.

For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |1-3| + |1-2|, |1-3| + |2-3|, |1-2| + |2-3|\} = \{0, 1, 4, 3, 3, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}
\]
However, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5, which is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\). The maximum size for \(n = 3\) should be 4, as shown in the problem description.

A correct approach would involve a strategy that ensures the points are chosen such that the set of Manhattan distances is maximized. One such strategy is to place the points in a way that covers the maximum range of distances, such as placing points along the diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the grid.

For example, a correct solution for \(n = 3\) could be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
This would result in the set of Manhattan distances:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]
which has a size of 4, the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
