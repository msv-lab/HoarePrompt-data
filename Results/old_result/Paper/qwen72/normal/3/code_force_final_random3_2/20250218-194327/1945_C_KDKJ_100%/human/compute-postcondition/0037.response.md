To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Since the loop is a `for i in range(n + 1)`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1.

2. **Variable `n`**: The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. After the previous iteration, `n` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is now 1, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

3. **Other variables**: The variables `a`, `S`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. Their values remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n`, `ans` is -1**
