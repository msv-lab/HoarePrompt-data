Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines that a rectangle of size 1x3 (or 3x1) can be transformed into another rectangle, which is not true according to the problem description. The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even, but this logic fails for rectangles where both dimensions are odd and greater than 1, such as 1x3. In such cases, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle when recombined.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
1 3
```
Expected output:
```
No
```
Actual output from the program:
```
Yes
```
