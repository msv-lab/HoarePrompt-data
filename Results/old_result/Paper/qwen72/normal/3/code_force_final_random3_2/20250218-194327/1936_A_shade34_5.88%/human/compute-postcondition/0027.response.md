Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the input string, and the current value of `s` is '<'.**

The value of `mak` is updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak2` is also updated to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
