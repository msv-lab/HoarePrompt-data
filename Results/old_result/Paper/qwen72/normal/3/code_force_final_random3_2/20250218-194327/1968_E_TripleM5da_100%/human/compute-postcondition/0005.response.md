The code snippet provided is:
```
print(i, i)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 3.

The `print` statement will print the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly defined as 3, the output will be:

Output: **3, 3**
