Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, and `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list, `q` must be greater than 1, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state variables `n`, `i`, `b[i]`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged. The new values of `x` and `y` are now the input integers provided by the user.
