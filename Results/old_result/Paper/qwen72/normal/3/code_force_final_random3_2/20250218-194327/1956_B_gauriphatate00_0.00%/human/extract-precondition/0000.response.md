Precondition: **No variables are passed in the function signature, but the function reads input from stdin. The input is expected to be formatted as described in the problem statement, with the first line containing the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards in your hand, followed by a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand.**
