Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 2, and `cnt` is 1 or 2. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `i` remains 0 and `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 1, with `b[j]` being greater than or equal to `a[i-1]` and `cnt` is 1.**
