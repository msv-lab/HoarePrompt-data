The only object in the loop head is the variable `ii` and the loop control variable `tt`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be less than `tt`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has finished executing, which means `ii` was equal to `tt - 1` (since the range is 0-based). To start the next iteration, `ii` is incremented by 1, but for the loop to execute again, `tt` must be greater than the current value of `ii`.

State: **`ans` is increased by the value of `y`, `y` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`** 

However, this state is contradictory because if `ii` is `tt`, the loop condition `ii < tt` would not be satisfied, and the loop would not execute again. Therefore, the correct state should be:

State: **`ans` is increased by the value of `y`, `y` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`**
