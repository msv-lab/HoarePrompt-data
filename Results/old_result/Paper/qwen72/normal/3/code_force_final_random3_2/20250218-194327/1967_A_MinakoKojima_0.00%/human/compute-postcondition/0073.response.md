Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is unchanged, `a[i]` for all `i` in range `n` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each iteration, `ans` is `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a[i]` for all `i` in range `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
