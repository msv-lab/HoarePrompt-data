Postcondition: ***`c` is 2, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the list of tuples is unchanged, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the second character of `s`, `mi` remains 0 unless `j` is 'B', in which case `mi` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
