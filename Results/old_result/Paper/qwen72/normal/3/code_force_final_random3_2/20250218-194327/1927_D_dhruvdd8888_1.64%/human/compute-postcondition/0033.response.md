Based on the initial state provided:

- `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means that the user must input a positive integer.
- `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is split into two parts and each part is converted to an integer.
- The value of `tc` is greater than 5.
- The value of `ppp` is 23.

The code snippet is:
```
print(l, r)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input for `int(input())`**:
   - The user must input a positive integer, but this value is not directly used in the `print` statement.

2. **User Input for `l` and `r`**:
   - The user provides a string that is split into two parts.
   - Each part is converted to an integer and assigned to `l` and `r` respectively.
   - For example, if the user inputs "10 20", then `l` will be 10 and `r` will be 20.

3. **Values of `tc` and `ppp`**:
   - These values are mentioned but are not used in the `print` statement.

### Final Output:
The `print(l, r)` statement will print the values of `l` and `r`, which are the integers derived from the user input.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the integers provided by the user input)**

For example, if the user inputs "10 20", the output will be:
Output: **10, 20**
