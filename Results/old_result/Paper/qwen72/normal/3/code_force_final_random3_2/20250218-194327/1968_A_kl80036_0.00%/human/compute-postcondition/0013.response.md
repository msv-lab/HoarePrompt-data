The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process a number of test cases `t` where `1 <= t <= 1000`, and for each test case, an integer `x` where `2 <= x <= 1000` is involved. The function's output is not clearly specified, but it is expected to return some result for each test case based on the value of `x`.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function definition and the need to handle multiple test cases, the function might be designed to take input from another source, such as user input or a predefined list, and return a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. For each test case, it processes an integer `x` between 2 and 1000, inclusive, and returns a result for each test case.**
