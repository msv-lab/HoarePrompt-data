Output State: **`cnt` is now `cnt - 1`, `ans` has a new element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1.** 

The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, and the list `ans` is updated with a new element that is one less than its last element. The condition that `cnt` must be greater than 0 remains valid, assuming `cnt` was initially greater than 0.
