### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for each `i`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes two variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values in the permutation `p` respectively.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates over each element `a_i` in the array `a`.
   - If `a_i` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn` by 1. This is because if `a_i` is positive, it implies that `p_i` is the smallest missing integer (MEX) in the current prefix of `p`.
   - If `a_i` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary. This is because if `a_i` is negative, it implies that `p_i` is a value that is not the smallest missing integer but rather a larger value that has not appeared yet.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `p` (stored in `mex`), the program prints the elements of `mex`.

5. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided example:
     - For the first test case: `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
       - `a_1 = 1` implies `p_1 = 0` (since MEX of [0] is 1 and 1 - 0 = 1).
       - `a_2 = 1` implies `p_2 = 1` (since MEX of [0, 1] is 2 and 2 - 1 = 1).
       - `a_3 = -2` implies `p_3 = 4` (since MEX of [0, 1, 4] is 2 and 2 - 4 = -2).
       - `a_4 = 1` implies `p_4 = 2` (since MEX of [0, 1, 4, 2] is 3 and 3 - 2 = 1).
       - `a_5 = 2` implies `p_5 = 3` (since MEX of [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is 5 and 5 - 3 = 2).
     - The output is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

     - For the second test case: `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
       - `a_1 = 1` implies `p_1 = 0` (since MEX of [0] is 1 and 1 - 0 = 1).
       - `a_2 = 1` implies `p_2 = 1` (since MEX of [0, 1] is 2 and 2 - 1 = 1).
       - `a_3 = 1` implies `p_3 = 2` (since MEX of [0, 1, 2] is 3 and 3 - 2 = 1).
       - `a_4 = 1` implies `p_4 = 3` (since MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3] is 4 and 4 - 3 = 1).
       - `a_5 = 1` implies `p_5 = 4` (since MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] is 5 and 5 - 4 = 1).
     - The output is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is correct.

     - For the third test case: `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
       - `a_1 = -2` implies `p_1 = 2` (since MEX of [2] is 0 and 0 - 2 = -2).
       - `a_2 = 1` implies `p_2 = 0` (since MEX of [2, 0] is 1 and 1 - 0 = 1).
       - `a_3 = 2` implies `p_3 = 1` (since MEX of [2, 0, 1] is 3 and 3 - 1 = 2).
     - The output is `[2, 0, 1]`, which is correct.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The function `func_1` is not properly defined in the provided function definition, but the function is called correctly within the loop for each test case.
   - The logic for constructing the permutation `p` is consistent with the problem requirements.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions for the array `a`.
   - The logic and the implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.
   - The original assessment is accurate.
