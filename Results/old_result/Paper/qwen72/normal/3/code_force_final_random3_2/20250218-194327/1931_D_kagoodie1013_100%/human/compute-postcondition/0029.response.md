Output State: **`arr` is a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `r_y` is equal to `num % y`.** 

The code snippet assigns the value of `num % y` to the variable `r_y`. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial state with the addition of the value of `r_y` being `num % y`.
