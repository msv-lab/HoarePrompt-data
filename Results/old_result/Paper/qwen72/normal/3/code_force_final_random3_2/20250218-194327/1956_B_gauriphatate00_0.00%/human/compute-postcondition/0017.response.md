Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `3 + 2 * n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[3 + n]` to `data[3 + 2 * n - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(func_1(n, a))` appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list.
- The value of `n` and `a` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- The value of `idx` and `t` remain unchanged.
- The `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the result of `func_1(n, a)`.
- All other initial conditions remain valid.
