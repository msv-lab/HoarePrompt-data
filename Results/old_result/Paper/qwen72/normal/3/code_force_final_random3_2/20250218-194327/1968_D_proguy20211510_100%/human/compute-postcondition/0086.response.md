Output State: **`paths` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `pres` is `pres + paths[2]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 2)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`. If `k` is less than 3, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
