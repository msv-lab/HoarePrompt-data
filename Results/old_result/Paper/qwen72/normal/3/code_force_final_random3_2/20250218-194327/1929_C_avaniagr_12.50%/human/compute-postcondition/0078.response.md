Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are input integers with the same constraints as the initial state, and the loop counter `_` is incremented by `t`. The conditions for `a` relative to `x`, `k`, and `z` are evaluated for each iteration, and the results are printed accordingly.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the value of `t` will be decremented to 0 (or more precisely, the loop will have completed `t` iterations). The loop counter `_` will have been incremented by `t` (though `_` is not used in the loop, it simply counts the iterations). The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each iteration are input independently, so they remain as input integers with the same constraints as the initial state.

For each iteration, the loop checks the following conditions:
- If `x` is less than `k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, it calculates `z` by summing `1 + (z // (k - 1))` for `x + 1` times, and then checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The loop does not modify the values of `k`, `x`, or `a` between iterations; each set of values is read independently for each iteration. Therefore, the final state of `t` is 0 (or the loop has completed `t` iterations), and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are the same as they were for the last iteration of the loop. The loop counter `_` is incremented by `t`, but it is not used in the loop body, so its final value is not relevant to the output state.
