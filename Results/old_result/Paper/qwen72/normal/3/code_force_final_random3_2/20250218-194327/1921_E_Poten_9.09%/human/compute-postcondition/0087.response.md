Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` includes an additional 'Draw' at the end. Otherwise, `answers` includes an additional 'Bob' at the end. `clues` remains a list of integers provided by the user.***
