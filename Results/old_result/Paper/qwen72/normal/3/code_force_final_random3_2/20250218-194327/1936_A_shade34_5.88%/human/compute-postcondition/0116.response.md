The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the new input string, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`. If `s` is '<', `pans` is a list containing `[1]`, and `mak` is 1. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` remains an empty list, and `mak` is 0.**
