The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the range `n + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop will execute because `range(n + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive. Before the loop starts, `j` is `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `j` should start from 0. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 0 and `j` starts from 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list**
