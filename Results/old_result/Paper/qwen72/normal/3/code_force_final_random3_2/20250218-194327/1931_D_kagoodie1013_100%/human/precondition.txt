test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements (n, x, y) and a list a of n integers. For each tuple, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
