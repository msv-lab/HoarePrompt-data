The provided function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The function should take the necessary inputs to solve the problem. Based on the problem description, the function should take the number of test cases, the number of cards each player receives, and the list of integers on the cards in the player's hand. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```python
def max_points(t, cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in the player's hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
