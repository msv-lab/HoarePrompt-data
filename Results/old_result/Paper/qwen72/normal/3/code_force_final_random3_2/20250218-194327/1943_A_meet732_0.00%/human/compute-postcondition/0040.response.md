Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `cntl` to be a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The new state of `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
