Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). The program processes multiple test cases, each with an array and a series of queries. Let's break down the logic and see if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s`, `e`, and `num` to track the start of a range, the end of a range, and the current number, respectively.
   - It appends a `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the end of the array gracefully.
   - It iterates through the array to identify ranges of consecutive equal elements and stores these ranges in the list `arr`. Each tuple in `arr` contains `(start, end, value)`, where `start` and `end` are the indices of the range, and `value` is the element in that range.
   - It reads the number of queries and processes each query.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if there is a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\) within the range \([l, r]\):
     - If `s > l`, it checks if `s == 1` or `s > r`. If either condition is true, it prints `(-1, -1)`. Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
     - If `e >= r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
     - If `e < N` or `e < l`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

4. **Issues**:
   - The use of `bisect_left` with the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` is incorrect because `bisect_left` will compare the entire tuple, not just the first element. This can lead to incorrect indices being selected.
   - The conditions in the query processing are not correctly handling all edge cases. For example, if the range \([l, r]\) is entirely within a single range of equal elements, the program should print `(-1, -1)`, but the current logic may not handle this correctly.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - To correctly handle the queries, we should use a more straightforward approach to check if there are any different elements within the range \([l, r]\):
     - For each query, iterate through the range \([l, r]\) and check if there are any two different elements.
     - If found, print the indices. If not, print `(-1, -1)`.

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
