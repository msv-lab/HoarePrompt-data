Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 for each test case, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The sequence p is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, n is greater than 3, i is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, and the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the input integer, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was ever input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '>', `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
