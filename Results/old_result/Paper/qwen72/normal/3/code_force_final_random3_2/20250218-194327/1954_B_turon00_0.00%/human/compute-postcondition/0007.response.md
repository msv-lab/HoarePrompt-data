Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, and the current length of `aa` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `aa`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The value `-1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
