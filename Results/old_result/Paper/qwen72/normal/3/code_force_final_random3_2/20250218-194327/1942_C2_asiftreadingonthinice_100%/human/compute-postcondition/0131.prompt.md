Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `i` is the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` is now an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is now sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements. `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is 1. `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number and not equal to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is now sorted in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements. `ans` is `x + y` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not 2. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is 2. `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number and not equal to 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not an even number or is equal to 2, `tmp` is a list with one additional element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is now sorted in ascending order and must have at least 4 elements. `ans` is `x + y + 1` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is `x + y` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not 2. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is 3. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number and not equal to 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not an even number or is equal to 2, `tmp` is a list with one additional element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
