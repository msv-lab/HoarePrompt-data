### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing stones from the piles.
   - On each turn, a player must choose a positive integer \( k \) that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - If there is a pile with exactly 1 stone, the player whose turn it is will be forced to choose \( k = 1 \) on their turn. This will leave the other player with a configuration where all piles have an even number of stones.
   - If all piles have an even number of stones, the player whose turn it is can always choose \( k = 2 \) (or any even \( k \) that is at most the size of the smallest pile), ensuring that the piles remain even after their move. This strategy will eventually force the opponent to lose when all piles are empty.
   - If there is no pile with exactly 1 stone, the first player (Alice) can always choose \( k \) such that the number of stones in each pile becomes even, and then follow the strategy of always choosing an even \( k \) to ensure the opponent is forced to lose.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles \( n \) and the list of pile sizes \( l \).
   - It checks if there is any pile with exactly 1 stone using `if 1 in l`.
   - If there is a pile with 1 stone, it prints "Bob" because Bob will win if Alice is forced to choose \( k = 1 \).
   - If there is no pile with 1 stone, it prints "Alice" because Alice can always choose an even \( k \) and force Bob to lose.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there is a pile with 1 stone correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all piles have more than 1 stone correctly.
   - The program does not need to handle the case where all piles are empty initially because the problem guarantees that each pile has at least 1 stone.

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input (stdin).
   - Each test case consists of an integer \( n \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers.
   - For each test case, the function checks if the number `1` is present in the list of integers.
   - If `1` is found, it prints 'Bob' to standard output (stdout); otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.
   - The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the processed test cases and the corresponding output for each.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the presence of a pile with exactly 1 stone. If such a pile exists, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. The logic is sound and aligns with the optimal play strategy.
