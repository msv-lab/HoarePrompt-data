Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, which is now true after the code execution.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The value of `m` is still the smallest integer in the list `a`, but the list `a` has been updated with the new input values.
- The condition for `_` being incremented by 1 and being less than `t` for the loop to execute again remains valid.
