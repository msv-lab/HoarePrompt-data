Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and its current value is 2, `s` is an input string. If `s` is '00', the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `s` is not '00', the program behaves as specified in the else part.***
