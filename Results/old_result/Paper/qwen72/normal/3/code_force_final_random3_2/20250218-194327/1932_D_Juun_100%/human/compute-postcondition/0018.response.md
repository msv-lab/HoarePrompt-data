Output State: **`card` is the second card description in the list generated by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`.**

Explanation:
- The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the `card` string into two variables, `rank` and `suit`.
- `rank` is now the first character of `card`.
- `suit` is now the second character of `card`.
- The initial state information about `trumps`, `suits`, and `answers` remains unchanged and is not affected by this code snippet.
