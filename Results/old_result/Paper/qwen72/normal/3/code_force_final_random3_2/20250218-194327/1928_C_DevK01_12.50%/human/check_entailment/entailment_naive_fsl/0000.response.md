Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the way it handles the calculation and the conditions for determining valid values of \( k \). Specifically, the function `func_1` and the main loop have some problems that can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Issues:
1. **Handling of `w` (square root of `q`):**
   - The program checks if `w` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, it should also check if `w` is a valid \( k \) by ensuring that it fits the pattern described in the problem.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the program calculates `y = 12` and `q = 5`. The square root of `5` is not an integer, so `w` is not added to `M`. However, \( k = 5 \) is a valid solution in this case, but the program misses it.

2. **Range of `i` in `func_1`:**
   - The loop in `func_1` iterates from `1` to `int(w) - 1`, which can miss valid \( k \) values. For example, if `q = 10` and `x = 3`, the loop only checks `i` up to `3` (since `w = 3.16`), but it should check all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

3. **Condition for adding `q // i` to `M`:**
   - The program checks if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and adds it to `M`. However, it should also check if `q // i` is a valid \( k \) by ensuring it fits the pattern described in the problem.

### Example Case:
For the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the correct output should be `4` because \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) are valid. However, the program outputs `3` because it misses \( k = 5 \).

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Calculate the range of possible \( k \) values based on the given \( n \) and \( x \).
- Check if each \( k \) fits the pattern described in the problem.
- Count the number of valid \( k \) values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    valid_ks = set()
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k - 1 and (n - 1) // (2 * k - 2) * (2 * k - 2) + x == n:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

This corrected version correctly handles the calculation and checks for valid \( k \) values, ensuring that it meets the problem description for every potential case.
