Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie. Given that Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices and `y = 0` (meaning no additional vertices can be chosen), the task is to maximize the number of triangles using only these `x` vertices.

In a regular polygon, the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2`. This is a well-known property in combinatorial geometry: any convex polygon with `x` vertices can be triangulated into exactly `x - 2` triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input. It then reads the `x` chosen vertices and prints `x - 2` for each test case. This matches the expected output for the given problem constraints and examples.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
