Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of `n` integers. It processes these test cases by calling another function `func_1` and prints the results of each test case. After the function concludes, the program has read and processed `t` test cases, and the results of these test cases have been printed to the standard output. **
