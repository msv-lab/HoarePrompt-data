Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged; `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `pb` is updated to the value at the index `pb - 1` in the list `p`. All other variables and their states remain the same as in the initial state.
