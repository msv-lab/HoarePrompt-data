Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is the first element of the first list in `S`, `lsum` is the sum of the first and second elements of the first list in `S`, `right` is the second element of the last list in `S` minus the second element of the first list in `S`, `rsum` is `n` - `lsum`. Additionally, either `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
