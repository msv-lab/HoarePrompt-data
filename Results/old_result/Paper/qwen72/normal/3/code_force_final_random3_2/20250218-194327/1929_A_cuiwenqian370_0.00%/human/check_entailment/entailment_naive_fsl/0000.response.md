Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` for constructing `new_arr` is flawed. The algorithm alternates between appending the largest and smallest remaining elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The expected output is 6, as the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, where the beauty is calculated as:
```
(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 6
```

However, the program constructs `new_arr` as `[4, 1, 3, 2]` and calculates the beauty as:
```
(1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2
```

This is clearly incorrect, as the beauty should be maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
