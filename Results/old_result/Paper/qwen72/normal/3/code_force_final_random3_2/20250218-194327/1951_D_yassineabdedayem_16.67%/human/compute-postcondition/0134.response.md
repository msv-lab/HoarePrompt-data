Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min` and greater than `Max` or `Min` depending on the condition, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `number` is updated to `Max`.
- `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`) remain unchanged.
- The list `tab` still contains the string representation of the original `number` and the string representation of the updated `number` (which is now `Max`).
