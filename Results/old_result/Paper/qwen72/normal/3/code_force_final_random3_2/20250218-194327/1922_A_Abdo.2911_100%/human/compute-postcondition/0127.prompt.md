Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n - 1`, and `possible` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is equal to either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 1. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] == a[i]`, `possible` retains its initial value. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or if statement. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the program continues without modifying `possible`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
