The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the condition `j < n` to hold true.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[0]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 1**
