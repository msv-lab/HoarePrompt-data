Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `a[1]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.** 

The value of `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`, and the states of the other variables remain as described in the initial state.
