Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1, and `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end.** 

The code snippet `paths.append(a[ps - 1])` adds the element at index `ps - 1` of the list `a` to the end of the list `paths`. All other variables and the state of `vis` remain the same as in the initial state.
