#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. Based on the problem description, the function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. Additionally, the function should be called multiple times within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and `a` is a list of integers of size `n` where each element `a_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is currently a placeholder and does not perform any actions. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The function's intended purpose, based on the annotations, is to process a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list, but this is not reflected in the actual code. After the function concludes, the program state remains unchanged.
