Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the condition used to determine if the tower can have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not correct for this problem. The correct condition should be based on the parity of `n` and `m` because:

1. If `n` is even, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can only be even (since each move either adds or removes one cube, and starting from 0, an even number of moves will result in an even number of cubes).
2. If `n` is odd, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can only be odd.

Thus, the correct condition should be:
- If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n % 2 == m % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version correctly checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.
