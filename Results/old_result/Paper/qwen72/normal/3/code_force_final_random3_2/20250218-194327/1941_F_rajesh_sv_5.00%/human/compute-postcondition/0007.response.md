Output State: **`testcases` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `func_6()` has been called `testcases` times.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will have completed all its iterations if `testcases` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop was set to run. The function `func_6()` will have been called exactly `testcases` times, and no other variables will have been affected by the loop.
