Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` is set to `h` if `h` is not '02', '01', and `time` is set to 'AM' if `h` is '00', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', and 'PM' if `h` is '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23'. If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '01', `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.***
