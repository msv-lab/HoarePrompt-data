Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2
- `a` is an input string
- `b` is a new input string
- `k` is 1
- `no_path` is True

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k)
```

The variable `k` is explicitly defined as 1. Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `k`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
