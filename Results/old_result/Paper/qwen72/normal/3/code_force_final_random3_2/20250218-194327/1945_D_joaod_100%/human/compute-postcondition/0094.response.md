Let's break down the task step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\).
- `cases` must be greater than 1.
- `c` is 1.
- `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `v` is -1.
- `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0.
- `best` is the minimum of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `na_frente` and `pos_final`**:
   - `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1. This means if the first integer from the input is `x`, then `na_frente = x - 1`.
   - `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2. This means if the second integer from the input is `y`, then `pos_final = y - 2`.

2. **Calculating `total`**:
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0.
   - This means `total` is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{total} = \sum_{i=0}^{\text{na_frente}} \min(\text{custo_pra_trocar_a}[i], \text{custo_pra_passar_b}[i])
     \]

3. **Calculating `best`**:
   - `best` is the minimum of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - This means `best` is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{best} = \min_{i=0}^{\min(\text{na_frente}, \text{pos_final})} (\text{total} + \text{custo_pra_trocar_a}[i])
     \]

### Final Output:
The `print(best)` statement will print the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the minimum of `na_frente` and `pos_final`.

Since the exact values of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `best`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `best` value.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum value of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i] for all i from 0 to the minimum of na_frente and pos_final)**
