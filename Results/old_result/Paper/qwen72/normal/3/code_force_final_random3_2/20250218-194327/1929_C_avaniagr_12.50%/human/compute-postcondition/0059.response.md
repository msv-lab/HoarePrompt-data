Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `a` >= `x` + 1, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. Otherwise, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.*** 

However, since the postconditions for both the if and else parts are identical, the overall postcondition can be simplified to:

Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.***
