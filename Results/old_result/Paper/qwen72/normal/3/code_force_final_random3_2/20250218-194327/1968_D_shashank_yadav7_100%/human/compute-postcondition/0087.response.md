Output State: **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged if `k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is decremented by 1, with the condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged if `k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `k` is not 0, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is decremented by 1, with the condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
