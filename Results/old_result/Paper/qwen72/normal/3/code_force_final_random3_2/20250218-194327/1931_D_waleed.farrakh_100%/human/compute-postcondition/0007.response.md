The code `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))` splits the string at `data[2]` (since `idx` is 1) into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is an empty list, `idx` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first part of the string at `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of the second part of the string at `data[1]`, `y` is the integer value of the third part of the string at `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the string at `data[2]`.**
