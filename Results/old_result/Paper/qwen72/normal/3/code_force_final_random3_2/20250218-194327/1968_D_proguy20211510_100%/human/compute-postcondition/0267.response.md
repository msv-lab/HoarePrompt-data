Output State: **`i` is `len(pathb)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`, `paths` must have at least `len(pathb) + 1` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the previous `ress` and `curr`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `i`, `preb`, `resb`, `paths`, `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
