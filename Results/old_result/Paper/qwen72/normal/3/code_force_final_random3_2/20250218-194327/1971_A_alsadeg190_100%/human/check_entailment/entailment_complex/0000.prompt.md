Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of two integers (x, y) such that 0 <= x, y <= 9. The number of test cases, t, should be a non-negative integer where 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `x` times, where `x` is the initial value provided in the test case. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers. If the new `x` is less than the new `y`, then `x` and `y` are printed in that order. Otherwise, `y` and `x` are printed in that order. The value of `i` is `x-1` after the final iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `x` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, and prints them in ascending order. The function performs this action for each of the `x` test cases. After the function concludes, the input values have been processed and printed, but no data is returned or stored.
