The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases `t` is also given, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the size `n` of the matrix.
