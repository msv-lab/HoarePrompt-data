The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the list.
- `q`: an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of queries.
- For each query, `l` and `r` are integers (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the range of indices in the list `a`.

The function returns the results of the queries based on the provided parameters. Each query result is determined by the values in the list `a` within the specified range `[l, r]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, an integer `n` indicating the length of a list `a` of integers, the list `a` itself, an integer `q` indicating the number of queries, and for each query, two integers `l` and `r` representing the range of indices in `a`. The function returns the results of the queries based on the specified ranges in the list `a`.**
