Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in the specified pattern, `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was initially.
- The loop variable `i` has reached `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterates to.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially.
- The variables `left` and `right` remain unchanged as they were initially.
- The list `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in the specified pattern, where the last element is appended first, followed by the first element, then the second-to-last element, and so on.
- The variable `max_beauty` now holds the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`. This means that `max_beauty` has accumulated the total "beauty" of the differences between each pair of adjacent elements in the `new_arr` list.
