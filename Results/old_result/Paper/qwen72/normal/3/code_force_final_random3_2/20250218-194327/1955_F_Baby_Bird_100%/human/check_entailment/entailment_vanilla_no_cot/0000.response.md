Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Logic for Maximum Bob Wins**:
   - The program uses a list comprehension to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - For each test case, it computes the sum of a series of values derived from the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is used to determine the contribution of each count to the total number of Bob's wins.
     - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs that can be formed from the count `x`.
     - `3 * (x // 2)` accounts for the fact that each pair of the same number (1, 2, or 3) can be removed without changing the XOR result, and each such removal contributes to Bob's win.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2, which is 1 if `x` is odd and 0 if `x` is even.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` ensures that the contribution of the odd count is only considered for the first three numbers (1, 2, and 3), as the fourth number (4) is always even and does not contribute to the XOR result in the same way.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to get the final number of Bob's wins.
   - This is because each triplet of numbers (1, 2, 3) can be removed in such a way that the XOR result remains zero, which is optimal for Bob.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, each on a new line.

The logic and implementation align with the problem's requirements, ensuring that Bob wins as many times as possible by removing numbers optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
