The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range limit `2`. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `lex` because `range(2)` will always produce a sequence of two numbers (0 and 1), ensuring that the loop runs twice.

However, since the task is to adjust the states for the loop to execute, and the loop will execute as long as the range is defined, we only need to ensure that the loop head variables are correctly set for the first iteration. 

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0**
