Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer that must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]` (whichever is smaller), `x` is the value of `nums[1]` (if `nums[0]` <= 0, `x` is 0; otherwise, `x` is `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` based on the previous condition).**
