Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - The current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and values for variables `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, and `e`, but these values are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same values regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, and `e`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
