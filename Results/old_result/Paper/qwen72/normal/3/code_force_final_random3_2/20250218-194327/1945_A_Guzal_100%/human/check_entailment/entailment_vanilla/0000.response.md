### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Introverts:**
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents needed for introverts is `a`.

3. **Extroverts:**
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. This means we need to form groups of 3 people for each tent that includes an extrovert.
   - The number of tents needed for extroverts is `b // 3` (full groups of 3 extroverts) plus any additional tents needed to accommodate the remaining extroverts.

4. **Universals:**
   - Universals can be used to fill in the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts.
   - If `b % 3` is not zero, we need to check if there are enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts. Specifically, if `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means we cannot form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts and universals, and the program should output `-1`.

5. **Total Tents Calculation:**
   - The total number of tents is the sum of tents needed for introverts and the tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - The program calculates the total number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
   - If there are any remaining people after forming the groups of 3, an additional tent is added (`k += 1`).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of tents for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the case where it is impossible to form the required groups of 3 for extroverts and universals by checking `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` and printing `-1` if this condition is met.
- The calculation of the total number of tents is correct: `a` for introverts and `(b + c) // 3` for the groups of 3 people (extroverts and universals).
- The additional check `if (b + c) % 3 != 0` ensures that any remaining people are accounted for by adding an extra tent.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or to output `-1` if it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

### Correctness:
**True**
