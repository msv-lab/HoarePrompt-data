Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string and must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`.**

The code appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
