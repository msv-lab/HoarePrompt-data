Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements, and `v` has been appended to `nodes[u]` again.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 2, `i` is still 1, `u` and `v` are still input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as an additional element (so `v` is listed twice in `nodes[u]`), and `nodes[v]` still includes `u` as one of its elements.
