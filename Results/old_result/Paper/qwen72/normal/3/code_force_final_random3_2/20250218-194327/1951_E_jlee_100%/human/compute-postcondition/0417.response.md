Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
- `string` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
- `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`.
- `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
