The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(`arr`), and `arr` is a list of integers. The function returns a list of tuples, each representing a range within `arr`. The function's behavior is as follows:

1. If the length of the sublist `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` is 1 and the single element in this sublist is greater than 0, the function returns an empty list.
2. If the length of the sublist is 1 and the single element is less than or equal to 0, the function returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`.
3. If the length of the sublist is greater than 1 and the maximum value in the sublist is equal to the square of the length of the sublist, the function returns a list containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function searches for an index `i` within the range `(start_index + 1, end_index)` such that the sum of `func_1(start_index, i - 1)`, `func_1(i + 1, end_index)`, and `arr[i]` equals the maximum value in the sublist. If such an index is found, the function returns the concatenation of the results from `func_2(start_index, i - 1)` and `func_2(i + 1, end_index)`.
5. If no such index `i` is found, the function checks if the sum of `arr[start_index]` and `func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` equals the maximum value. If it does, the function returns the result of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)`.
6. If the above condition is not met, the function checks if the sum of `arr[end_index]` and `func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` equals the maximum value. If it does, the function returns the result of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)`.
7. If none of the conditions are met, the function does not return anything, resulting in `None` being returned.
