### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then reads the edges of the tree and constructs an adjacency list `nodes` to represent the tree.

2. **Tree Construction**:
   - The adjacency list `nodes` is built correctly using a `defaultdict` of lists. Each node is connected to its neighbors, and the tree structure is preserved.

3. **Leaf Identification**:
   - The program identifies the leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) and adds them to a deque `leaves`. This step is not necessary for the final solution but is correctly implemented.

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - The function `func_1` recursively explores the tree, returning a list of distances from the current node to all its leaf nodes. This is done by checking if the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is its parent). If it is a leaf, it returns `[0]`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for each neighbor that is not the parent and extends the distances list by adding 1 to each distance returned by the recursive call.
   - The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with the starting node and processes the result to determine the winner of the game.
   - The winner is determined by checking if any of the distances in the list `moves` is odd. If there is at least one odd distance, Ron wins because he can make the first move to an odd-distance node, and Hermione will be forced to make a move to an even-distance node, eventually leading to Ron's win. If all distances are even, Hermione wins because she will always have a move to an even-distance node, and Ron will be forced to make a move to an odd-distance node, eventually leading to Hermione's win.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the winner based on the game logic.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the game logic and handles the input and output as described in the problem statement. The recursive function `func_1` correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes, and the decision-making process in `func_2` is logically sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
