Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends`, the previous `curr`, and the new `curr`, `nodes[s]` contains at least one element that is not `e`, `prev` is now equal to the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is now equal to the second element in the list `nodes[curr]`.**
