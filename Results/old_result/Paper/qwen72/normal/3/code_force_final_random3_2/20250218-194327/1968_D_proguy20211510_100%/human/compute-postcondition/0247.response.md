Output State: **`i` is 1, `pathb` is a list with at least 2 elements, if `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[0]`, `resb` is the maximum of the original `resb` and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
