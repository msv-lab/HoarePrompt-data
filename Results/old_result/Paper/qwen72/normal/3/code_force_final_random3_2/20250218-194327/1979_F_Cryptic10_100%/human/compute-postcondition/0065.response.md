Output State: **`v3` is the first integer from the set `vx`, `_` is the second integer from the set `vx`, and `v3` is removed from `vx`. `v1` and `v2` are unchanged, `vx` has at least 1 element, `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `v3` is removed from the set `vx`.
- The initial state specified that `vx` has at least 2 elements, and after removing `v3`, `vx` now has at least 1 element.
- The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.
- The values of `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
- The value of `v3` and `_` are still as specified in the initial state, but `v3` is no longer in `vx`.
