Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is the maximum float value, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost to change `a[v]` is less than the cost to pass `b[v]`.**
