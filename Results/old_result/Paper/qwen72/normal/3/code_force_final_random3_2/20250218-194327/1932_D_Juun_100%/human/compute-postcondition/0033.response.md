Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `card` will have processed each card description in the list generated by `input().split()`. `rank` and `suit` will be the rank and suit of the last card description processed. `trumps` will be a list containing the ranks of all cards that matched the `trump` suit. `answers` will be a list containing strings for each pair of cards of the same suit (but not the trump suit) that were encountered, where the strings are the concatenation of the sorted ranks with the suit appended to each, separated by a space. `suits` will be a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit.**

This means:
- `card` will have processed all card descriptions provided in the input.
- `rank` and `suit` will hold the values of the last card description.
- `trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that had the same suit as the `trump`.
- `answers` will contain the results of all pairs of cards of the same non-trump suit that were encountered.
- `suits` will have `None` for any suit where all cards of that suit have been paired, and the rank of the last unpaired card for any suit that has an unpaired card.
