Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`s`**: This is a list of characters from an input string, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
2. **`n`**: This is the length of the list `s`, and it must be at least 2.
3. **`j`**: This is 0.
4. **`k`**: This is 2.
5. **`count`**: This is determined by the following conditions:
   - If `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 3.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
6. **Additional Condition**: `count` is not equal to `j`.

Given these conditions, let's evaluate the value of `count`:

- `k` is 2, so `s[k]` refers to the third element of the list `s`.
- `j` is 0, so `s[k + j]` also refers to the third element of the list `s`.

The conditions for `count` are:
- If `s[2]` is a question mark, `s[2]` is a question mark, or `s[2]` is equal to `s[2]`, then `count` is 3.
- Otherwise, `count` is 0.

Since `s[2]` is the same as `s[2]`, the condition `s[2] == s[2]` is always true. Therefore, `count` will always be 3.

Now, the print statement is:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

Since `count` is 3, `count * 2` will be `3 * 2 = 6`.

Output: **6**
