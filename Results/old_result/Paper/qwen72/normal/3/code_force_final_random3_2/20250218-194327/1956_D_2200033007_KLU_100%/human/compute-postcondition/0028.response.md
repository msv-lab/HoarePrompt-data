Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`, `j` is `start_index`, `arr[start_index]` is now `i`.**

The code `arr[j] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the element in the list `arr` at the index `j`. Since `j` is equal to `start_index`, the element at `arr[start_index]` is now `i`. The values of `i`, `start_index`, and the condition `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)` remain unchanged. The other elements in the list `arr` are also unchanged.
