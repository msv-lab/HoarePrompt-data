Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `possible` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
