Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The loop counter `_` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The variable `t` must still be greater than 0, as it was the condition for the loop to start.
- The variable `n` will hold the last input integer provided by the user for the final test case.
- The variable `arr` will hold the last input string provided by the user for the final test case.
- The variable `x` will be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the last input string `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.
- The variable `y` will be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed last input string `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.
- The variable `z` will be the substring of the last input string `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).
