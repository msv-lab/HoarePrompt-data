Output State: **`c` is 0, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), and the list of tuples is unchanged.**

The variables `c` and `d` are both initialized to 0. The other variables `ma`, `mi`, `m`, `s`, and `t` retain their initial values, and the list of tuples remains unchanged.
