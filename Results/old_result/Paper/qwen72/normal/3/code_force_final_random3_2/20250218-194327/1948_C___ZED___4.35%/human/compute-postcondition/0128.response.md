Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string. If `n` is 1, `k` and `no_path` remain unchanged. If `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True. If `no_path` is initially False and any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, if all characters at odd indices in `a` (from 1 to `k`) are '>', `no_path` becomes True.***
