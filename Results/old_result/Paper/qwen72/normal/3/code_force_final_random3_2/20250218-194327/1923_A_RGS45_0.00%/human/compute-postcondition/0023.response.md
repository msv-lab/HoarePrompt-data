The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). Additionally, at least one cell in each test case contains a chip. The function processes a list of such test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

The function returns the following based on the input:
- For each test case, if the ribbon contains at least one chip (1), the function returns a specific output related to the arrangement of chips in the ribbon.
- The exact nature of the output is not specified, but it is implied to be a result of processing the ribbon configuration.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` with elements 0 or 1. It returns a result for each test case based on the arrangement of chips in the ribbon, ensuring that at least one cell in each test case contains a chip.**
