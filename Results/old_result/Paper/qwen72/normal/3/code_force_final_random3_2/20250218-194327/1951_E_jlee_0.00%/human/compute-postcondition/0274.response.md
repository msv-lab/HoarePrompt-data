Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 6 characters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 3, `count2` retains its original value if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0. `done` retains its original value if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is set to True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to 3. If `count` is greater than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count` is not greater than 1, the `continue` statement moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
