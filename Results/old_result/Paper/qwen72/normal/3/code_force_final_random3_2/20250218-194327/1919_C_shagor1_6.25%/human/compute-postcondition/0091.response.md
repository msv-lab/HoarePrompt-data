Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`, `y` is equal to `a`, if `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a`. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is increased by 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `y` is now equal to the second element of the list `inp` (which is `a`). The conditions for updating `x` and `ans` remain unchanged, and the initial state of `inp` and `a` is still valid.
