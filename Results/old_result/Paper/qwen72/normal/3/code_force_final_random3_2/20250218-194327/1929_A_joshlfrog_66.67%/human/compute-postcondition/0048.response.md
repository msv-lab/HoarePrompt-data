Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `e` is 1.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is `l - 1`.
   - `x` is the maximum value in `nums`.
   - `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x - y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
   - The variable `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.
   - The `print` statement will output the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, based on the given information, the `print` statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
