Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, and `rev_res` is an empty string.**

The code snippet `list_len, max_power = input().split()` updates the values of `list_len` and `max_power` to the first and second parts of the new input string, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
