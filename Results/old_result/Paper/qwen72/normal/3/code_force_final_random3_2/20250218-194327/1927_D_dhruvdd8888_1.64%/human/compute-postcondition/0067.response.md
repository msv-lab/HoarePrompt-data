Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `tc` is greater than 5.
   - `ppp` is set to 23.
   - `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains greater than or equal to `r` and less than `N` or greater than or equal to `N`.
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(l, 0, 0)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement simply prints the values `-1` and `-1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `tc`, `ppp`, `eli`, or `LA`, the `print` statement will always print `-1, -1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
