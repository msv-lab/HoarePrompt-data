The variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` elements converted from the original list of strings.**
