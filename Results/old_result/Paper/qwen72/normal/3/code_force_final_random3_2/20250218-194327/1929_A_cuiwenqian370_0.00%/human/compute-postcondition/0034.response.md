Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in the specified pattern, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1]) + abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`**

Explanation: The value of `max_beauty` is updated by adding `abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` to its current value. Since `i` is 3, `max_beauty` becomes `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1]) + abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
