t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing the cards in the discard pile, where the first character is the rank ('2' to '9') and the second character is the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S').
