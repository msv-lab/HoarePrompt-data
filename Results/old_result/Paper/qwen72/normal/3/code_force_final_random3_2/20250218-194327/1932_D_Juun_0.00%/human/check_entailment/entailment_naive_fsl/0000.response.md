Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple cards of the same suit but no trump cards to beat them. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
2
D
3D 4D 5D 6D
```

In this case, the program will attempt to beat the 3D card with the 4D card, but then it will not have any cards left to beat the 5D card with the 6D card, leading to an incorrect output. The program should be able to handle such cases and output "IMPOSSIBLE" when it cannot form valid rounds. However, the current logic does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect solution.
