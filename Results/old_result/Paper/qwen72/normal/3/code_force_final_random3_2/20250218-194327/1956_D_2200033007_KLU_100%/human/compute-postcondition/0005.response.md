To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `j` and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of `0` to `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`.
- `j` is 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`.
- `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers.
- If the element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1.
- `i` remains the same because it is not modified in the loop head.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `i + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. If the element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.**
