Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element 26, `lex` is updated to a value between -25 and 25, `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is decreased by 26.
- If `lex` was between 26 and 51, it is now between 0 and 25.
- If `lex` was between 1 and 25, it is now between -25 and -1.
- If `lex` was exactly 26, it is now 0.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
