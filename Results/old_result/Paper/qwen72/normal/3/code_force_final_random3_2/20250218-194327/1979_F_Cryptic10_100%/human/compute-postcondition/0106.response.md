Output State: **`vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations. `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop. Each tuple in `ops` is either `(v1, v2)` where `v2` was greater than 0, or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` where `v2` was 0. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list.**

### Explanation:
- **`vx`**: Initially, `vx` contains integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive. The loop removes elements from `vx` until only two elements remain. After the loop finishes, `vx` will contain the last two integers that were not removed.
- **`ops`**: This list accumulates tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration of the loop. If `v2` is greater than 0, the tuple `(v1, v2)` is added to `ops`. If `v2` is 0, the tuple `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are added to `ops`, where `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.
- **`p1`**: This list is updated to contain the two integers that remain in `vx` after the loop finishes.
- **`p2`**: This list remains empty because it is only updated based on the contents of `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration, and `ops` is initially empty and only grows as the loop progresses. Since `p1[-1]` is not part of the initial `ops` list, `p2` remains unchanged.
