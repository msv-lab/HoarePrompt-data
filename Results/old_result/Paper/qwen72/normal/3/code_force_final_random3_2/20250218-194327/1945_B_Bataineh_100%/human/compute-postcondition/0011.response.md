Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers. `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`, and either `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is less than or equal to `b`. Additionally, `m` is either less than or equal to `a` or greater than or equal to `b`.***
