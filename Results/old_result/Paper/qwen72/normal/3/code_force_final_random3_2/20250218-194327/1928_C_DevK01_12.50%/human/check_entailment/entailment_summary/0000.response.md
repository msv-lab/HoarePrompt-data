### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where the first \( k \) people are numbered \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \), followed by the next \( k-2 \) people being numbered \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \), and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) that Vasya received.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) are related by the pattern. Specifically, \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = (2k-2)m + r \) where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( r \) is the remainder when \( n \) is divided by \( 2k-2 \).
   - The number \( x \) can be \( r \) if \( 1 \le r \le k \), or \( k - (r - k + 1) \) if \( k + 1 \le r \le 2k-2 \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls `func_1(q, x)`.
   - It then checks if \( n \ge 3x - 2 \) and calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` if true.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, converted to a set to remove duplicates, and the length of the set is printed.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It includes the square root of \( q \) if it is a perfect square and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - The function returns a list of these divisors.

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - The calculation of \( q \) and the calls to `func_1` are based on the correct mathematical relationship derived from the problem.
   - The combination of results and removal of duplicates using a set is appropriate to count the unique values of \( k \).
   - The logic for checking \( n \ge 3x - 2 \) and calling `func_1` again is also correct based on the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and the execution summary. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
