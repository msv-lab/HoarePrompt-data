Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`, where `2 <= n <= 100` and each element in `arr` is an integer such that `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`. It returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a new list `new_arr`, which is constructed by rearranging the elements of the sorted `arr` in a specific pattern: the last element is appended first, followed by the first element, then the second-to-last element, followed by the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended last. The final state of the program includes `arr` being sorted, `new_arr` containing the rearranged elements, and `max_beauty` holding the computed sum of absolute differences. **
