Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string representations of numbers.
   - The loop has stopped because one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len(tab))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `len(tab)` function will return the number of elements in the list `tab`.
   - According to the initial state, `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string representations of numbers.
   - The loop has stopped, and one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true. This means:
     - If `n == 0`, the loop could have stopped.
     - If `k == 0`, the loop could have stopped.
     - If `rep == 60`, the loop could have stopped.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If the loop stopped because `rep == 60`, then `tab` must contain exactly 60 elements.
   - If the loop stopped because `n == 0` or `k == 0`, then `tab` could contain any number of elements from 0 to 59.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the loop has stopped and `rep` is 60 or less, the number of elements in `tab` can be any integer from 0 to 60.
   - However, the most precise description based on the given information is that `tab` contains up to 60 elements.

Therefore, the output of the `print(len(tab))` statement will be the number of elements in the list `tab`, which is an integer between 0 and 60.

Output: **len(tab) (where len(tab) is an integer between 0 and 60, inclusive)**
