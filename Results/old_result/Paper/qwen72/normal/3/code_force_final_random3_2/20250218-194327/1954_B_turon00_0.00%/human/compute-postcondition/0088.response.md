Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
3. `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
4. `i` is `n-1`.
5. `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
6. `_` is incremented by 1.
7. `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
8. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is `n`.
9. If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` remains the same.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` is between 1 and `n` inclusive.
2. **Set `aa`**: This set contains the unique elements from the list `a`.
3. **Length of `aa`**:
   - If the length of `aa` is 1, it means all elements in `a` are the same.
   - If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different elements in `a`.

4. **Variables `ans` and `cnt`**:
   - If the length of `aa` is 1, `ans` is set to `n` and `cnt` is also set to `n`.
   - If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` remains the same.

### Determining the Output:
- **Case 1: Length of `aa` is 1**:
  - This means all elements in `a` are the same.
  - `ans` is set to `n`.
  - `cnt` is set to `n`.
  - The `print(ans)` statement will print `n`.

- **Case 2: Length of `aa` is greater than 1**:
  - This means there are at least two different elements in `a`.
  - `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
  - Since the initial value of `ans` is not explicitly given, we assume it is initialized to a value that is at least `n` (or a large value that will not affect the minimum calculation).
  - `cnt` remains the same, which is `n` (as it is set to `n` in the initial state).
  - Therefore, `ans` will be the minimum of its current value (which is at least `n`) and `n`, which is `n`.

### Conclusion:
In both cases, the value of `ans` will be `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n (where n is the length of the list `a`)**
