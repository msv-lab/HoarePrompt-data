Postcondition: **`N` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline`, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(start, end, value)` represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of `nums` that had the same value, and the value itself, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `ppp` is 23.**
