Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is '='.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` was `[0]`, so after appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
