Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.***
