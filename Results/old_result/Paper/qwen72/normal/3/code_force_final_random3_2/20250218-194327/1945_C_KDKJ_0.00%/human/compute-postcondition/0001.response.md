Initial State: `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0

```
func_1()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet calls the function `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine its specific behavior or any changes it might make to the program state. However, the initial state condition that `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called.**
