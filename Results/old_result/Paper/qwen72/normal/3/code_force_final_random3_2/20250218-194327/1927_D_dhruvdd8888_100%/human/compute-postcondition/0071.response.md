Postcondition: ***`s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, and the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is ignored. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `e` is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`, the state of the variables also remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
