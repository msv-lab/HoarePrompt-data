Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until `len(vx) <= 2`. After all iterations, `vx` will be a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive. The `ops` list will contain tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration. Each tuple will either be of the form `(v1, v2)` where `v2 > 0`, or of the form `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` where `v2 <= 0`. The exact values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` will depend on the function `q` and the initial size of `vx`.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will keep removing elements from the set `vx` until only 2 elements remain. The `ops` list will keep track of the operations performed during each iteration, either by recording the removal of a single element if `v2` is positive, or by recording the removal of two elements if `v2` is non-positive. The final state of `vx` will be a set with exactly 2 integers, and `ops` will be a list of tuples reflecting the sequence of operations that led to the final state of `vx`.
