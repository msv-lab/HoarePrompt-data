Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` remain unchanged; `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to its end; `ps` is now equal to `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`. If `vis[p[ps - 1] - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues execution without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
