Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer that must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]` (whichever is smaller). If `nums[1]` > `x`, `x` is updated to the value of `nums[1]` (if `nums[0]` <= 0, `x` is 0; otherwise, `x` is `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` based on the previous condition). Otherwise, `x` remains the value it had after the initial condition (0 if `nums[0]` <= 0, otherwise `nums[0]`).***
