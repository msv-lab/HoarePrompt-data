Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are the new input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and `k` must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is \(k - 2^{(p - 1)}\) and `f` must not be a power of 2, `p` is now the length of `l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` is updated to \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `f`, `p`) retain their initial values and conditions.
