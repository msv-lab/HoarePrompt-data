The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1, and `y` should start at 0.

State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
