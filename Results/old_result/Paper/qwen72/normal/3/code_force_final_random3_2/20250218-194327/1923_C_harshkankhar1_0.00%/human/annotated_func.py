#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. However, based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `c`, `q`, and a list of queries. `c` is a list of positive integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), and the list of queries is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [a1, a1 + a2, a1 + a2 + a3, ..., a1 + a2 + ... + an] (where each element is the cumulative sum of the original `a` list up to that index)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list, `q` is 0, and for each pair of input integers `x` and `y` provided, the program has printed 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise it has printed 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `q`, where `n` is the length of a list `a` of positive integers and `q` is the number of queries. It then reads the list `a` and initializes a list `b` of the same length. The function computes the cumulative sum of a modified version of `a` (where each element is 1 if greater than 1, otherwise 2) and stores it in `b`. It also computes the cumulative sum of the original `a` list and prints it. For each query, which consists of two integers `x` and `y`, the function prints 'NO' if the sum of elements in `a` from index `x` to `y` is less than the corresponding sum in `b` or if `x` equals `y`; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all queries, the function concludes with the cumulative sums of `a` and `b` computed and the results of the queries printed.
