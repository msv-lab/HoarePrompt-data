Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a positive integer `t` from the user input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. It then checks the relationship between these three integers and prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each case. **
