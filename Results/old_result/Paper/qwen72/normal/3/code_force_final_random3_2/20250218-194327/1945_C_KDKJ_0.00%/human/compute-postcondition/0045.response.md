Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is the first element of the list `S[i]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`. If `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
