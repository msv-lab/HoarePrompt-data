Postcondition: ***`minn` is 1, 2, or 3. If `minn` was equal to `maxx`, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`, and `maxx` is reset to 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus the previous `minn` (which was 1, 2, or 3). `func_1` is not properly defined. `n` is an input integer greater than 1. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0, 1]`, `[0, 0, 2]`, or `[0, 0, 3]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus the previous `minn` and `0` and the previous `minn`. `i` is 2.***
