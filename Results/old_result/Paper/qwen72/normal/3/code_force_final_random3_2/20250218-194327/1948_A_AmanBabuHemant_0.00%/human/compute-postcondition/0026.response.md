Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string consisting of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains `t - 1`.
- The value of `n` remains the input integer.
- `s` is assigned the value of the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer, and `s` will be a string of `'110'` repeated that many times.
- The length of `s` will be less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` will be greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.
