The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `test_cases` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2, and `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
