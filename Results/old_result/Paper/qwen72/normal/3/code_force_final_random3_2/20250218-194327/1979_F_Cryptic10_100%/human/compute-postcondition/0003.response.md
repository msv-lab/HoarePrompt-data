To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `len(vx) > 2` is true. Let's break down the state and the condition:

- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, inclusive.
- `ops` is an empty list.

The condition `len(vx) > 2` depends on the length of the set `vx`. The set `vx` contains integers from 1 to `int(input())`, inclusive. Therefore, the length of `vx` is equal to `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, `len(vx)` must be greater than 2. This means `int(input())` must be greater than 2.

Since `int(input())` is already stated to be greater than 0, we need to adjust it to ensure it is greater than 2.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, inclusive, and `ops` is an empty list.**
