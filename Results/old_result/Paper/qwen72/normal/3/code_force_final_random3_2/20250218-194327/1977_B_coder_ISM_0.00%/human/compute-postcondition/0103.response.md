Output State: **`i` is 30, `range(30)` remains a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the binary state of the corresponding bit position in `x` (from bit position 0 to bit position 29). If the bit at position `i` of `x` is set (i.e., 1), the string `'1'` is appended to `s`; otherwise, the string `'0'` is appended to `s`. The other variables (`nalla`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged. `flag` is 0.**
