Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least 2 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` now contains the key `current_key` with the value `1`, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

The code snippet updates the value of `r_y` to be the result of `num % y`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. The specific value of `r_y` is now the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. The `current_key` tuple, which was previously defined, now contains the updated value of `r_y` along with the value of `r_x`.
