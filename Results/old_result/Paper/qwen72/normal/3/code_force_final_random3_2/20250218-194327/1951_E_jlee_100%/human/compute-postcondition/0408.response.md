Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` remains unchanged if it is greater than 0, otherwise `count` is set to 1, and `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, and `done` remains False.***
