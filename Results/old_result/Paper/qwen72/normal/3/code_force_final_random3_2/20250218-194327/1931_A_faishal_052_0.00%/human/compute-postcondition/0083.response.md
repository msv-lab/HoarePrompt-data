To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `arr` is a sorted list based on the conditions provided for `lex`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is using the `chr` function to convert a number to its corresponding character in the ASCII table.
   - The number being converted is `arr[k] + 96`.
   - `k` is 3, so `arr[k]` refers to the element at index 3 of the list `arr`.
   - The `chr` function will convert the number `arr[3] + 96` to a character. For example, if `arr[3]` is 1, then `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which corresponds to the character 'a'. Similarly, `chr(2 + 96)` is `chr(98)`, which corresponds to 'b', and so on.

4. **Determine the Value of `arr[3]`:**
   - Since `arr` is a sorted list based on some conditions provided for `lex`, we need to understand what `lex` might be. However, the exact conditions for `lex` are not provided in the initial state.
   - Without the specific conditions for `lex`, we can only assume that `arr` is a list of integers that are sorted in some order.
   - The value of `arr[3]` is the fourth element in this sorted list (since list indices start at 0).

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the character corresponding to `arr[3] + 96`.
   - Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can't determine the exact character. However, we can describe the output in terms of the value of `arr[3]`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the character corresponding to the value of `arr[3] + 96`.
   - For example, if `arr[3]` is 1, the output will be 'a'. If `arr[3]` is 2, the output will be 'b', and so on.

Output: **chr(arr[3] + 96) (where arr[3] is the fourth element in the sorted list `arr`)**
