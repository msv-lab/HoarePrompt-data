Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the new `s` is '<', `mak` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If the new `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If the new `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` remains unchanged.**
