Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 2, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is 0, and `best` is `sys.float_info.max`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `best = sys.float_info.max` updates the value of `best` to the maximum possible float value, which is `sys.float_info.max`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
