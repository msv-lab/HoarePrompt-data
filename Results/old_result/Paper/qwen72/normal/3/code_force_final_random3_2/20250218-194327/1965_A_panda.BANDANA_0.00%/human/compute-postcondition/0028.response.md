Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but reads input from standard input (stdin). It processes multiple test cases, where the first line of input specifies the number of test cases (t). Each test case includes an integer n representing the number of piles, followed by a line with n integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function then outputs to standard output (stdout) the result for each test case, which is not specified in the given information.**
