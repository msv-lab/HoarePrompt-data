Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l`, `l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, but `h` is now one index greater than `l`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is one index greater than `l`. Otherwise, `l` and `h` remain converged to the same index in `D`. `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged.**

The code `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to be equal to `mid`. Given that `mid` is equal to `l`, `h` is now also equal to `l`. Therefore, `l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, but `h` is still one index greater than `l` (since `h` was already one index greater than `l` before the update). The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
