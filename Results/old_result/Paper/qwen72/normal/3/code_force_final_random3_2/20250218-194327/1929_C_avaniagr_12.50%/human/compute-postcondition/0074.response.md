Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `k` is an input integer.
3. `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
4. `a` is an input integer.
5. The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
6. `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
7. `z` is the sum of \(1 + \left(1 \div (k - 1)\right) + \left(1 + \left(1 \div (k - 1)\right)\right) \div (k - 1) + 1\) repeated `x + 1` times.
8. `i` is `x`.
9. `a` is less than `z`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and conditions, but none of this information affects the `print` statement directly.
- The condition `a < z` is given, but it does not influence the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, or the loop counter `_`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
