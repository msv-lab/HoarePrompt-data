Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string.**

### Explanation:
- **`y`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`int(input())`**: Must still be greater than 0, as this is a precondition for the loop to execute.
- **`list_len`**: Remains a string, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`max_power`**: Remains a string, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`operational_list`**: Remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`rev_res`**: This string will contain all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string. For example, if `operational_list` contains "123" and "456", and both "321" and "654" have the same length as their original strings, then `rev_res` will be "123456".
- **`rev_val`**: This list will contain the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string. For example, if `operational_list` contains "123" and "100", and "001" (which is "1" when converted to an integer) has a different length than "100", then `rev_val` will be `["001"]`.
