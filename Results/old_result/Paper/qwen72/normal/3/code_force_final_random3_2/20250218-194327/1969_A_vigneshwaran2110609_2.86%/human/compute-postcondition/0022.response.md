Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is `x`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` remains unchanged unless the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met during the current iteration.**

The value of `x` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The variable `i` is now equal to this new value of `x`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `l`, and `flag`) remain unchanged.
