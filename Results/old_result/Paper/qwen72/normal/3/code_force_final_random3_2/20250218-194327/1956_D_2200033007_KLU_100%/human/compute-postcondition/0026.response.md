Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`, `j` is `start_index`, `arr[start_index]` is now `i`.** 

The value at the index `start_index` in the list `arr` has been updated to the value of `i`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
