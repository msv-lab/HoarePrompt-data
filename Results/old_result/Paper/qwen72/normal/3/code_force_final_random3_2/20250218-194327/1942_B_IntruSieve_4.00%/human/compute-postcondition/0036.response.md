Output State: **`maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for all `arr[i] <= 0` in the list `arr`. `func_1` is not properly defined. `n` is an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is a list containing the values `0` for each `arr[i] > 0` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each `arr[i] <= 0`. `minn` is the number of positive elements in `arr` plus 1 if the last positive element was equal to the current `minn` value. `i` is `n-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`maxx`**: This variable will store the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered for any non-positive element in the list `arr`. If there are no non-positive elements, `maxx` will remain 0.
- **`func_1`**: This variable remains undefined and is not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: This is the input integer representing the length of the list `arr`.
- **`arr`**: This is the list of integers input by the user, which remains unchanged.
- **`mex`**: This list will contain the value `0` for each positive element in `arr` and the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each non-positive element in `arr`.
- **`minn`**: This variable will be incremented by 1 for each positive element in `arr`. If the last positive element was equal to the current `minn` value, `minn` will be incremented by 1 again.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of the list `arr`.
