Output State: **_ is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` now equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is equal to the product of all integers in `arr`, `i` is the last integer in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The value of `r` is now `n - 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `n` and `m` being input integers within their respective ranges, `arr` being a list of integers, `s` being a list of characters, `res` being a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` being the product of all integers in `arr`, `i` being the last integer in `arr`, `c` being 1, and `l` being 0, are still valid.
