Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string representations of numbers, and the loop has finished executing all elements in `tab`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `rep` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `tab` still contains up to 60 string representations of numbers, but the loop has completed printing all the elements in `tab`.
