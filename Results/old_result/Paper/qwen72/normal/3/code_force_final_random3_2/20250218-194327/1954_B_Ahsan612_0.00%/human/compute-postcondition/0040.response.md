The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` which is the loop counter. The loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, but the loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer input provided by `int(input())`. The loop does not depend on any other variables in the loop head, such as `t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, or `minn`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed once, and the loop will continue to execute based on the remaining number of iterations specified by the input. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we do not need to adjust it. However, we need to ensure that the loop can still execute one more time, which means the input must be greater than the number of iterations already completed.

Given that the loop has already executed once, the input must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `same` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and the input for the loop must be greater than 1. If `minn` is `inf`, `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.**
