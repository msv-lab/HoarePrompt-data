Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `num` is the second integer in the list `nums`. If the second integer in `nums` is not equal to the first integer in `nums`, `s` is 1, `e` is 0, and `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`. Otherwise, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, and `arr` is an empty list.**
