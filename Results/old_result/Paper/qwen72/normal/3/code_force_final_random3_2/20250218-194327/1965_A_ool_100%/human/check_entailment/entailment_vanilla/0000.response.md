### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It first checks if the smallest pile size is not 1. If so, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles in one move.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1, the function then checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. This is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and checking the difference between consecutive elements.
   - If the pile sizes are not consecutive, the game can be won by the player who makes the first move that breaks the consecutive sequence. This is because the player can always choose a `k` that will leave the opponent with a non-consecutive sequence, which can be exploited to win.
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the game is essentially a Nim game with a single pile of size 1, which is a losing position for the player who is forced to make the move. Therefore, the player who is not forced to make the move (i.e., the player who can make the last move) will win.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the smallest pile size is not 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the pile sizes are consecutive correctly.
   - The program correctly alternates the winning player based on the parity of the number of non-consecutive steps.

4. **Optimality**:
   - The program assumes both players play optimally, which is a valid assumption for this problem.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the smallest pile size and the consecutive nature of the pile sizes is sound.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct winner for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It handles all the edge cases and ensures that the correct player is identified as the winner.

### Correctness:
**True**
