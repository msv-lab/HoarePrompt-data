Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

The code snippet `m = min(a)` assigns the smallest integer in the list `a` to the variable `m`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, and `_`) remain unchanged. The value of `m` is now the smallest integer in the list `a`.
