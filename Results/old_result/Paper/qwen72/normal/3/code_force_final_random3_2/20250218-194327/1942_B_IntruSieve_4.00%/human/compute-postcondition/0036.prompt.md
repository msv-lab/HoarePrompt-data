Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `maxx` is 0, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0). `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either `[0]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0), `minn` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `[0]`, `minn` is 1, and `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn` if it is greater than the current `maxx`, and `mex` contains the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1), `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1) and `0`, `minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `[0, 0]`, `minn` is 2, and `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1) if it is greater than the current `maxx`, and `mex` contains the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn` and `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1). `func_1` is not properly defined. `n` is an input integer greater than 1. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1) and `0`. `minn` is 0, 1, or 2. `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `[0, 0, abs(arr[i] - minn)]`, `minn` is 2, and `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1) if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than the current `maxx`, and `mex` contains the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn`, `0`, and `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
