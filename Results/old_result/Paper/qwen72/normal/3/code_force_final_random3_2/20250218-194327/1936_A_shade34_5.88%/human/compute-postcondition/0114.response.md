Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 1. If the new `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if the new `s` is '<', and `pans` remains an empty list if the new `s` is neither '<' nor '='. The output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0 if the new `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the new input string.***
