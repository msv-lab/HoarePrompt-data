Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop and `dp[i][j]` which is now `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`, `i` is n - 4, `j` is n - 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is `n - 4` and the value of `j` is `n - 3`.
- The rest of the `dp` list remains as it was, with elements being 0 or previously updated by the loop.
