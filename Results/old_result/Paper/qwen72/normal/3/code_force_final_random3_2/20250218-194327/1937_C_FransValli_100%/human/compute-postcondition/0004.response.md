Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `maxi` is 0.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down what each part of the `print` statement will output:

- The string `'?'` will be printed as is.
- `maxi` is 0, so the first `maxi` will print 0.
- The second `maxi` will also print 0.
- `i` is 1, so the first `i` will print 1.
- The second `i` will also print 1.

The `flush=True` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is immediately written to the console without any buffering, but it does not affect the content of the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
