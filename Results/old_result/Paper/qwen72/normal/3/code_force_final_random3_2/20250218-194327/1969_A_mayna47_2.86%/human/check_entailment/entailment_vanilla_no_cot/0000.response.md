Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Cycles and Chains:**
   - The program checks for a specific condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` to determine if the minimum number of invitations is 2. This condition is true for cycles of length 3, but it does not handle other cases correctly.
   - For example, in the second test case provided:
     - Input: `4\n2 3 4 1`
     - The program will not print 3, which is the correct answer, because it does not detect the cycle of length 4 correctly.

2. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program prints 3 for any case where the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is not met. This is not always correct. For example, if there are multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the minimum number of invitations could be 2.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program should detect cycles and chains in the friendship graph. If there is a cycle of length 2, the minimum number of invitations is 2. If there is a cycle of length greater than 2, the minimum number of invitations is the length of the smallest cycle. If there are no cycles, the minimum number of invitations is the number of friends in the largest chain.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. **Detect Cycles:**
   - Identify cycles in the friendship graph. If there is a cycle of length 2, the answer is 2.
   - If there is a cycle of length greater than 2, the answer is the length of the smallest cycle.
2. **Handle Chains:**
   - If there are no cycles, the answer is the number of friends in the largest chain.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_cycle_length(v, start, visited):
    current = start
    length = 0
    while not visited[current]:
        visited[current] = True
        current = v[current]
        length += 1
    return length

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    
    min_cycle_length = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle_length = find_cycle_length(v, i, visited)
            if cycle_length < min_cycle_length:
                min_cycle_length = cycle_length
    
    if min_cycle_length == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(min(3, min_cycle_length))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The function `find_cycle_length` is used to detect the length of a cycle starting from a given friend.
   - The `visited` array keeps track of which friends have been visited to avoid infinite loops.
2. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes the `visited` array and iterates through each friend to find the length of the smallest cycle.
   - If the smallest cycle length is 2, the program prints 2.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum of 3 and the smallest cycle length, ensuring that at least 2 friends come to the party.

This approach correctly handles all the given test cases and should work for any valid input as described in the problem.
