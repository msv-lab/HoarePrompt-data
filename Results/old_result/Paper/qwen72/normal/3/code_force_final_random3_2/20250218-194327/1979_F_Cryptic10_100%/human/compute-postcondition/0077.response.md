Let's break down the task step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- `ops` is a list containing tuples based on the value of `v2` for each iteration.
- `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration.
- `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`vx`**: This set contains exactly 2 integers from the range 1 to `int(input())` inclusive. Let's denote these integers as `a` and `b`.
2. **`ops`**: This is a list of tuples. Each tuple is based on the value of `v2` for each iteration. The exact structure and values of these tuples are not provided, but they are used to populate `p1` and `p2`.
3. **`p1`**: This list starts with the two integers from `vx` and is extended by `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration.
4. **`p2`**: This list is extended by `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration.
5. **`p1[::-1] + p2`**: This expression concatenates the reversed list `p1` with the list `p2`.
6. **`' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**: This converts each element in the concatenated list to a string and joins them with a space.
7. **`print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)`**: This prints the concatenated and joined string with a leading "!".

### Determining the Output:
- **`p1`**: Initially contains the two integers from `vx`. Let's say `p1 = [a, b]`.
- **`p2`**: Initially empty, but will be populated with `v1` values from `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the tuples in `ops` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the structure of the lists.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output a string starting with "!" followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order and then the elements of `p2`, all separated by spaces.

Output: **! [b] [a] [v1 values from p2] (where `a` and `b` are the two integers from `vx`, and `v1 values from p2` are the values added to `p2` based on the condition described in the initial state)**
