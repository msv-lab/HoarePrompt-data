Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `i` is the last integer in the new `s`, `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`, `r` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[-1]` which is 1, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `i` is the first integer in the new `s`, `x` is -1, `r` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[-1]` which is 1 and `b[x]` which is 1 if `x` is 25, otherwise `b[x]` is 1 and `b[-1]` remains 1; `t` is 2; `n` is an input integer greater than 2; `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive); `i` is the second integer in the new `s`; `x` is 25 if `i` is 1, otherwise `x` is -1; `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in the list `a` (if `x` is 25, `r` will be `a[25]`; if `x` is -1, `r` will be an empty string because `a[-1]` is out of bounds and will not be appended).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[-1]` which is 1 and `b[x]` which is now 2 if `x` is 25 or any other index between 0 and 24.
   - `t` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive).
   - `i` is the third integer in the new `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.
   - `r` remains the same unless `x` is 25, in which case `r` will be `a[25]` appended to the previous value of `r`.

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
