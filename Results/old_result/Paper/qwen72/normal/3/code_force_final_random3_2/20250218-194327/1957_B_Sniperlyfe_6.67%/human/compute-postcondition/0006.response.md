Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` elements where `nums[0]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` and `nums[1]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, the rest of the elements in `nums` are zeros, `k` is now `k - 2 * ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[i]` from it.
- Since `i` is 1, `nums[i]` is `nums[1]`, which is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`.
- The initial value of `k` was `k - ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`.
- After subtracting `nums[1]`, the new value of `k` is `k - 2 * ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and the list `nums` remain unchanged.
