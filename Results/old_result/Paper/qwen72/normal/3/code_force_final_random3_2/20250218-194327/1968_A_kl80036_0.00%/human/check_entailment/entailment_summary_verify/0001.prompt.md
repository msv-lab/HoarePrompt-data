You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` from the input, where `2 <= x <= 1000`, and prints the integer division of `x` by 2. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the result of `x // 2` has been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.

Let's break down the problem and the program:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We need to find \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest number that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.
   - For \( y \) to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), \( y \) should be as large as possible while still being a divisor of \( x \) or having a large GCD with \( x \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \).
   - It then prints \( y \).

3. **Evaluating the Program**:
   - The program sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \), which is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is a candidate for \( y \).
   - Let's consider the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) when \( y = x // 2 \):
     - If \( x \) is even, \( x = 2k \) for some integer \( k \), then \( y = k \). In this case, \( \gcd(x, y) = k \), and \( \gcd(x, y) + y = k + k = 2k = x \).
     - If \( x \) is odd, \( x = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \), then \( y = k \). In this case, \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + k \).

4. **Checking the Output**:
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) results in \( \gcd(x, y) + y = x \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) results in \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x // 2) \). This is not necessarily the maximum possible value, but it is a valid \( y \) and the program is allowed to output any valid \( y \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \), which is a valid \( y \) for the problem.
   - For even \( x \), it produces the maximum possible value.
   - For odd \( x \), it produces a valid \( y \) that satisfies the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it always outputs a valid \( y \) for the given \( x \), and for even \( x \), it produces the maximum possible value. For odd \( x \), it produces a valid \( y \) that satisfies the problem constraints.
