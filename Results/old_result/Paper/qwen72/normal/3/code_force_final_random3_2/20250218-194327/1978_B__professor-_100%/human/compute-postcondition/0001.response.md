To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the input integer `t`.

1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop to indicate that the loop variable itself is not used in the loop body. This variable is automatically managed by the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `_`.

2. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9
- `t` is an input integer

The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`. It must be greater than 0.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0**
