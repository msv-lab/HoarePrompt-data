Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer.
- The list `w` remains the same list of integers input by the user.
- The list `q` is now a list of length `n + 1`, where each element `q[k]` represents the number of times the integer `k` appears in the list `w`.
- The variable `j` is now `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
