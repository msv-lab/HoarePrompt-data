Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

The code snippet `array = list(range(1, n + 1))` updates the variable `array` to be a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
