Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end.**

Explanation:
- The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a min-heap in-place.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged.
- The `heap` is now a min-heap, meaning it is a binary tree where the parent node is always less than or equal to its children, and the smallest element is at the root.
