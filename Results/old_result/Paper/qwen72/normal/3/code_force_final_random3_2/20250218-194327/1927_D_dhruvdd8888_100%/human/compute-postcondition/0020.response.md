Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `num` is equal to `nums[1]`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` at the end, and `s` is 1 if `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, otherwise `arr` and `s` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` adds a new tuple to the list `arr`.
- The tuple is `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` because `i` is 2 and `num` is `nums[1]`.
- The value of `s` is 1 if `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged.
- The other variables (`i`, `N`, `num`) are not affected by this code snippet.
