Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0, `possible` is False, and the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is equal to either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**
