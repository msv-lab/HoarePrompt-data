Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, which must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False.
- Otherwise, `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, and `n > 1`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The condition `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1 is not relevant here because `count` is already greater than 0.
   - The condition `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` is checked. If `s[1]` is equal to `s[n - 2]`, `done` remains False. Otherwise, `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is exited.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])` will split the string `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j - 1]` is the substring from the start of `string` to the character before index `j - 1`.
     - `string[j - 1:]` is the substring from index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

4. **Values of `j - 1`:**
   - Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0.
   - Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` is `string[:0]`, which is an empty string.
   - `string[j - 1:]` is `string[0:]`, which is the entire string `string`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output an empty string followed by the entire input string `string`.

Output: **'' [string] (where [string] is the input string)**
