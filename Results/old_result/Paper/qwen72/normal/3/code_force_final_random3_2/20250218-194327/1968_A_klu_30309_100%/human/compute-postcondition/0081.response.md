Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it twice, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the maximum `current_sum`, and `y` is 1.** 

The value of `best_y` has been appended to the `results` list, making the `results` list contain the value of `best_y` twice. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
