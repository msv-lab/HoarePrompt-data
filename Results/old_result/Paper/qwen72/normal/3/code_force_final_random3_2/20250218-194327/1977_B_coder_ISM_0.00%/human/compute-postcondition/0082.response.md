To determine what will be printed by the `print(*s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the loop's effects step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 28 after the loop executes all 29 iterations.
- `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0.
- `s` is a list of 30 or 31 strings.
- The loop iterates through the list `s` from index 1 to `length-1` (where `length` is 30 or 31).
- For each index `i`, if `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i-1]` is '1', it sets `s[i]` to '0' and `s[i-1]` to '-1'.
- The final state of `s` will reflect all such changes that have been made throughout the 29 iterations.
- If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', the 30th element of `s` (i.e., `s[29]`) is now '1'.
- If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `s` is a list of 31 strings, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `length` is increased by 1.
- If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 strings, and `s[29]` is not '0'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from index 1 to `length-1` (29 or 30).
   - For each index `i` in this range, if `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i-1]` is '1', it sets `s[i]` to '0' and `s[i-1]` to '-1'.
   - This means that any occurrence of the pattern '1' followed by '-1' will be changed to '-1' followed by '0'.

2. **Final State of `s`**:
   - After the loop, the list `s` will have all such patterns replaced.
   - The final state of `s` will depend on the initial values of `s` and the changes made by the loop.

3. **Effect of `flag`**:
   - If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s[29]` is changed to '1'.
   - If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', a new element '1' is appended to `s`, making `s` a list of 31 strings.
   - If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 strings, and `s[29]` is not '0'.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: `flag` is 0.
  - `s` remains a list of 30 strings.
  - `s[29]` is not '0'.
  - The final state of `s` will be a list of 30 strings with all '1' followed by '-1' patterns replaced.

- **Scenario 2**: `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0'.
  - `s[29]` is changed to '1'.
  - `s` remains a list of 30 strings.
  - The final state of `s` will be a list of 30 strings with all '1' followed by '-1' patterns replaced, and `s[29]` is '1'.

- **Scenario 3**: `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0'.
  - A new element '1' is appended to `s`.
  - `s` becomes a list of 31 strings.
  - The final state of `s` will be a list of 31 strings with all '1' followed by '-1' patterns replaced, and the last element is '1'.

### Output:
- **Scenario 1**: `flag` is 0.
  - Output: **s (where s is a list of 30 strings with all '1' followed by '-1' patterns replaced, and s[29] is not '0')**

- **Scenario 2**: `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0'.
  - Output: **s (where s is a list of 30 strings with all '1' followed by '-1' patterns replaced, and s[29] is '1')**

- **Scenario 3**: `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0'.
  - Output: **s (where s is a list of 31 strings with all '1' followed by '-1' patterns replaced, and the last element is '1')**

Since the exact initial values of `s` and `flag` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `s`. However, we can describe the final state of `s` based on the given conditions.

Output: **s (where s is a list of 30 or 31 strings with all '1' followed by '-1' patterns replaced, and the last element is '1' if `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or s[29] is '1' if `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', or s[29] is not '0' if `flag` is 0)**
