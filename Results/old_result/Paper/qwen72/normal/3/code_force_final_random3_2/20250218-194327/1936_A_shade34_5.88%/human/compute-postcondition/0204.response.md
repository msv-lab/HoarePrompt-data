Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', the output buffer has been flushed, and the current input is '>'**

Explanation:
- `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n-1`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
