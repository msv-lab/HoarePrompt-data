To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
   - `nums` is a list of `n` elements where `nums[0]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` and `nums[1]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and the rest of the elements in `nums` are zeros.
   - `k` is now `k - 2 * ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
   ```
   - The loop will execute again if `i < n`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

The state of `k` and `nums` remains unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and are not modified by the loop itself.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` elements where `nums[0]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` and `nums[1]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and the rest of the elements in `nums` are zeros, `k` is now `k - 2 * ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`**
