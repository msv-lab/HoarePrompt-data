The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- `i` is 2.
- If `x % 2 == 0`, `output1` contains `[1, 2]` and `output2` contains `[x, int(x / 2)]`.
- Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3.
- `x` must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 for the loop to continue executing.
- The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, which means `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 3, or equivalently, `int(x ** 0.5)` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 3, `x` must be such that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 3**.
