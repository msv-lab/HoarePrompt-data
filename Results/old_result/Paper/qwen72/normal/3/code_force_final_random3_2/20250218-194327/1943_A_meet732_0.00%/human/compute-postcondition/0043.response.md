The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop will execute again if there is another element in the list `a` to be assigned to `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the list `a`, and `a` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 1, `i` is the second element in the list `a`.**
