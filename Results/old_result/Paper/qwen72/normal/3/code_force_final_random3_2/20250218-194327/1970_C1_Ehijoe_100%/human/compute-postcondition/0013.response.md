Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements, and `u` has been appended to `nodes[v]` again.**

The values of `u` and `v` are updated to the input integers provided. The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, and the structure of `nodes` remain unchanged.
