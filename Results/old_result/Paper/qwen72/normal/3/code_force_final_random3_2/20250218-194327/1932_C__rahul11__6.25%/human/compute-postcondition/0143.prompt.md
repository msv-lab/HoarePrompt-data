Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least `n` integers, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers, each initialized to 0, `ans` is the product of all integers in `arr`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `c` is 1, `k` is `n - 2`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `c` is increased by 1, the first element of the string `s` determines whether `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 1, or `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, `c` is increased by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is increased by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
