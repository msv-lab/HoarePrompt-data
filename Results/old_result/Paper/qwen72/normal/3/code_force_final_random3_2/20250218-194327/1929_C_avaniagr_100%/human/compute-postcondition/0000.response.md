The only objects in the loop head are the variable `s` and the list generated by `[*open(0)][1:]`. For the loop to execute, the list must contain at least one element. This means that the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least two lines (since the first line is skipped with `[1:]`).

State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, and `s` is the second line of the file.**
