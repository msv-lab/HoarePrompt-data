Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with a value of 1 (if `d.get(i)` was `None`) or the value of `d[i]` incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and the second element of `palka`, and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None` initially, or incremented by 2 if `d.get(i)` was not `None` initially. If `i` is in `pl`, `pl` remains a list containing only the first element of `palka`, and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None` initially, or incremented by 2 if `d.get(i)` was not `None` initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `d.get(i)` was `None` initially, `d[i]` is now 1. If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `pl` is a list containing the first, second, and third elements of `palka`. If `i` was in `pl` initially, `pl` remains a list containing only the first element of `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `pl` now contains the value `i` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
