To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit.
2. `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order, containing at least one element.
3. `answers` is a list containing strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. If `trumps` was not long enough to match all non-`None` ranks in `suits`, the loop would have printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned early.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`trumps` List**: Since `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order and contains at least one element, it will have at least one element to pop. However, the print statement attempts to pop two elements from `trumps`.
2. **`trump` Variable**: The variable `trump` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. We can infer that `trump` is a suit (e.g., 'H' for hearts, 'D' for diamonds, etc.), but its exact value is not provided.
3. **First Pop**: The first `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the highest rank in the `trumps` list.
4. **Second Pop**: The second `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the next highest rank in the `trumps` list, provided there are at least two elements in `trumps`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `trumps` has at least two elements, the print statement will successfully pop two elements and print them.
- **Scenario 2**: If `trumps` has only one element, the second `trumps.pop()` will raise an `IndexError` because there are no more elements to pop.

### Conclusion:
Given that the initial state specifies `trumps` contains at least one element, we need to consider the most likely scenario where `trumps` has at least two elements. If `trumps` has fewer than two elements, the code would have already printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned early, which is not the case here.

### Output:
The print statement will pop the two highest ranks from the `trumps` list and print them along with the `trump` suit. Since the exact values of the ranks and the `trump` suit are not provided, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[highest_rank]{trump} [second_highest_rank]{trump} (where [highest_rank] and [second_highest_rank] are the two highest ranks in the `trumps` list, and {trump} is the suit)**
