Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` is greater than or equal to 0. `num` is equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums[0]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1, 0, num)` at the end, and `s` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` or `s`.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 0.
- `N` remains greater than or equal to 0.
- `num` is assigned the value of `nums[0]`.
- The condition "If `nums[0]` is not equal to `num`" is always false because `num` is now equal to `nums[0]`.
- Therefore, no changes are made to `arr` or `s`.
