Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 4.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The variable `j` is explicitly given as 4.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `'4'`.
3. The `print` statement concatenates this string `'4'` with a space `' '` and another `'4'`.
4. The final string to be printed is `'4 4'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **4 4**
