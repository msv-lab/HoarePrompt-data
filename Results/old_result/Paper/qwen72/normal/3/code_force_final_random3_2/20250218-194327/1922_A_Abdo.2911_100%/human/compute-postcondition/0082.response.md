Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the variables retain their initial values. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
