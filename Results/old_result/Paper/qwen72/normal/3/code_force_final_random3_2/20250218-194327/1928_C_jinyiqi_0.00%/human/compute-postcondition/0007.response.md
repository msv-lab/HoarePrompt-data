The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`. Since `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `int(x ** 0.5)` will be at least 1 and can be up to 31622 (since the square root of 10^9 is approximately 31622.776, and it is cast to an integer).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2 and `x` must be such that `int(x ** 0.5)` is at least 2.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` and `output2` are lists, and `i` is 2. If `x % i == 0`, then `output1` contains `[1]` and `output2` contains `[x]`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
