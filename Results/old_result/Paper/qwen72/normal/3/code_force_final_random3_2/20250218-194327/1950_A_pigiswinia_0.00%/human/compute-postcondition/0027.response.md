Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, which is inconsistent with the problem description that requires processing multiple test cases with three digits a, b, and c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) for each test case, and the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 1000). The function's current definition does not match the intended functionality.**
