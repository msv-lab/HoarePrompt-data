Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n`.**

The variable `rsum` is assigned the value of `n` minus `i`. Since `i` is 0, `rsum` becomes equal to `n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
