Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. `_` is 0.
2. `n` is greater than 2.
3. `i` is 2.
4. `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided.
5. `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
6. `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is not '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is either '<' or '='.
7. `s` is the input string.

Given the print statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's analyze the values of the variables:
- `mak` is determined by the value of `s`. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 1. If `s` is not '<' or '=', `mak` is 0. If `s` is '<' or '=' during the loop execution, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<'.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `i` is 2.

Now, let's consider the possible values of `mak` and `mak2` based on the value of `s`:
- If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 1.
- If `s` is '=', then `mak` is 0 and `mak2` is 0.
- If `s` is not '<' or '=', then `mak` is 0 and `mak2` is 0.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we need to consider the general case. However, the print statement will always use the values of `mak` and `mak2` as determined by the value of `s`.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 2 [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are either 1 if `s` is '<', or 0 if `s` is not '<' or '=', or the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution if `s` is '<' or '=')**
