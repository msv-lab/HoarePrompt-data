Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is determined by finding the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. If '1' is found, `y` is the index of this occurrence in the reversed string. If '1' is not found, `y` is -1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `x` remain unchanged.
