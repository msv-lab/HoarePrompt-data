Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain integers with `m` within the range 1 to `n` and `n` within the range 1 to 200,000.
- The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, with each element being an integer within the range 1 to 10^9.
- The variable `cases` remains greater than 1.
- The variable `c` remains 1.
- The variable `na_frente` remains the first integer from the input minus 1, and it must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The variable `pos_final` remains the second integer from the input minus 2.
- The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged, with each element being an integer provided by the user.
- The variable `v` is -1 after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0.
- The variable `total` is the sum of the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for each index `i` from `na_frente` to 0.
- The variable `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all indices `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If no such `i` exists, `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`.
