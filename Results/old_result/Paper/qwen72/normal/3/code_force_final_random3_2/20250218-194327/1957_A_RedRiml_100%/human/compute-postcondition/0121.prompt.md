Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; w is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += d[j] // 3
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3. `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka` for each iteration, `w` is greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for each unique integer `j` in `palka` that appears at least 3 times, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations (which is the length of `palka`), `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they appeared, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `palka`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
