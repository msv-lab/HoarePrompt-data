Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is increased by `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`, `x` is the next value in `cnt.values()`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by `x // 4`, where `x` is the next value in `cnt.values()`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The dictionary `cnt` remains unchanged.
- The value of `x` is the next value in `cnt.values()` and is used in the calculation, but its specific value is not known, only that it is a count of an integer from the list `a`.
- The updated value of `ans` is `ans + (x // 4)`, where `x` is the specific count from `cnt.values()`.
