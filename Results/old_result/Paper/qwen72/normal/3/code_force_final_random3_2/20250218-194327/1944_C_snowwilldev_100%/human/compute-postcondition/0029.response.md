The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. The list `a` contains integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function also handles multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Output:
- Case_1: If `t` is greater than or equal to 2, or if `cnt[i]` is 0 for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the function returns the value of `i`.
- Case_2: If none of the conditions in Case_1 are met, the function returns the value of `i` as `k + 1`.
- Case_3: If none of the conditions in Case_1 and Case_2 are met, the function returns the value of `i` as `k + 2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. It returns the index `i` where either `t` is greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0. If no such index is found, it returns `k + 1`. If that condition is also not met, it returns `k + 2`.**
