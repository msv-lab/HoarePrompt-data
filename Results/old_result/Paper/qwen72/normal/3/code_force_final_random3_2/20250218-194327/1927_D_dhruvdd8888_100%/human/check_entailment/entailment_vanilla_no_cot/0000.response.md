Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Global `input` Overwrite**: The function `func_1` overwrites the built-in `input` function with `sys.stdin.readline`, which can lead to unexpected behavior if `input` is used elsewhere in the code.

2. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**: The `bisect_left` function is used to find the leftmost position where the query range `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`. However, the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` is not a valid comparison for the tuples in `arr` which are of the form `(start, end, value)`. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Query Handling**: The logic for handling the queries is flawed. The program attempts to find the first segment where the value changes, but it does not correctly handle cases where the segment boundaries do not align with the query boundaries. Specifically, the conditions for printing `-1 -1` or valid indices are not correctly implemented.

4. **Appending `-1` to `nums`**: The program appends `-1` to the `nums` array to ensure that the last segment is captured. However, this can lead to incorrect results if the last element in `nums` is also `-1` or if the query range includes the last element.

5. **Handling of `LA` and `min(eli, LA)`**: The variable `LA` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, and `min(eli, LA)` is used to access the last element of `arr`. This can lead to out-of-bounds errors if `eli` is greater than `LA`.

6. **Output Format**: The output format for the queries is not consistent. The program should always output two indices for each query, but the current logic can sometimes output `-1 -1` incorrectly.

To fix these issues, a more robust approach would be to preprocess the array to store the first and last occurrence of each value within the query range and then use this information to answer the queries efficiently. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    tc = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        queries = [tuple(map(int, data[index + 2 * i:index + 2 * i + 2])) for i in range(Q)]
        index += 2 * Q
        
        first_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        last_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        
        for i in range(N):
            if first_occurrence[nums[i]] == -1:
                first_occurrence[nums[i]] = i + 1
            last_occurrence[nums[i]] = i + 1
        
        for l, r in queries:
            found = False
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                if first_occurrence[nums[i - 1]] != last_occurrence[nums[i - 1]]:
                    j = last_occurrence[nums[i - 1]]
                    if l <= j <= r and i != j:
                        results.append(f"{i} {j}")
                        found = True
                        break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

func_1()
```

This corrected version preprocesses the array to store the first and last occurrence of each value. For each query, it checks if there is any value within the range `[l, r]` that has a different last occurrence index, ensuring that there are two different indices with different values. If such a pair is found, it prints the indices; otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.
