Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` (initially an input integer minus 1) down to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `na_frente` and `v` are both -1, as the loop iterates from `na_frente` down to -1.
- The variable `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from the initial value of `na_frente` down to 0.
- The variable `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from the initial value of `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
