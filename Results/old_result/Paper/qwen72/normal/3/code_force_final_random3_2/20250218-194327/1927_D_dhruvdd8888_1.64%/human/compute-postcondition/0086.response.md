Let's break down the initial state step by step to determine what will be printed:

1. **`s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**:
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(new l, 0, 0)`.
   - `LA` is not explicitly defined, so we assume it is the length of `arr` (i.e., `len(arr)`).
   - `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at the index `min(eli, len(arr))`.

2. **`int(input())` must be greater than 2**:
   - This indicates that the user input must be an integer greater than 2. However, this input is not directly used in the `print` statement.

3. **`l` and `r` are updated with new integers provided by the user input**:
   - `l` and `r` are new integers provided by the user, but their specific values are not given.

4. **`tc` is greater than 5**:
   - `tc` is a variable with a value greater than 5, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

5. **`ppp` is 23**:
   - `ppp` is a variable with a value of 23, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

6. **`s` is less than or equal to the new `l`**:
   - `s` must be less than or equal to the new value of `l`.

7. **`e` is greater than or equal to the new `r`**:
   - `e` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `r`.

8. **The `print` statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
   - This statement will print the integers -1 and -1, regardless of the values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `tc`, or `ppp`.

Given the above conditions, the `print` statement will always print `-1, -1` because it is explicitly defined to do so, and none of the variables or conditions affect the values being printed.

Output: **-1, -1**
