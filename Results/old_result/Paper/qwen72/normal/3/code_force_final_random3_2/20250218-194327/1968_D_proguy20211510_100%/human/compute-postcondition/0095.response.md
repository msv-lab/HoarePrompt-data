Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. **`i`**: After the loop completes all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` or `k`, whichever is smaller.
2. **`pres`**: `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`.
3. **`curr`**: `curr` is the value of `pres + paths[i-1] * (k - (i-1))` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.
4. **`ress`**: `ress` is the maximum value encountered during the loop, which is the maximum of the initial `ress` and all values of `curr` computed in each iteration.
5. **`resb`**: `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is a simple string literal: `'Draw'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will simply output the string `'Draw'`.

### Output:
Output: **Draw**
