Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`. `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `i` is `n`. `n` remains the input integer.**

### Explanation:
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` is still `n + r` because the value of `j` is not modified inside the loop.
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`_`**: The variable `_` is reset to a value less than `t` at the start of each iteration, but its final value is not relevant to the output state.
- **`sum`**: The variable `sum` accumulates the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the value of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- **`r`**: The variable `r` is updated to the last value of `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.
- **`i`**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, so after the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` (but since `i` is not used outside the loop, we can consider it as `n` for the final output state).
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer because it is not modified inside the loop.
