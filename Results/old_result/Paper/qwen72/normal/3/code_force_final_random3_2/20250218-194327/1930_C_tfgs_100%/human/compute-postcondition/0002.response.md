To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range(n)` function, so it starts at 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0**
