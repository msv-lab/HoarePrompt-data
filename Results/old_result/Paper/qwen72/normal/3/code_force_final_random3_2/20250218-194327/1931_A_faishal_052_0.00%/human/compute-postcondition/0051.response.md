Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer and the current value of `lex` is less than or equal to 25.**

The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `lex` is less than or equal to 25. The other variables remain unchanged.
