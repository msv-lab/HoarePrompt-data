The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer, and `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0**
