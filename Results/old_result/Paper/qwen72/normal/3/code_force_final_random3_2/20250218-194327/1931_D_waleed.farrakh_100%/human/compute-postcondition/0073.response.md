Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that have appeared more than once in `arr` as the loop iterates through each element, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet initializes `freq` to an empty dictionary, which means all previous values in `freq` (if any) are reset.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `count`, and `results`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `freq` being a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` and the value is the count of these pairs is no longer valid because `freq` is now an empty dictionary.
- The value of `count` and the list `results` still hold their previous values, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
