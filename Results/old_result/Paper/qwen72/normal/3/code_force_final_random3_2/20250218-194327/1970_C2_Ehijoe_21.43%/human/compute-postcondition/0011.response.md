Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now contains the list [v, v], `nodes[v]` now contains the list [u, u]**.

The code `nodes[v].append(u)` adds the integer `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Since `nodes[v]` initially contained the list `[u]`, after the code execution, `nodes[v]` now contains the list `[u, u]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
