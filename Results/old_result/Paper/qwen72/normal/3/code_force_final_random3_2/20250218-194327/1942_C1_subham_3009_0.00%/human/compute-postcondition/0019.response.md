Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4 - 3\).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `x` is the second input integer.
- `y` is the third input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` elements from the original list of strings.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(x - 2)
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `x` is the second input integer.
- The expression `x - 2` will subtract 2 from the value of `x`.

### Output:
The code will print the value of `x` minus 2.
Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second input integer)**
