Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 0, the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`, and `done` is True. If `count` > 1, `count2` is equal to `count`, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.***
