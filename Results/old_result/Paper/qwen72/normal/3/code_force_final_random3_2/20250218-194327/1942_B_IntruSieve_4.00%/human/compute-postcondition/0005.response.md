The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `maxx`, `func_1`, `arr`, `mex`, and `minn` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`maxx` is 0, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0, `i` is 0**
