Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is `x + 1` + `x` // (`k - 1`), `i` is `x`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The variable `k` remains an input integer.
- The variable `x` must be at least 0, as the loop runs from 0 to `x` inclusive.
- The variable `a` remains an input integer and is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `z` is updated in each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `z` will be the sum of `x + 1` (the number of iterations) and the integer division of `x` by `k - 1`.
- The loop counter `i` will be equal to `x` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
