Output State: **The function `func_1` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. The function should take parameters to match the problem description, such as `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the permutation and array, and `a` for the array of integers. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and `a` for each test case. `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is an empty list. `minn` is 0.**
