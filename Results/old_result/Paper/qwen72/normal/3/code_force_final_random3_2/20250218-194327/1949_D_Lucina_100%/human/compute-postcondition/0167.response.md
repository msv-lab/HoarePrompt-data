Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is `nx` + `xx[2][2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by appending the value of `xx[2][2]` to it.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[2][2]`.
- Therefore, `nx` is updated to `nx` + `xx[2][2]`.
