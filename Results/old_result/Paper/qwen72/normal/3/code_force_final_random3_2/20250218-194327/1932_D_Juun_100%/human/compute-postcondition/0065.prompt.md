Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `suits` will still be a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit. `trumps` will now be a sorted list in descending order, containing the same elements as before the sorting. `answers` will still be a list containing strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. If `trumps` was not long enough to match all non-`None` ranks in `suits`, the loop will have printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned early.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `suits` will still be a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit. `trumps` will now be a sorted list in descending order, containing at least one element. `answers` will still be a list containing strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. If `trumps` was not long enough to match all non-`None` ranks in `suits`, the loop will have printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned early.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `suits` will still be a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit. `trumps` will now be a sorted list in descending order, containing at least one element. `answers` will still be a list containing strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. If `trumps` was not long enough to match all non-`None` ranks in `suits`, the loop will have printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned early.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
