Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 1.
- `n + r` must be at least 1.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `j` is greater than `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so the `print` function will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Variables:
- `n` is an input integer and remains unchanged.
- The range will generate integers from 1 to `n`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer)**
