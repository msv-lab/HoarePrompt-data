Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation:
- `current_sum` is assigned the value of `gcd_val + y`.
- Since `y` is `x - 1` and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is calculated as the sum of these two values.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, `y`, and `gcd_val` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of the value of `current_sum`.
