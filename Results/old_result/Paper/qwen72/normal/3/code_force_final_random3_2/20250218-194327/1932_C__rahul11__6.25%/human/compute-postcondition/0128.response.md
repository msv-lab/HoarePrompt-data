Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 2, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `l` is `l + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, `ans`, and `res[c]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The initial state mentions that `l` is incremented by 1, and the code snippet also increments `l` by 1, so the total increment for `l` is 2.
- The initial state also mentions that `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, which remain valid after the code execution.
