Functionality: ** The function operates in an interactive environment to process a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` as input, representing the length of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function then interacts with the environment by making queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices, p_i âŠ• p_j, is maximized. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the pairs of indices (i, j) for each test case. The function can handle up to 10^3 test cases, with each permutation length n ranging from 2 to 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^4. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the pairs of indices that maximize the XOR operation have been outputted. **
