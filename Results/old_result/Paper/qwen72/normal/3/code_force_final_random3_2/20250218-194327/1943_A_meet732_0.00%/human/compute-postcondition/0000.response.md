The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which represents the total number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
