Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln - 1`, `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the count of how many times `eta[0]` appears in `w` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of the counts of how many times each integer in `eta` appears in `w`, and `res` is the sum of `q[k] * (q[k] - 1) * (q[k] - 2) // 6` plus `q[k] * (q[k] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `k` in `eta` if `eta_ln` is not 1.***
