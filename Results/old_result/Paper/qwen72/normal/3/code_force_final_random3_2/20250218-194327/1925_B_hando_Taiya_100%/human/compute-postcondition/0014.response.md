Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum value between 0, 1, `x // i`, and 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = max(ans, x // i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum value between the current `ans` and `x // i`.
- Initially, `ans` is the maximum value between 0, 1, `x // i`, and 2.
- After executing the code, `ans` is still the maximum value between 0, 1, `x // i`, and 2, as `x // i` is already considered in the initial state.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
