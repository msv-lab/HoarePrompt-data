Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` will be an empty list, and the `answers` list will contain the strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. The `suits` dictionary will remain unchanged from its initial state, as the loop does not modify it.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is a list with at least one element for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, `answers` is a list containing at least one string in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each such suit, `suits` remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` is a list with at least one element for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, `answers` is a list containing at least two strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each such suit, `suits` remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `trumps` is a list with at least one element for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, `answers` is a list containing at least one string in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each such suit, `suits` remains unchanged




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
