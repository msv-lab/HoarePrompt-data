Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array where the beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The array can be rearranged in any way to maximize this beauty.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It calls a function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - It stores the results and prints them after processing all test cases.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It creates a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array.
   - It calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Sorting and Alternating**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are at the ends.
   - By alternating elements from the ends to the middle, the function aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements, which in turn maximizes the beauty.
   - However, the problem specifies that the beauty is the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), not the sum of absolute differences. This means the differences should not be taken as absolute values.

5. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the new array, not the sum of the absolute differences.
   - The current implementation uses `abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])`, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case: \(a = [2, 1, 3]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([3, 1, 2]\). The beauty should be \((3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 3\), not 2.
   - For the second test case: \(a = [69, 69, 69]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([69, 69, 69]\). The beauty is \(0\), which is correct.
   - For the third test case: \(a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([100, 43, 90, 54, 80]\). The beauty should be \((100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 43) + (90 - 80) = 174\), not 57.
   - For the fourth test case: \(a = [3, 4, 3, 3]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([4, 3, 3, 3]\). The beauty should be \((4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1\), which is correct.
   - For the fifth test case: \(a = [2, 1]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([2, 1]\). The beauty is \((2 - 1) = 1\), which is correct.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array because it uses absolute differences instead of the specified differences.
   - The examples provided in the problem description are not correctly handled by the program due to the incorrect calculation of beauty.

Final: **False**
