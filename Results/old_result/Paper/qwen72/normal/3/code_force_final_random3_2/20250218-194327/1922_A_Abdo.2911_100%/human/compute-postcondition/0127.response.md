Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is `n - 1`. The value of `possible` is True if at any point during the loop, either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `i` will have the value `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `possible` will be True if the loop encountered any index `i` where the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` were the same but `c[i]` was different, or where `a[i]` and `b[i]` were different and `c[i]` did not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If none of these conditions were met during any iteration, `possible` will remain False.
