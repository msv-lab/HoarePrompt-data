### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves must be even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes needed. This is because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves if you are only adding or removing one cube per move.

4. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before the function call and the conditions under which "Yes" or "No" is printed.
   - The annotations confirm that the function reads `n` and `m` correctly and applies the logic to determine if the desired number of cubes can be achieved.

### Analysis:
- The logic is correct because:
  - If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it means that the number of moves is sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes, and the moves can be balanced (i.e., the number of additions and removals can be such that the net effect is `m` cubes).
  - If `n - m` is odd or negative, it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
