Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer minus 3, `b` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `p` minus 1, `s` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `p` minus 1, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` value and the value of `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` value and the value of `a[s] * k + sp`**

Explanation:
- `k` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `k` is the input integer minus 3.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
