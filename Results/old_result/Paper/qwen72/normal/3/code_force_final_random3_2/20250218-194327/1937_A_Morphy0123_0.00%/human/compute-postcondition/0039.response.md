The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n_cases` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, the current value of `power` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power} - 1} \geq n\), and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
