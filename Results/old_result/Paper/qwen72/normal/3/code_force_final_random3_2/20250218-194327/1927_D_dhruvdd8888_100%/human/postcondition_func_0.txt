The function reads a list of integers and processes a series of queries. Each query is a tuple `(l, r)` representing a range within the list. The function outputs a pair of integers for each query, indicating the boundaries of a segment where the segment can be split into two parts such that the first part is strictly less than the second part. If no such segment exists within the query range, it outputs `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it directly prints the results of the queries. The state of the input list and the queries remains unchanged after the function execution.
