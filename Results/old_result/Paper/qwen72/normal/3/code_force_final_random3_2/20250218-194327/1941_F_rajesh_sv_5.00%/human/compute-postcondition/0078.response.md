Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `h` is one index greater than `l`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `mid_sum` is assigned the value `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is assigned the value `D[mid + 1] + f`.
- `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- `h` is one index greater than the new `l`, so it remains `l + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f`) remain unchanged.
