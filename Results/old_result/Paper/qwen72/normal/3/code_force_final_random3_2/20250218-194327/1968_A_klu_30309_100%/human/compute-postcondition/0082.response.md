Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have `t` integers, `results` is a list containing `t` integers, each being the value of `best_y` for the corresponding `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is the greatest value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the last iteration of the loop, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the greatest `max_sum` for the last `x` in `test_cases`, and `y` is 1.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains a non-negative integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The list `test_cases` contains `t` integers, each within the range 2 to 1000.
- The list `results` now contains `t` integers, where each integer is the value of `best_y` found for the corresponding integer `x` in `test_cases`.
- The variable `max_sum` holds the greatest value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `best_y` holds the value of `y` that produced the greatest `max_sum` for the last integer `x` in `test_cases`.
- The variable `y` is 1, as the inner loop always breaks after the first iteration.
