Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using a set of vertices chosen by Bessie. Given that `y` is fixed at 0, we cannot choose any additional vertices, and we are limited to the `x` vertices that Bessie has already chosen.

The key insight here is that for a set of `x` vertices in a regular polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry: any convex polygon with `x` vertices can be triangulated into `x - 2` triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements this logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads `x` distinct integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie and stores them in the list `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program prints `x - 2` for each test case, which is the correct formula to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices.

3. **Output:**
   - The output for each test case is `x - 2`, which matches the expected result based on the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases).
     - `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9` (number of sides of the polygon).
     - `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)` (number of vertices chosen by Bessie).
     - `y = 0` (no additional vertices can be chosen).

5. **No Additional Vertices:**
   - Since `y` is always 0, the program does not need to consider any additional vertices, which simplifies the problem to just using the `x` chosen vertices.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the `x` chosen vertices and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
