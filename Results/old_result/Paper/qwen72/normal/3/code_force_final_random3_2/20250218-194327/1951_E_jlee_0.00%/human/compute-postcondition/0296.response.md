Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is 0 or greater, `count2` is 0 or greater, and `done` is False.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. No variables are updated by this statement, so the initial state remains unchanged.
