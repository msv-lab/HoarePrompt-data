To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` is not empty. Given the initial state, `arr` has `len(arr)` elements, which means it is not empty. However, the loop head does not specify the initial value of `num`, but it will be set to the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for num in arr:`.
2. The loop will execute if `arr` is not empty.
3. The initial state indicates that `arr` has `len(arr)` elements, which means it is not empty.
4. The initial value of `num` will be the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `num` is the first element of `arr` and `arr` is not empty.

State: **`arr` is a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
