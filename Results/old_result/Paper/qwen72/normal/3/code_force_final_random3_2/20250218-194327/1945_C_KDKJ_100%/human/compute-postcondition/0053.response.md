Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains -1 or 1 based on the initial conditions.***
