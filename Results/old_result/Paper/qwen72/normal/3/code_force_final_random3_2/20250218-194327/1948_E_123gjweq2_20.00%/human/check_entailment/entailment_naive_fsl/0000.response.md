Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the edge cases and the logic for generating the cliques is flawed. Specifically, the function `make_array` is not defined in the scope of `func_1`, which will cause a runtime error when the program is executed. Additionally, the logic for assigning elements to the array and determining the cliques does not seem to follow the problem description accurately, especially in how it handles the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

For example, consider the input:
```
2 3
```
The program should output:
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
However, the current implementation will not produce this output due to the undefined `make_array` function and incorrect logic for generating the cliques.
