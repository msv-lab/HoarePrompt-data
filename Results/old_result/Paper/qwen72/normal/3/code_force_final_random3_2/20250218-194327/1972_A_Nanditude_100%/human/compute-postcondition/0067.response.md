Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is the last list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `i` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b` up to the last element of `b`, `j` is `n-1`, and `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` up to the last element of `b`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The value of `t` is 0, as the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not hold any specific value.
- `n` is the last input integer provided by the user for the final iteration.
- `a` is the last list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, as specified in the initial state.
- `b` is the last list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, as specified in the initial state.
- `i` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b` up to the last element of `b`.
- `j` is `n-1`, indicating that the inner loop has completed all its iterations.
- `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` up to the last element of `b`. This value is printed for each iteration of the outer loop.
