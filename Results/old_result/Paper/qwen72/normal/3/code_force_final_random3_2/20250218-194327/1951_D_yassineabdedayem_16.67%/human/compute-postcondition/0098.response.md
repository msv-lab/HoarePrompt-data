Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least 3 string representations of numbers.
   - `i` is the third element of `tab`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `tab` is a list with at least 3 string representations of numbers.
   - `i` is the third element of `tab`, which means `i` is `tab[2]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).

Since `i` is the third element of `tab`, and `tab` contains string representations of numbers, the output will be the third string representation of a number in the list `tab`.

Output: **[third element of tab] (where the third element of tab is a string representation of a number)**
