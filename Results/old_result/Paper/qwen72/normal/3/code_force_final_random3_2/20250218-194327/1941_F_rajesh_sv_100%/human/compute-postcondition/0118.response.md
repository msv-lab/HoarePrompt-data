The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. Given the constraints and relationships between `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F`, the function is expected to return a value based on these predefined lists and integers. However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, the function likely uses these variables as part of its internal logic or as global variables. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. 

To provide a clear and concise description, we need to assume that the function returns a value based on the processing of these lists and integers. Since the output is not provided, we will describe the functionality in a general way.

Functionality: **The function processes predefined sorted lists `A` and `D`, and a list `F`, along with integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and returns a value based on the internal logic involving these inputs.**
