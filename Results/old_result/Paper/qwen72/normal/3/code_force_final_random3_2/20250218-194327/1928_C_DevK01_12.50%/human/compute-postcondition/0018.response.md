Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 4, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is now a list that includes the value `q // 2`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 2 and `q // 2`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.***
