### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves a pattern where the first \( k \) people are numbered from 1 to \( k \), and the next \( k-2 \) people are numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to find how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1` with \( n + x - 2 \).
     - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1` with \( n - x \).
   - The results from `func_1` are processed to find valid \( k \) values and stored in the `output` list.
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then printed.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list.
   - It uses a loop to find divisors up to the square root of \( x \) and appends both the divisor and its corresponding pair.
   - The divisors are then combined and returned in a specific order.

4. **Validation of Conditions**:
   - The condition \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that \( n + x - 2 \) is even.
   - The condition \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that \( n - x \) is even.
   - These conditions are derived from the pattern of the settling, where the positions and numbers are related by the pattern's periodicity.

5. **Processing the Results**:
   - The program checks if the divisors \( s \) from `func_1` are even and if \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
   - This ensures that the \( k \) values are valid and fit the constraints of the problem.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( k > 1 \).
   - The program also handles the constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints and the pattern of the settling. The conditions and the processing of the results are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
