### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The key to solving this problem is understanding how the XOR operation behaves with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
   - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
   - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
   - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
   - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0\)
   - \(1 \oplus 4 = 5\), \(2 \oplus 4 = 6\), \(3 \oplus 4 = 7\)

2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes zero as often as possible.
   - The function calculates the sum of a specific transformation of the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then divides this sum by 3 to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

3. **Transformation Explanation**:
   - The transformation \(3 * (x // 2) + x \% 2 * (i < 3)\) is applied to each count \(x\) of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - \(x // 2\) gives the number of pairs of the same number, and each pair contributes 0 to the XOR.
   - \(x \% 2\) gives the remainder when \(x\) is divided by 2, which is 1 if \(x\) is odd and 0 if \(x\) is even.
   - \(i < 3\) ensures that the remainder is only considered for the first three numbers (1, 2, 3) and not for 4.

4. **Sum and Division by 3**:
   - The sum of the transformed values is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - This division by 3 is based on the observation that the XOR of three numbers (1, 2, 3) is zero, and thus, every group of three numbers can be removed to make Bob win.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the input ranges correctly (1 <= t <= 10^4 and 0 <= p_i <= 200).
   - The function reads the input and processes it as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The transformation and the division by 3 are based on the properties of the XOR operation and the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
