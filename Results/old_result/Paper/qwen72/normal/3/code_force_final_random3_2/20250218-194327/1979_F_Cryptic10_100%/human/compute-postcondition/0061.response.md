Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1` and `v2`, and `vx` must have at least 3 elements. `ops` is a list that contains tuples based on the value of `v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, where `v3` is the first integer from the set `vx` and `_` is the second integer from the set `vx`, and `v3` is removed from `vx`. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by the function `q(len(vx) - 2)`.
- The initial state conditions for `vx`, `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, but now `v1` and `v2` have specific values based on the function `q`.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
- The structure of `ops` and the lists `p1` and `p2` will be determined based on the new values of `v1` and `v2`.
