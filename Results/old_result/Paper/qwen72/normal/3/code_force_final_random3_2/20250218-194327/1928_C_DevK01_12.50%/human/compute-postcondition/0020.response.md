The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `w`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range defined by `w`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `q` is at least 4.
- `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `M` remains unchanged unless `q % i == 0`. If `q % i == 0` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `w - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the value `q // 2`. If `q % i == 0` and `i` is greater than or equal to `w - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 2 and `q // 2`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(w // 1)`, which is `w`.

Since `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `q` is at least 4, `w` must be at least 2. However, `w` must be greater than 1, and since `i` is now 3, `w` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`q` is at least 4, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `M` remains unchanged unless `q % i == 0`. If `q % i == 0` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `w - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the value `q // 2`. If `q % i == 0` and `i` is greater than or equal to `w - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 2 and `q // 2`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.**
