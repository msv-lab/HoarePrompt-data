Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = 0` sets the variable `mak` to 0, overriding its previous value. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `_`, `pans`, and `mak2`) remain unchanged, and the output buffer has already been flushed as per the initial state.
