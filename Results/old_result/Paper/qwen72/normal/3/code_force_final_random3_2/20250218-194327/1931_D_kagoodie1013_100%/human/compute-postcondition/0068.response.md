Output State: **`arr` remains a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr` processed by the loop, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element, `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have appeared before the current element in the loop, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)` and the value is the count of how many times this tuple has appeared in the loop, `results` is a list that now includes `count` as its last element.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the list `arr` remains unchanged in terms of its elements and length. The variable `num` holds the value of the last element processed by the loop. The variables `r_x` and `r_y` hold the results of the modulo operations `-num % x` and `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, respectively. The `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element. The `count` variable is the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has appeared before the current element in the loop. The `residue_map` dictionary contains each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` as keys and the count of how many times each pair has appeared as values. The `results` list now includes the final value of `count` as its last element.
