Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical issue in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the way the scores are updated in the loops does not correctly reflect the game rules as described in the problem statement.

### Issue 1: Incorrect Score Calculation
The program uses the following logic to calculate the scores:
```python
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)
```
This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the players can either stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation. Instead, it assumes that the player will always move to the next position and calculates the score based on this assumption.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
- **Bodya's starting position**: 3
- **Sasha's starting position**: 2
- **Permutation**: [4, 1, 2, 3]
- **Array a**: [7, 2, 5, 6]

**Expected Output**:
- **Bodya's score**: 10 (stays at position 3 on both turns, scoring 5 + 5)
- **Sasha's score**: 9 (moves to position 1 on the first turn, scoring 2 + 7)

**Actual Output**:
- **Bodya's score**: 10 (correct)
- **Sasha's score**: 14 (incorrect, because the program incorrectly calculates the score as if Sasha always moves)

The program incorrectly calculates Sasha's score as 14, which is not the correct score according to the game rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
