Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`, the first element of `cntl` is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is updated to the minimum of 1 and the first element of `cntl`. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
