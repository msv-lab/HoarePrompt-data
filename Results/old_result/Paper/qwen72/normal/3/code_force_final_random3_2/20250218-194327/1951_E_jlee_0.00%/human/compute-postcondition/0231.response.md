Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 4 characters.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 3.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `j`**:
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.

2. **Determine `string`**:
   - `string` is an input string, and `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 4 characters.
   - Since `s` is derived from `string` and `n` (the length of `s`) is greater than 3, `string` must have at least 4 characters.

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - The `print` statement will split `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` will print the first 2 characters of `string`.
     - `string[j:]` will print the remaining characters of `string` starting from the 3rd character (index 2).

### Example:
- Suppose `string` is "example".
  - `string[:j]` will be "ex" (the first 2 characters).
  - `string[j:]` will be "ample" (the remaining characters starting from the 3rd character).

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the first 2 characters of `string` followed by the remaining characters of `string` starting from the 3rd character.
Output: **[first 2 characters of string] [remaining characters of string starting from the 3rd character]**
