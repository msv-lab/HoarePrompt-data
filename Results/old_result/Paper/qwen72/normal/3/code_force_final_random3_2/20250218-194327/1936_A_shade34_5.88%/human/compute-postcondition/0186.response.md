Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the new `s` is '<', `mak` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. If the new `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. If the new `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.** 

The code snippet `pans.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. The initial state specifies that `pans` is a list containing `[0]` under different conditions for `s`. After appending `i`, `pans` becomes `[0, 1]` regardless of the value of `s`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
