Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and `cnt`. If `arr[0]` never changes throughout the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').**
