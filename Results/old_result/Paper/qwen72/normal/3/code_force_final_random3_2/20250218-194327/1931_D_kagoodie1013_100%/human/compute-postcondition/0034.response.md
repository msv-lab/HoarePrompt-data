Output State: **`arr` is a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`**. 

This means that the variable `r_x` is now assigned the value of the modulus operation `-num % x`, where `num` is the second element of the list `arr`. The list `arr` and the variable `num` remain unchanged.
