Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code snippet `func_1()` simply calls the function `func_1()`. Since the initial state specifies that `func_1()` has already been called, calling it again does not change any variables or the state of the program. The value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 0, and `_` remains 1. No new information or changes are introduced by this code snippet.
