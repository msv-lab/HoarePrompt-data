The code snippet `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string 'Bob' to the list `answers`. The initial state specifies that `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. After the execution, the list `answers` will contain one additional element, which is 'Bob'. The values of `i` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and the list `clues` is also not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with an additional 'Bob' appended, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
