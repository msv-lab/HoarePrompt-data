Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, and `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9. If either `a` is even or `b` is even, the condition is satisfied. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the condition is not satisfied.***
