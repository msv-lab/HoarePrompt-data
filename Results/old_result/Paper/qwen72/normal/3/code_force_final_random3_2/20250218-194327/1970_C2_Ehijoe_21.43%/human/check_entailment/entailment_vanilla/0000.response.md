### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is activated.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine the winner for each round, given that both players play optimally.

2. **Tree Representation:**
   - The tree is represented using an adjacency list stored in a `defaultdict` of lists.
   - Each node is connected to its neighbors, and the edges are bidirectional.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the distances from the starting node to all its leaf nodes.
   - It uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and collect the distances.
   - The function returns a list of distances from the starting node to its leaf nodes.
   - If the starting node is a leaf node, it returns `[0]`.
   - For each neighbor of the starting node, it recursively calculates the distances and adds 1 to each distance to account for the move to the neighbor.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and constructs the tree.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque.
   - It reads the starting node for the round.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node to all its leaf nodes.
   - It checks if any of the distances is odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins the round. Otherwise, Hermione wins the round.

5. **Optimal Play:**
   - In a tree, the player who starts the game (Ron) will win if there is at least one path from the starting node to a leaf node with an odd number of moves.
   - This is because the player who starts can always force the game to end on an odd move if such a path exists.
   - If all paths from the starting node to leaf nodes have an even number of moves, the player who starts will always be forced to make the last move, and thus lose.

6. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read correctly, and the tree is constructed using the adjacency list.
   - The starting node for the round is read correctly.
   - The output is determined based on the parity of the distances to the leaf nodes.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It correctly constructs the tree, calculates the distances to the leaf nodes, and determines the winner based on the parity of these distances.

Correctness: **True**
