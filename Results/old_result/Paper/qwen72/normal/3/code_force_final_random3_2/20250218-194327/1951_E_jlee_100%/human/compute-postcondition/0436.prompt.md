Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False. If `s.count(x) == n`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `count2` is equal to `count`, and `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `count2` is greater than `count`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1, and `done` is False if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 0, `count2` remains 0, and `done` is False if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 1. If `count` is greater than 0, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` is 1, and `done` is False if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1, `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`, and `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1, `count2` is either 2 or greater than `count`, and `done` is True, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 2. If `count` > 0: If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `count` is set to 2, `count2` is set to 0, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is not equal to `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is either 2 or greater than `count`, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count` is 0 or less, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
