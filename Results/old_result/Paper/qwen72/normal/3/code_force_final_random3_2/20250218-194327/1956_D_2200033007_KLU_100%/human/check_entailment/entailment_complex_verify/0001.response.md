### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - The function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index]` using dynamic programming.
   - It uses a dictionary `res_dict` to memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the function returns the maximum of 1 and the single element in the subarray.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it recursively computes the maximum sum by considering different splits of the subarray and the MEX value of the subarray.
   - **Issue**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX value. It uses a heuristic that is not aligned with the MEX definition. Specifically, it calculates the maximum sum based on the length of the subarray and the values of the elements, rather than the actual MEX value.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum value and then tries to backtrack to find the operations that lead to this value.
   - **Issue**: The function has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the maximum value is equal to `length ** 2`. This condition is not aligned with the MEX operation and the problem's requirements. The correct approach should involve checking the actual MEX value and the operations that lead to it.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - The function checks if the subarray is already a staircase and returns if it is.
   - If the subarray is not a staircase, it recursively transforms the subarray.
   - The function updates the subarray and appends the operation to the result list `res`.
   - **Issue**: The function does not correctly handle the MEX transformation. It updates the subarray to a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`, which is not the correct MEX value. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and the function should set all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX value, which is a fundamental part of the problem.
   - The backtracking logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly reconstruct the sequence of operations.
   - The `make_stairs` function does not correctly transform the subarray into the desired MEX values.
   - The program does not meet the problem's requirements for maximizing the sum and constructing the sequence of operations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program contains logical errors in the computation of the MEX value and the construction of the sequence of operations, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
