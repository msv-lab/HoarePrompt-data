The function `func_1` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. However, based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `c`, `q`, and a list of queries. `c` is a list of positive integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), and the list of queries is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
