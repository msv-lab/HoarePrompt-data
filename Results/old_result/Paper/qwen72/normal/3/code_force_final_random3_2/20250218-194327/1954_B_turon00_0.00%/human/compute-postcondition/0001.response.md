The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
