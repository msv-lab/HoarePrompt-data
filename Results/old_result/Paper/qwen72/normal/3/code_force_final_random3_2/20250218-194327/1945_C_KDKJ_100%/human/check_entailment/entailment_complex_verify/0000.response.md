### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the standard input. This is consistent with the problem description.
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases. It then calls `func_1` `t` times, which is also consistent with the problem description.

2. **Prefix Sum Array Construction:**
   - The prefix sum array `S` is constructed correctly. It starts with `[0, 0]` and iterates through the string `a`, updating the counts of '0's and '1's.
   - For each character `s` in `a`, if `s` is '0', it increments the count of '0's (`x`), and if `s` is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`y`). This is done by appending `[x, y]` to `S`.
   - After the loop, `S` contains `n + 1` sublists, where `S[i]` represents the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th house.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The function iterates through all possible positions for the road, from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of '0's on the left side of the road.
     - `lsum`: the total number of houses on the left side of the road.
     - `right`: the number of '1's on the right side of the road.
     - `rsum`: the total number of houses on the right side of the road.
   - It checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied. If not, it continues to the next position.
   - If the conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the position `i` if `i` is closer to `n / 2` than the current `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the road is laid before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`).
   - The program ensures that the conditions are checked for all possible positions, including these edge cases.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `|n / 2 - i|` while satisfying the conditions. If no such position is found, it prints `-1`.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- **Correctness: True.**
  - The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road.
  - The prefix sum array `S` is constructed correctly and used to efficiently check the conditions for each possible position.
  - The program handles all edge cases and ensures that the conditions are met for the left and right sides of the road.
  - The final position `ans` is updated to the closest valid position to the middle of the village, as required by the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
