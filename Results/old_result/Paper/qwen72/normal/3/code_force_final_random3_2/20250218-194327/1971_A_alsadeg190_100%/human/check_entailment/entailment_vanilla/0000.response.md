### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined without any parameters, which is appropriate for this problem since it reads input directly.
   - The first input is the number of test cases `t`, which is correctly read as an integer using `int(input())`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases:**
   - The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over the number of test cases `t`. This is correct as it ensures that the program processes each test case.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
   - Inside the loop, the program reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is a standard and correct way to read multiple integers from a single line of input.

4. **Determining Minimum and Maximum:**
   - The program checks if `x` is less than `y` using an `if` statement.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x` is not less than `y` (i.e., `x` is greater than or equal to `y`), it prints `y` followed by `x`.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case, separated by a space.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine and print the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case. The input and output handling are also correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
