Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i] < A[i+1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, and `F` is now equal to the list returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is set to `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` remains the same, `next_max_diff` is set to `max_diff`, `index` remains the same.**
