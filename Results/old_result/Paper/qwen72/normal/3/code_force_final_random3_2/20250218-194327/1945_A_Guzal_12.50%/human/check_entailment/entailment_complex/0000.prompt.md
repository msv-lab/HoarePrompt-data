Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = 0
        
        if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all `n` iterations, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be assigned the values from the input for each iteration, and `k` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop for each set of values. The loop will have executed `n` times, and `i` will be `n-1`. If `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is true for any iteration, `-1` will be printed for that iteration. Otherwise, `k` will be updated to `k + a + (b + c) // 3`, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` will be further increased by 1 for that iteration. The final value of `k` will be the sum of all the updates made during the `n` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each of the `n` test cases, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. The function then calculates and prints a value `k` based on the following rules: If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `k = a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, or `k = a + (b + c) // 3` if `(b + c) % 3 == 0`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case will have been processed and the corresponding `k` value will have been printed for each.
