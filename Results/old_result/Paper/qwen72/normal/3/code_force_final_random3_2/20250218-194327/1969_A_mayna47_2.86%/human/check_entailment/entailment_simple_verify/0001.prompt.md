You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `p` representing the best friends of each friend, and an integer `n` representing the number of friends. The list `p` should have a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` should be an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. Additionally, `n` should be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The loop has completed all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each `i` in this range, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. The program has not printed anything and has not returned.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: If `n` is 2, the function takes two parameters: a list of integers `p` representing the best friends of each friend, and an integer `n` representing the number of friends. The list `p` has a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. Additionally, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the current value of `n` is 2. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as a list of integers provided by the user. If `n` is not 2, the loop has completed all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n`, and for each `i` in this range, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. The program has not printed anything and has not returned.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Monocarp has `n` friends.
   - Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`.
   - A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the first line contains `n`, the number of friends.
   - The second line contains `n` integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n`, where `p_i` is the best friend of friend `i`.
   - The output should be the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`:
     - It reads the number of friends `n`.
     - It initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, where `v[0]` is unused and `v[1]` to `v[n]` are the best friends of friends `1` to `n`.
     - If `n == 2`, it prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come.
     - Otherwise, it iterates through each friend `i` from `1` to `n`.
     - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, which means that the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself. This indicates a cycle of length 3 or a direct mutual best friend relationship.
     - If such a cycle is found, it prints `2` and returns.
     - If no such cycle is found, it prints `3`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 2` by printing `2`.
   - For `n > 2`, the program checks for cycles of length 3 or direct mutual best friend relationships. If such a cycle is found, it prints `2` because inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure both come to the party.
   - If no such cycle is found, it prints `3` because inviting three friends will ensure at least two of them come to the party. This is because in the worst case, the friends are arranged in a way that no two friends are mutual best friends, and inviting three friends will cover at least one mutual best friend pair.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 2`.
   - For `n > 2`, the program should correctly identify cycles of length 3 or mutual best friend relationships, and it does so by checking `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and handles all the given test cases appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
