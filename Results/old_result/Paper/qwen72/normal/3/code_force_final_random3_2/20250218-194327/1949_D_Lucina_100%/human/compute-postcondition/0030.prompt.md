Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, the input is a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and the character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, and the character at the i-th row and i-th column is always '.', at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S', `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `i` is 1, `x` is the i-th string from the input list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the value at index 1 of the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value at index 1 of the list `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1, and the value at index 1 of the list `b` remains unchanged. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the value at index 2 of the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value at index 1 of the list `a` remains unchanged, and the value at index 2 of the list `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3. If `x[2]` is 'F', then the value at index `i` of the list `a` is incremented by 1, and the value at index 3 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. If `x[2]` is 'S', then `b[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
