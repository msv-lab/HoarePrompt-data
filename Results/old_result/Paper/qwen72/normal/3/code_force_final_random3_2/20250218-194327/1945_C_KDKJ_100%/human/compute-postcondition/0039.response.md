Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n`, `ans` is -1**

Explanation:
- `lsum` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `S`, `left`, `right`, `rsum`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
