You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case have been processed according to the conditions specified in the loop. The loop variable `_` is equal to `t - 1`, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. The conditions `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30` remain true for each processed test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the following logic: if `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`; if `n` is even and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is even and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program state is such that all test cases have been processed and their respective results have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it means buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper. The program calculates the cost for `n // 2` pairs and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`a`), resulting in `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even, the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it means buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper. The program calculates the cost for `n // 2` pairs, resulting in `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost calculated.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `2 * 5 = 10` (but the correct output should be `9` because `b` is cheaper for two yogurts).
  - **Correct Output**: `9`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `3 * 5 = 15` (but the correct output should be `14` because buying two yogurts at `b` and one at `a` is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `14`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `3 * 5 = 15` (correct because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `15`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `4 * 5 = 20` (correct because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `20`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is even and `n` is odd. However, there is a logical error in the odd case where it should always consider the promotion price for pairs and then add the cost of the single yogurt.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program does not always produce the correct minimum cost for odd values of `n`. The corrected program ensures that the promotion price is always considered for pairs, and the single yogurt is added separately if `n` is odd.
