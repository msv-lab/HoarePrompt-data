Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function sorts the unique elements of the array and then computes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The purpose of this function is not clear from the problem description, and it does not seem to be used in a way that helps determine the winner of the game.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to determine the winner based on the number of piles and the first element of the sorted unique array.
   - However, the logic is flawed. The function does not correctly handle the game's rules, especially for more than two piles.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles and the smallest pile size. The key observation is that if the number of piles is odd, Alice can always win by playing optimally. If the number of piles is even, Bob can always win by playing optimally.

### Correct Solution:
```python
def determine_winner(n, piles):
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return "Alice"
    else:
        return "Bob"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(determine_winner(n, piles))
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Function `determine_winner`**:
  - If the number of piles `n` is odd, Alice wins.
  - If the number of piles `n` is even, Bob wins.
- **Main Program**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, reads the number of piles `n` and the pile sizes.
  - Calls `determine_winner` to print the winner for each test case.

This solution correctly handles the game's rules and determines the winner based on the parity of the number of piles.
