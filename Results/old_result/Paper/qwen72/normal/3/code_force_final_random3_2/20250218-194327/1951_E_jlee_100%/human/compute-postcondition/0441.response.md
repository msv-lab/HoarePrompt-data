The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of strings `s`. The integer `t` has a constraint of 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each string in the list `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters with a length constraint of 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Since the output is not specified, I will assume the function returns some result based on the input parameters. However, without specific output details, I can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `s`. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `t` and the strings in `s`.**
