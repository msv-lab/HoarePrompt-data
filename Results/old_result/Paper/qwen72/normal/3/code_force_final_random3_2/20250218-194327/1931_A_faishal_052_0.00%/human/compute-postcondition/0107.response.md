`lex` is decremented by 1. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, it is now an integer between 1 and 24. If `lex` was initially between 27 and 51, it is now an integer between 26 and 50. If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 52, it is now an integer greater than or equal to 27. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains `[1, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 1 and 24. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 26 and 50. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 27.**
