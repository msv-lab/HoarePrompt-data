Precondition: **The function should take an integer t and a list of strings s as inputs, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and each string s consists of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. The sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def partition_non_palindromes(t, strings):
```

This function will then process t test cases, each with a string s from the list of strings.
