The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, but since `n` is already defined as an integer such that `2 <= n <= 24`, the loop will always execute at least once. However, the initial state of `i` is `n + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop. To ensure the loop executes, `i` must be set to 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24**
