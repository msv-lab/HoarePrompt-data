Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, and `ps` remain unchanged; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1; `paths` must have at least 1 element. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `curr` is now `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `ress`, `paths`, and `ps` remain unchanged. The variable `preb` is still the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`. The variable `resb` is still the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`. The variable `paths` still has at least one element. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variable `curr` is updated to the value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
