Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 1`. `i` is 2. `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is an even number but not 2, otherwise `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` if the difference is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)` appends the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`.
- Since `i` is 2, the difference `(a[2] - a[1])` is calculated and then integer division by 2 is performed.
- The value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`, regardless of whether the difference is 2 or not.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
