Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is an empty list, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration (which is currently an empty list).**

Explanation:
- `vx` is now a set of integers from 1 to the value of `int(input())` inclusive.
- `ops` is initialized as an empty list.
- The value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 2.
- `p1` remains a list containing the two integers from `vx`.
- `p2` remains a list containing all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration, but since `ops` is empty, `p2` is also an empty list.
