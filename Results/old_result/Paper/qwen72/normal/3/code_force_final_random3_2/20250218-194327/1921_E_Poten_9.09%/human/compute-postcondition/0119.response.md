Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, an additional 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2, or if the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the same value, an additional 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, and if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2, or if the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the same value, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]`, and if `clues[3] > clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and if the difference between `clues[5]` and 1 is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2, or if the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the same value, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, and if the difference between `clues[5]` and 1 minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2, or if the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the same value, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.***
