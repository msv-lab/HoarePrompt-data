Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing the value 2. If `res` is '=', `arr` now includes the value 2 as its last element.**

Explanation:
- The code `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to a new input string.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `item` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `arr` remains the same: if `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing the value 2; if `res` is '=', `arr` now includes the value 2 as its last element.
