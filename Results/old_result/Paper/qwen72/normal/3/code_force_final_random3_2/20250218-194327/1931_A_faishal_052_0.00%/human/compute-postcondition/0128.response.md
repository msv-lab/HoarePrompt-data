The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the range object `range(3)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The range object `range(3)` remains unchanged as it is a fixed sequence from 0 to 2.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list that now contains `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value**
