Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. If `count` is 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count` is not 2, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.***
