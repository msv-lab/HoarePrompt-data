Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three digits a, b, and c. The function should be called with the digits a, b, and c as arguments, and these digits must satisfy 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. Additionally, the number of test cases t must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include parameters for the digits or the number of test cases, which is inconsistent with the problem description.**

To properly reflect the problem, the function definition should be:
```
def func(t, test_cases):
```
Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three digits (a, b, c).
