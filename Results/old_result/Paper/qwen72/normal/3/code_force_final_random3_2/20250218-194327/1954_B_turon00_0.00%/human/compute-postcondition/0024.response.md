Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` and `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0.** 

Explanation:
- `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` and `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` was initially 2, so it becomes 3.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` was initially 0, so it becomes 1.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged based on the initial conditions.
