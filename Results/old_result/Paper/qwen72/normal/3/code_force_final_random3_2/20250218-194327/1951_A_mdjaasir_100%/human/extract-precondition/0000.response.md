It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The problem description and the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` suggest that the function should take two parameters, `start` and `end`, which define a range of folder names to process. However, the function definition provided is `def func():`, which does not include these parameters. For the purpose of this task, I will assume the correct function definition is `def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):`.

Given this, here is the precondition:

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that start <= end, and they represent the range of folder names to be processed, where folder names are expected to be numeric.**
