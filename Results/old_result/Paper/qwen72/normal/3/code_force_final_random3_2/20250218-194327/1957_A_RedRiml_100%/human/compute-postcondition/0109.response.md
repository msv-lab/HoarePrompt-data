The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `pl`. For the loop to execute, `pl` must contain at least one element. The state of `j` will be the first element of `pl` at the start of the loop.

State: **`palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `shapes` is 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations (which is the length of `palka`), `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they appeared and must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `palka`, `j` is the first element in `pl`**
