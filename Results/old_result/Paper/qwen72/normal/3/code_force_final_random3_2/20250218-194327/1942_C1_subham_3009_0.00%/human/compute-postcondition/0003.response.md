Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is fixed at 0**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it now ranges from 0 to 10^4 - 1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
