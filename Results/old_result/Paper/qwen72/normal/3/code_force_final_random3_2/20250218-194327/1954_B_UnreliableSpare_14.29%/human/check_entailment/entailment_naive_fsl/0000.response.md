Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not composed entirely of identical elements but is still beautiful. The logic in the program checks if all elements in the array are the same and, if so, prints `-1`. However, this approach is flawed because an array can be beautiful even if not all elements are the same, as long as the condition \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) can be used to make all elements the same.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is beautiful because you can perform the operation to make it `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The program should output `1` because removing the last element (or any other element that breaks the pattern) will make the array not beautiful. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove.

Another example where the program fails is:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` is beautiful because you can perform the operation to make it `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. The program should output `3` because removing the first three elements (or any other set of three elements that breaks the pattern) will make the array not beautiful. However, the program incorrectly outputs `3` because it does not correctly handle the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove.

The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed, and it does not correctly handle all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
