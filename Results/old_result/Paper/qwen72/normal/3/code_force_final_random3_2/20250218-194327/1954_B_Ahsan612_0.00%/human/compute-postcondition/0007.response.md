The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input. For the loop to execute the first time, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `i` is 1**
