Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).** 

Explanation:
- The value of `arr` is updated to the new input string provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is recalculated as the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- The value of `y` is recalculated as the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- The value of `z` is recalculated as the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).
