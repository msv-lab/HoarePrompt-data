Postcondition: ***`ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`. `y` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` is greater than `ii`, and `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is an even number.***
