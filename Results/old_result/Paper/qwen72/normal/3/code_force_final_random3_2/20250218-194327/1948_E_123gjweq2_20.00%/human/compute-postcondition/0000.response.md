Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`.** 

The variable `small_element` is assigned the value of `left + 1`. The other variables (`left`, `right`, and `clique`) remain unchanged. The condition `left <= right` still holds, and `clique` remains a positive integer.
