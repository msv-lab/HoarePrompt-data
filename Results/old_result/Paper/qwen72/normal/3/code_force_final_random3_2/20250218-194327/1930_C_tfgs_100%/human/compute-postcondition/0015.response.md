The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a`. If `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is 0 and `a` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list.**
