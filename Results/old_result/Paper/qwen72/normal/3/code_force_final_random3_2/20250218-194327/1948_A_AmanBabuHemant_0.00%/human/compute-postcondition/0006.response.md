The value of `s` is assigned the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer. Therefore, `s` will be a string consisting of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
