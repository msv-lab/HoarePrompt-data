### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b <= a`
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
     - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
   - **Case 2**: `elif b - a >= n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which can be calculated as `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
   - **Case 3**: `else`
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - (b - a) + 1`, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is `(n - (b - a)) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

3. **Arithmetic Series Calculation**:
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series with the first term `b` and the last term `b - k + 1` is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - This formula is correctly used in the program for the second and third cases.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and calculates the maximum profit for each test case as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
