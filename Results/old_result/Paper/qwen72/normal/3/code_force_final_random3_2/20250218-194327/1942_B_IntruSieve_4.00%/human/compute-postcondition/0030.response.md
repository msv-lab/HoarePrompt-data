Output State: **`minn` is `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus the previous `minn` (which was 1, 2, or 3); `func_1` is not properly defined; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `arr` is a list of integers input by the user; `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0, 1]`, `[0, 0, 2]`, or `[0, 0, 3]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus the previous `minn` and `0` and the previous `minn`; `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`.
- The previous value of `minn` was 1, 2, or 3.
- `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus the previous `minn`.
- The other variables (`func_1`, `n`, `arr`, `mex`, `i`) remain unchanged.
