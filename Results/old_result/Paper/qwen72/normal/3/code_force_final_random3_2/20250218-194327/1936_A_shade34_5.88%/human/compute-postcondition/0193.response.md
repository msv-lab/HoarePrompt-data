Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string, `mak` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the new `s` is '<', `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If the new `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. If the new `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.**
