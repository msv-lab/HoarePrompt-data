The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to control the number of iterations. The loop is controlled by the value of `t`, and `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented again, and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0. If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` observed during the loop, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.**
