#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a dictionary representing a tree where the keys are integers (node identifiers) and the values are lists of integers (neighbors of the node). start is an integer representing the starting node, and parent is an integer or None representing the parent node of the current start node.
def func_1(nodes, start, parent):

    #State: nodes is a dictionary representing a tree where the keys are integers (node identifiers) and the values are lists of integers (neighbors of the node). start is an integer representing the starting node, and parent is an integer or None representing the parent node of the current start node. The length of the list `nodes[start]` is not 1, or if it is 1, the first element of `nodes[start]` is not equal to `parent`.
    distances = []
    for node in nodes[start]:
        if node != parent:
            distances.extend([(1 + dist) for dist in func_1(nodes, node, start)])
        
    #State: `nodes` remains a dictionary representing the tree, `start` remains the starting node, `parent` remains the parent node of the current start node, and `distances` is a list containing the values of `1 + dist` for each `dist` returned by `func_1(nodes, node, start)` for all nodes in `nodes[start]` that are not equal to `parent`.
    return distances
    #The program returns a list `distances` containing the values of `1 + dist` for each `dist` returned by `func_1(nodes, node, start)` for all nodes in `nodes[start]` that are not equal to `parent`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `nodes` representing a tree, an integer `start` representing the starting node, and an integer or `None` `parent` representing the parent node of the current starting node. It returns a list of distances from the starting node to its descendants. If the starting node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor which is its parent), the function returns a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, it returns a list containing the values of `1 + dist` for each distance `dist` from its children to their descendants, excluding the parent node. The input dictionary `nodes` and the input parameters `start` and `parent` remain unchanged after the function call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer and always equals 1, nodes is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_2():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())

        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` for each `u` and `v` input during the loop contain a list of integers representing the connected nodes.
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and contains all keys representing nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` for each `u` and `v` input during the loop contain a list of integers representing the connected nodes, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connection.
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory set to list and contains all keys representing nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` for each `u` and `v` input during the loop contain a list of integers representing the connected nodes, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connection, `moves` is the result of the function `func_1(nodes, start)`. If any element in `moves` is an odd number, the if part of the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even, and the else part of the condition is satisfied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` (which is always 1) from user input, then reads `n-1` pairs of integers representing edges in a graph and constructs an adjacency list `nodes` from these edges. It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one connection) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. The function then reads an integer `start` from user input and calls another function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. Based on the result of `func_1`, which is a list of integers `moves`, the function prints 'Ron' if any of the integers in `moves` is odd, and 'Hermione' if all integers in `moves` are even. The function does not return any value.
