Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of strings from the fourth input.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = input().split()` reads a new line of input and splits it into a list of strings.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` was a list of the first `x` integers converted from the original list of strings, but after the code execution, `arr` is now a list of strings from the new input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `arr` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
