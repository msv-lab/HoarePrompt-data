Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the final value after all iterations, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from the sequence `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, until the loop condition is met, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `vis = [0] * n` reassigns `vis` to a new list of zeros with length `n`.
- The previous value of `vis[pb - 1]` being 1 is no longer valid.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
