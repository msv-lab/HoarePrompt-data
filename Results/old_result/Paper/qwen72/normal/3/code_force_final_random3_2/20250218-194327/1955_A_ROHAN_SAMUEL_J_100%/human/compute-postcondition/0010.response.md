Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0 and even.
   - `a` is the second integer input by the user.
   - `b` is the third integer input by the user.
   - The current value of `2 * a` is less than `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * n)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `a` is provided by the user.
   - The value of `n` is provided by the user and is known to be an even integer greater than 0.
   - The condition `2 * a < b` is given, but it does not directly affect the value of `a * n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the product of `a` and `n`.
   - Since `a` and `n` are both integers, `a * n` will be an integer.

Given the initial state, the output will be the product of `a` and `n`, where `a` is the second integer input by the user and `n` is an even integer greater than 0.

Output: **a * n (where a is the second integer input by the user and n is an even integer greater than 0)**
