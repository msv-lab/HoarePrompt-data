Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60).
   - `tab` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is the second element of `tab`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `i`.
   - According to the initial state, `i` is the second element of the list `tab`.
   - Since `tab` must have at least one element, it is guaranteed to have a second element (index 1) because the precondition states that `i` is the second element of `tab`.

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `i` will be printed, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given information.

Output: **[i] (where i is the second element of the list `tab`)**
