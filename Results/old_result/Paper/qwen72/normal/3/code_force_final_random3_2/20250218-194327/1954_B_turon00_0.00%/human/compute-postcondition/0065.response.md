The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. This statement is independent of the variables and objects described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `tmp`, `aa`, `ans`, and `cnt`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **-1**
