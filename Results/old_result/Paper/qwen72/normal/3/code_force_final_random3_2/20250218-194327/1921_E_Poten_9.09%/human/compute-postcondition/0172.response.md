Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It determines the winner of a game or if it results in a draw based on the positions of two players (Alice and Bob) on a grid of dimensions `h` x `w`. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, processes each test case, and prints the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the printed results for all test cases. **
