Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 2 and at least 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` removed, `len(vx) > 1`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 1)`, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`.** 

The value of `v3` has been removed from the set `vx`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
