The only objects in the loop head are `suit` and `rank`, which are derived from the dictionary `suits`. For the loop to execute, the dictionary `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is not `None`.

State: **`suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit, and `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`**
