Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` will start from 0, `t` is 1, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `N-1`, and the current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so `t` is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
