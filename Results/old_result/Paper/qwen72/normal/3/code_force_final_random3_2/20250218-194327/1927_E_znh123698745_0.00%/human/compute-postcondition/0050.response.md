Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 3, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value of `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`.
- The initial state specifies that `answer` already contains the integers 1 and `array[-1]`.
- After appending `array[a[0]]`, `answer` now contains the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and `array[a[0]]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `array`, `i`) remain unchanged.
