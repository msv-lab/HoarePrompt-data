Based on the initial state provided:

- `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `k` is 0.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply prints the integer `-1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **-1**
