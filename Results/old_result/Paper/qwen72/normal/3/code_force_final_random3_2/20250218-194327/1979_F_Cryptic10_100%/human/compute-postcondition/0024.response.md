The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. 

- `ops` is a list that was previously defined but its initial content is not specified.
- `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 1)`, where `len(vx) - 1` is the number of elements in `vx` minus 1.
- The values of `v1` and `v2` are not changed by this code snippet.
- The length of `vx` is greater than 1, and `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v2` removed.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`int(input())` is greater than 2 and at least 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v2` removed, `len(vx) > 1`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 1)`, `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` as its last element.**
