Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0, and `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Additionally, the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
