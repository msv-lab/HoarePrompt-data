Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer and always equals 1, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` and `t` are updated from user input.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `t` are updated based on user input, where `input().split()` takes a space-separated string and converts it into a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers. The initial constraints for `n` and `t` remain valid, and the other variables (`nodes` and `start`) are not affected by this code snippet.
