Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is not relevant to the print statement).
   - If the user input is `>`, `mak` is set to `n` and `mak2` remains 0.
   - Otherwise, `mak` is either `n-1` or 0, and `mak2` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - The next two elements are `pans[mak]` and `pans[mak]`, which means the value at index `mak` in the list `pans` will be printed twice.
   - The last two elements are `pans[i]` and `pans[i]`, which means the value at index `i` in the list `pans` will be printed twice.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `mak` can be either `n` or `n-1` or 0, depending on the user input.

4. **User Input Scenarios:**
   - If the user input is `>`:
     - `mak` is `n`.
     - The print statement will output `pans[n]` and `pans[n]` twice.
     - `i` is `n + 1`, so the print statement will output `pans[n + 1]` and `pans[n + 1]` twice.
   - If the user input is not `>`:
     - `mak` is either `n-1` or 0.
     - The print statement will output `pans[n-1]` or `pans[0]` twice.
     - `i` is `n + 1`, so the print statement will output `pans[n + 1]` and `pans[n + 1]` twice.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input is `>`:
     - The output will be `? [pans[n]] [pans[n]] [pans[n + 1]] [pans[n + 1]]`.
   - If the user input is not `>`:
     - The output will be `? [pans[n-1] or pans[0]] [pans[n-1] or pans[0]] [pans[n + 1]] [pans[n + 1]]`.

Since the exact values of `pans[n]`, `pans[n-1]`, `pans[0]`, and `pans[n + 1]` are not provided, we can only describe them based on the given information.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[n + 1]] [pans[n + 1]] (where `mak` is `n` if user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` is either `n-1` or 0, and `n` is greater than 3)**
