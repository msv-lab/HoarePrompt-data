The code prints the third element of the list `mex` and ends the print statement with a space instead of a newline.

Based on the initial state:
- `mex` is a list containing at least three elements.
- `itm` is the third element of `mex`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `itm`, which is the third element of the list `mex`, followed by a space.

Output: **[third element of mex] **

For example, if `mex` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `itm` would be `3`, and the output would be:
Output: **3 **

If `mex` is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`, then `itm` would be `'c'`, and the output would be:
Output: **c **
