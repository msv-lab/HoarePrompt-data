Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `n + r` must be at least `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` remains the input integer.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`j`**: After all iterations, `j` will be the final value of the loop, which is `n + r`. This is because the loop runs from `1` to `n + r` (inclusive).
- **`n + r`**: The condition `n + r` must be at least `n + r` is always true, as the loop will run until `j` reaches `n + r`.
- **`t`**: The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: The variable `_` is reset to a value less than `t` at the start of each iteration, but its exact value is not specified and does not affect the loop's behavior.
- **`sum`**: The variable `sum` is calculated based on the conditions given. For each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. For each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`. The exact value of `sum` depends on the values of `n` and `r`.
- **`r`**: The variable `r` is updated to the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. This means `r` will be the largest integer `i` such that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is greater than `i * n`.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is set to `n` at the end of the loop, as specified in the initial state.
- **`n`**: The variable `n` remains the input integer and is not modified by the loop.

In summary, the loop will have executed `n + r` times, and the final state will reflect the values and conditions described above.
