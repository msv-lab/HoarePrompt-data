Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - Based on the value of `h`, `h1` and `time` are set as follows:
     - If `h` is '01', `h1` is set to '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '02' to '11', `h1` is set to the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '12', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (from '01' to '11') and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '00', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The print statement will concatenate `h1`, `':', `m`, `' '`, and `time` into a single string without any additional separators.
   - The value of `h1` and `time` will depend on the value of `h` as described in the initial state.
   - `m` will be the minute part of the input string `s`.

Let's consider the possible values for `h` and their corresponding `h1` and `time`:

- If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '02' to '11', `h1` is the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is the corresponding 12-hour format hour (from '01' to '11') and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
- Otherwise, `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.

Given the initial state, the output will be:

- If `h` is '01', the output will be `01:m AM`.
- If `h` is '02' to '11', the output will be `h:m AM`.
- If `h` is '12', the output will be `12:m PM`.
- If `h` is '13' to '23', the output will be `(h-12):m PM`.
- If `h` is '00', the output will be `12:m AM`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `:m`.

Since the exact value of `h` and `m` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the 12-hour format hour corresponding to h, m is the minute part of the input string s, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described)**
