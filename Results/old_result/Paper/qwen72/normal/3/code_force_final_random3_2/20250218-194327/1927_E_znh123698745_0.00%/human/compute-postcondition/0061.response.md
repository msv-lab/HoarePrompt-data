Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing only the integer 1, `a` is [1, -1], and the current value of `i` is 1, which makes `(-1) ** i` equal to -1.**
