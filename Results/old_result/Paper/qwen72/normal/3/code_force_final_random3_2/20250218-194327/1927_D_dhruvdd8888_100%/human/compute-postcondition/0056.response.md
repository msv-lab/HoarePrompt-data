Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s` > `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `s` â‰¤ `l`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or `e` is less than `r`.
   - Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, then `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`.
   - Otherwise, `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

4. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The values `-1` and `-1` are constants and do not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, or any other variables.

Output: **-1, -1**
