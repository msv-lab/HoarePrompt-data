Postcondition: ***`i` is `x`, `z` is `x + 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z` (which is `x + 1`), the function performs some operation (not specified). If `a` is less than `z`, the function performs a different operation (not specified). In both cases, `i` remains `x` and `z` remains `x + 1`.***
