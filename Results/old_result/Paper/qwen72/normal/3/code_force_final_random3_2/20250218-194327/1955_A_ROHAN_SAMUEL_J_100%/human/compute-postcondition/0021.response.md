Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input by the user.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - The conditions for `n` and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` are as follows:
     - If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds.
     - If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.
     - If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds.
     - If `n` is even and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n // 2 * b)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The expression `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
   - The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - **If `n` is even:**
     - `n // 2` will be `n / 2` (since `n` is even, the division will result in an integer).
     - The output will be `(n // 2) * b`.
   - **If `n` is odd:**
     - `n // 2` will be `(n - 1) / 2` (since `n` is odd, the division will result in the largest integer less than `n / 2`).
     - The output will be `((n - 1) // 2) * b`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The exact numerical value of the output depends on the values of `n` and `b`.
   - However, based on the precondition, we can describe the output in terms of `n` and `b`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is the user-input integer greater than 0 and b is the user-input integer)**
