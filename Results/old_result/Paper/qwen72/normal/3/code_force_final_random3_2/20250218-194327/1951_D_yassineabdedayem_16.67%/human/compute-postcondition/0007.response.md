Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be a positive integer, `k` must be a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`**

The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged. The new variables `Min` and `Max` are assigned the values of `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively. `Min` will be the smaller of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k`, while `Max` will be the larger of the integer division of `n` by `k` (converted to an integer) and `k`.
