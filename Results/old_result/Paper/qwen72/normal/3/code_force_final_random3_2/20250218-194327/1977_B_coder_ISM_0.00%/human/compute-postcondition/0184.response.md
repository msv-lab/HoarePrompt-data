Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 29.
- `length` is 30.
- `nalla` is 29.
- `t` is greater than 29.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position of the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*s)
```

### Explanation:
- The list `s` contains 30 strings, where each string is a bit from the binary representation of `x`.
- The binary representation of `x` is split into individual bits, and these bits are stored in the list `s` starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit) to the most significant bit (leftmost bit).
- The `print(*s)` statement will print all the elements of the list `s` separated by spaces.

### Output:
- Since `s` contains the binary representation of `x` split into individual bits, the output will be a sequence of 30 bits (0s and 1s) representing the binary form of `x`, starting from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

Output: **[bit_0] [bit_1] [bit_2] ... [bit_29] (where each [bit_i] is the i-th bit of the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit)**

### Example:
If `x` is 13 (binary representation: 1101), the list `s` would be:
- `s = ['1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']`

The output would be:
Output: **1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0**
