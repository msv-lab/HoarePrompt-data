Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is less than `y`.

The `print` statement will output the values of `x` and `y` as they are provided by the user, with the condition that `x` is less than `y`.

Output: **x, y (where x and y are the input integers and x is less than y)**
