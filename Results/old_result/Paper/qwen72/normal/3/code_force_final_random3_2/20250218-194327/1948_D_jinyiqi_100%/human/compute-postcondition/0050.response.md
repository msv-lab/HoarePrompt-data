Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is 0; `k` is 2; `count` is 0.** 

The value of `count` is reset to 0, and the conditions regarding `s[k]`, `s[k + j]`, and the relationship between `count` and `j` are no longer applicable since `count` is now explicitly set to 0. However, the initial conditions for `s`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
