Output State: **`shapes` is `d[j] // 3`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, `w` is greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element of `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, and the current value of `d[j]` is at least 3.**

Explanation:
- `shapes` is incremented by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3, resulting in `shapes` being `d[j] // 3`.
- The values of `_`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `j`, and `d` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `d[j]` is at least 3 still holds.
