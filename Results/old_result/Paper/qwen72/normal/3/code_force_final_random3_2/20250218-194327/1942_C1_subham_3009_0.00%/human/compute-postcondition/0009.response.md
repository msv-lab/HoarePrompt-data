Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of the first `x` integers converted from the original list of strings.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 2. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `arr` remain unchanged.
