Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 2, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 3 if `a[0]` is also equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1. `ans` is `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`.***
