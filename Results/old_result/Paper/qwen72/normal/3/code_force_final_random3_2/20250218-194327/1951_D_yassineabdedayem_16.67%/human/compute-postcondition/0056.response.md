Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, and `tab` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `tab` to an empty list, which means `tab` no longer contains any string representations of `number` values. The values of `t`, `rep`, and `number` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, but their specific values are not known. The precondition that `t` is greater than 0 remains valid.
