Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He can then try to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles. These two rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a \times (b/2)\) or \((a/2) \times b\).
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. Therefore, he cannot form a new rectangle.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the condition for forming a new rectangle: if either dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
   - The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
