Postcondition: ***`palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is an empty list, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` is `None`, `d` contains the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, `d` contains the key `i` with its value incremented by 1.***
