Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1), `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is equal to `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is equal to `a % y`, `current_pair` is equal to `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `count` is `freq[rx, ry] + 1`. Otherwise, `freq` now contains the key `current_pair` with the value 1, and `count` is 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`, otherwise `count` is `freq[rx, ry]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rx` is updated to `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, `ry`, `current_pair`, `freq`, and `count` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `rx` is calculated based on the current value of `a` and `x`.
- The initial state information about `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, `ry`, `current_pair`, `freq`, and `count` is still valid.
