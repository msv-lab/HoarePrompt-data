Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `i` is 2, `minn` is 1, `num` is the third element of `ar`.**

The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` because it is already 1 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
