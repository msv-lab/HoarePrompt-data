Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `k` was greater than 0 initially and the loop executed fully, otherwise `i` is the value at the time `k` became 0 plus 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop executed fully or the value at the time `k` became 0, `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, minus 1, `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, minus 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value of `a[s]`, `bp` is the sum of the initial `bp` and all values of `a[b]` added during the loop, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` computed during the loop, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` computed during the loop, `n` is updated to an input integer, `k` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer minus 1, `s` is updated to an input integer minus 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sp = a[s]` updates the variable `sp` to the value of the element in the list `a` at the index `s`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
