### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific sequence: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two sets of possible \( k \) values using the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate all divisors of a given number \( h \) (which is either \( n - x \) or \( n + x - 2 \)).
   - The program then filters these divisors to find valid \( k \) values that satisfy the conditions \( k \) is even and \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` performs prime factorization of \( n \) and stores the factors in a dictionary.
   - It then generates all divisors of \( n \) using a recursive generator function `generate`.
   - The generator function `generate` is correctly implemented to generate all divisors of \( n \) by iterating over the prime factors and their powers.

4. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program calculates \( h \) as \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \) and uses `func_1` to generate divisors for both values.
   - It filters the divisors to find valid \( k \) values and combines the results from both calculations.
   - The program prints the number of unique valid \( k \) values for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( x = 1 \) separately, which is correct because \( k = 2 \) is the only valid \( k \) when \( x = 1 \).
   - The program correctly filters out \( k = 1 \) by ensuring \( k \) is even and \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).

6. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The logic for generating divisors and filtering valid \( k \) values is sound.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
   - The recursive generator function `generate` is implemented correctly to produce all divisors of a given number.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
