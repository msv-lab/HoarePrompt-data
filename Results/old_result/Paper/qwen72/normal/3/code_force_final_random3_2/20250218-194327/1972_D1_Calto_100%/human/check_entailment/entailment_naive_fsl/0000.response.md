Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function `func_2` is attempting to count such pairs, but the logic is flawed.

For example, consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The expected output is 3, as the pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2) satisfy the conditions. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this case.

The program calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\), and then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`. This logic does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem description.

To verify, let's manually check the pairs for \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- For \(a = 1\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 2\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) is not a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\). (Invalid pair)
  - \(b = 3\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)

- For \(a = 2\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 3\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)

Thus, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2), which gives a total of 3 valid pairs. However, the program's logic does not correctly count these pairs, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
