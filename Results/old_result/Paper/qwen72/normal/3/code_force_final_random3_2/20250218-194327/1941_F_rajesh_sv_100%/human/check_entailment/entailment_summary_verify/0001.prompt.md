You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases by calling `func_3` and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the variable `testcases` holds the number of iterations that were executed, and `func_6` has been called `testcases` times. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases using `func_3()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` using `func_4()`.
   - It then reads the complexities of the prepared problems `A` using `func_4()`.
   - The complexities of the models `D` are read using `func_4()`, and duplicates are removed and the list is sorted.
   - The complexities of the functions `F` are read using `func_4()`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Difference:**
   - The program initializes `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` to negative infinity.
   - It iterates through the list `A` to find the largest difference between consecutive elements (`max_diff`) and the second largest difference (`next_max_diff`).
   - It also records the index of the largest difference.

3. **Binary Search for Optimal Insertion:**
   - The program identifies the left and right elements around the largest difference.
   - For each function complexity `f` in `F`, it uses binary search to find the optimal model complexity `d` to insert a new problem.
   - It calculates the potential new complexities `D[l] + f` and `D[l + 1] + f` and checks which one minimizes the imbalance.
   - The program updates the answer `ans` with the minimum possible imbalance.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - The program prints the minimum imbalance for each test case, which is the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Input Parsing:**
  - The functions `func_3()` and `func_4()` are used to read input values correctly.
  - The input parsing is consistent with the problem description.

- **Finding the Maximum Difference:**
  - The loop to find the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A` is correct.
  - The `next_max_diff` is correctly updated to ensure it is the second largest difference.

- **Binary Search for Optimal Insertion:**
  - The binary search logic is used to find the optimal position to insert a new problem.
  - The conditions for updating `l` and `h` are correct, ensuring that the optimal model complexity is found.
  - The calculation of the potential new imbalance is correct, and the program updates `ans` accordingly.

- **Output the Result:**
  - The program correctly outputs the minimum imbalance for each test case.

### Potential Issues:

- **Function 1 and Function 2:**
  - `func_1` and `wrapper` are not used in the program. They seem to be placeholders or remnants of a previous version of the code.
  - This does not affect the correctness of the program, but they can be removed for clarity.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where no new problem is added by comparing `ans` with `next_max_diff`.
  - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. The only minor issue is the presence of unused functions, which do not affect the correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
