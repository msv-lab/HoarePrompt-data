Postcondition: ***`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string and must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the third element of `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is set to the third element of `operational_list` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` remains an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the third element of `operational_list`.***
