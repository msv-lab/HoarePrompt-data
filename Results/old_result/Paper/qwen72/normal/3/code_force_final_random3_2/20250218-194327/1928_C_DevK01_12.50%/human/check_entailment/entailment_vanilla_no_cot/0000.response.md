Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided is intended to solve the problem of determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling. However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( y \)**:
   - The program calculates \( y \) as \( n + x \). However, the correct approach should be to consider the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) in the context of the repeating pattern of the settling.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a certain value, but the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` is incorrect because `w` is a floating-point number, and comparing it directly with its integer part is not reliable. Instead, it should be `if w == int(w) and w >= x - 1`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Divisors**:
   - The program adds divisors to the list `M` but does not correctly handle the case where \( k \) should be greater than 1. The divisors should be checked to ensure they are valid \( k \) values.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Adding Divisors**:
   - The logic for adding divisors to the list `M` is flawed. The program should check if the divisors are valid \( k \) values and ensure they are greater than 1.

5. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the list `L1` after converting it to a set, but the logic for determining the valid \( k \) values is incorrect, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the valid \( k \) values that fit the given constraints. The key is to understand the repeating pattern of the settling and how it affects the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    valid_ks = set()
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k - 1 and (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1 == x:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `count_valid_ks`**:
   - This function iterates over possible values of \( k \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - For each \( k \), it checks if the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) fit the pattern of the settling.
   - If they do, it adds \( k \) to the set of valid \( k \) values.
   - Finally, it returns the number of valid \( k \) values.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calls the `count_valid_ks` function and prints the result.

This corrected program should correctly determine the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.
