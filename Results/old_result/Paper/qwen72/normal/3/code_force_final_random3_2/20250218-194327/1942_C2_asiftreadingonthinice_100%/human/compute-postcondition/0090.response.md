Output State: **`y` is decreased by `i - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, plus the value of `i`. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that have an even difference greater than 2, and if the difference between `a[0] + n` and `a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` also includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the first element of `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least one element. The value of `y` is now greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `y -= i - 1` decreases the value of `y` by `i - 1`.
- Since `y` was initially greater than or equal to `i - 1`, after the operation, `y` is now greater than or equal to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
