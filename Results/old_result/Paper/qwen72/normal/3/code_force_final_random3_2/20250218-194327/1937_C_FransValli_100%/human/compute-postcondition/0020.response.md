Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0.** 

The code initializes `arr` as a list containing the integer 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.
