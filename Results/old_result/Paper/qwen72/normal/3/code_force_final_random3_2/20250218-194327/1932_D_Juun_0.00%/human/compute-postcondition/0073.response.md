The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16.
- `trump_suit` is a character from the set "CDHS".
- `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS".

The function does not return any value in Case_1 and Case_2. In Case_3, the function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 16), `trump_suit` (a character from "CDHS"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing card ranks and suits). The function does not return any value in most cases, and in one specific case, it returns `None`.**
