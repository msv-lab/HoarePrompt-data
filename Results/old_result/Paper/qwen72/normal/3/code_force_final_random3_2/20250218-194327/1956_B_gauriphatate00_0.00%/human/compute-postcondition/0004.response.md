Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is 1, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.** 

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
