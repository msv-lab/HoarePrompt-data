Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is `n`**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 50. The variable `n` must have been at least 3 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` will have the same value as `n`, because the loop iterates from 3 up to and including `n`, and `i` is incremented by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n`.
