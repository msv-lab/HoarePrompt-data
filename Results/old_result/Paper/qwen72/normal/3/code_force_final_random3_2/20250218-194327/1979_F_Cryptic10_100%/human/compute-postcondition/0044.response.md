Output State: **`vx` is a set containing more than 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1`. `ops` is an empty list. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1. `v1` and `v2` are the result of `q(len(vx) - 2)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `vx.remove(v1)` removes the integer `v1` from the set `vx`.
- The set `vx` originally contained more than 2 integers from the set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive. After removing `v1`, `vx` still contains more than 2 integers, but `v1` is no longer in the set.
- The list `ops` remains empty.
- The list `p1` still contains all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`.
- The list `p2` still contains any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
- The values of `v1` and `v2` are still the result of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, but `v1` is no longer in `vx`.
