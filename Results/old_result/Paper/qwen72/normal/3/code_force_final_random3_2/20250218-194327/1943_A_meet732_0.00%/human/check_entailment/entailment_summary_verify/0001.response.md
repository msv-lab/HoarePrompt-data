### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and increments the count of each element in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if the count of `0` in `cntl` is `0`. If so, it prints `0` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX of the final array `c` will be `0`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program initializes a variable `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is because Alice can pick at most two `0`s to maximize the score, and Bob can pick at most one `0` to minimize the score.
   - The program then iterates through the elements from `1` to `n`:
     - If the count of the current element `j` is less than `2`, it means that Bob can pick this element to prevent Alice from picking it twice.
     - The program decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last element. If either condition is true, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct MEX value for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correct Handling of MEX 0:**
  - The program correctly identifies that if `0` is not in the array, the MEX is `0`. This is a valid and necessary check.

- **Counting and Optimal Play:**
  - The program uses a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. This is an efficient way to keep track of the elements.
  - The variable `c` is initialized to `min(2, cntl[0])` to account for the fact that Alice can pick at most two `0`s and Bob can pick at most one `0`. This is a correct approach to ensure that the game is played optimally.

- **Determining the MEX:**
  - The program iterates through the elements from `1` to `n` and checks the count of each element.
  - If the count of an element `j` is less than `2`, it means that Bob can pick this element to prevent Alice from picking it twice. The program decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last element. If either condition is true, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.
  - This logic ensures that the program correctly finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
