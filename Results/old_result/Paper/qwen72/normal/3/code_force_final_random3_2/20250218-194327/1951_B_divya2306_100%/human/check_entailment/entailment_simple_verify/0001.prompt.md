You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow (1-indexed), and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It is guaranteed that `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= n`, `1 <= ratings[i] <= 10^9`, and all `ratings[i]` are distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^5`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win.
   - We can swap cow `k` with another cow once, or choose not to swap at all.
   - The matches are conducted in a specific order, and the winner of each match proceeds to the next one.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation**:
   - The program starts by calculating the number of matches cow `k` can win without any swaps.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and counts the number of consecutive wins until it encounters a cow with a higher rating.
   - This is done using the `for` loop and the `break` statement when a higher-rated cow is found.

3. **Handling the Initial Wins**:
   - If the number of wins `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means cow `k` can already win all the matches up to its position, so the program prints `wins - 1` and returns.
   - This is correct because cow `k` can only win up to `k-1` matches if it is in position `k`.

4. **Wins with Swap Calculation**:
   - If the initial wins are less than `k`, the program calculates the number of wins cow `k` can achieve if it is swapped to a different position.
   - It starts by setting `win_with_swap` to `wins + 1`, which accounts for the initial win plus one additional win after the swap.
   - It then iterates from `win_with_swap` to `k-1` to count additional wins cow `k` can achieve after the swap.
   - The loop breaks if a higher-rated cow is encountered.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.
   - The term `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is used to adjust the number of wins after the swap. It subtracts the initial wins and adds 1 if the initial wins are not zero.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where cow `k` is already in the optimal position.
   - It also handles the case where cow `k` cannot win any matches without a swap.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient as it only iterates through the list `a` a few times, which is linear in complexity.

8. **Bugs and Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly swap the positions of the cows, but it correctly simulates the effect of a swap by calculating the potential wins.
   - The logic for determining the maximum wins after a swap is correct, but the formula used in the final output might be a bit convoluted.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. However, the final output formula could be simplified for clarity.
