#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `p` representing the best friends of each friend, and an integer `n` representing the number of friends. The list `p` should have a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` should be an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. Additionally, `n` should be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The loop has completed all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each `i` in this range, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. The program has not printed anything and has not returned.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: If `n` is 2, the function takes two parameters: a list of integers `p` representing the best friends of each friend, and an integer `n` representing the number of friends. The list `p` has a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. Additionally, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the current value of `n` is 2. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as a list of integers provided by the user. If `n` is not 2, the loop has completed all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n`, and for each `i` in this range, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. The program has not printed anything and has not returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `v` from user input. It checks if `n` is 2 and prints 2 if true. Otherwise, it iterates through the list `v` and prints 2 if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` for any `i` from 1 to `n`. If neither condition is met, it prints 3. The function does not return any value.
