Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**

The value of `cnt` is set to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
