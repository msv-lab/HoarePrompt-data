Postcondition: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2` if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. Additionally, `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**
