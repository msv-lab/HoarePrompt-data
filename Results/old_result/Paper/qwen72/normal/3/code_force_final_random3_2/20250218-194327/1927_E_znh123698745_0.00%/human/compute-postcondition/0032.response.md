The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n - 1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should start from 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing only the integer 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1.**
