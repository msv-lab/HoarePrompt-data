Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`. `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `a`.
- The length of the list `a` is now `n`, and the elements of `a` are integers between 1 and `n`, inclusive.
- The list `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, meaning it meets some specific criteria (though the exact criteria are not provided, it is assumed to be valid).
- The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- The value of `tmp` is still equal to `a[0]`.
- The value of `cnt` remains the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
- The value of `ans` remains the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
