Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 4 elements, `mak` is `n` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on whether the input was '>' or not, `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, which means any buffered output is written to the console or output stream immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `_`, `pans`, `mak`, or `mak2`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the output buffer status.
