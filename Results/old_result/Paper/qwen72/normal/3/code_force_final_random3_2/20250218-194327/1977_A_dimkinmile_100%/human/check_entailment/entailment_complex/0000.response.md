Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The logic in the program checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is a non-negative even number. This is the correct approach because:

1. **Non-negative Difference**: If `n - m` is negative, it means Nikita would need to remove more cubes than he has put, which is impossible since he starts with an empty tower. Therefore, `n - m` must be non-negative.
2. **Even Difference**: Each move can either add or remove one cube. If the difference between `n` and `m` is even, it means that the number of moves to add cubes and the number of moves to remove cubes can be balanced to achieve exactly `m` cubes. If the difference is odd, it means that the number of moves cannot be balanced, and it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes.

However, there is a small issue in the program. The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it reads input inside the function. This is not a problem in itself, but it would be more idiomatic to pass the inputs as parameters to the function. However, since the problem statement and the program's comments indicate that the function is expected to read input, this is acceptable.

The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases, and the logic inside `func_1` is correct for determining whether the tower can have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
