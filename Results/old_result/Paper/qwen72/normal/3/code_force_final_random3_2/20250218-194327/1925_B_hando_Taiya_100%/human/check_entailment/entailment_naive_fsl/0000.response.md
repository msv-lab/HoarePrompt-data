Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program provided has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than the square root of `x` but still a divisor of `x`. This can result in the program missing the correct maximum balance.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
12 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- For `x = 12` and `n = 4`, the optimal way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to use difficulties `[3, 3, 3, 3]`, which gives a balance of `3`.
- However, the program only checks divisors up to the square root of `x` (which is `3` for `x = 12`), and it misses the divisor `4` which would have given the correct answer.

To fix this, the program should check all divisors of `x` up to `x` itself, not just up to the square root of `x`.
