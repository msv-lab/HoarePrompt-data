The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `factors[prime] + 1`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes)
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable
- `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `factor` is the first element in `rest`
- `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime`
- `factors[prime]` must be at least 0
- `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime` is yielded

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` must be incremented by 1 (since it is the loop variable)
- The loop condition `factors[prime] + 1` must still be greater than `_` for the loop to continue

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is now `_ + 1`
- `factors[prime]` must still be at least 0 for the loop to execute again

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime` is yielded.**
