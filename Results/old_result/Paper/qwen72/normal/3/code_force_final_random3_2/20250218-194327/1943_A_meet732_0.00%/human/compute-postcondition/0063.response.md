Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1, `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]` minus 1, and the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
