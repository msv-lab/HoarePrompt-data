The only object in the loop head is the iterable `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be an iterable with at least one element. Since the loop has already executed once, the first element has been processed, and the next element will be the second element in the iterable.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least two elements. The next `result` will be the second element in the iterable.

State: **`results` must be an iterable with at least two elements, `result` is the second element in the iterable**
