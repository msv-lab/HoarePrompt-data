Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]`, `res[1]`, `res[2]`, and `res[3]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[1]` modulo `MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L'. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[r]` modulo `MOD` where `r` is `n - 3` or `n - 1` depending on whether `s[k]` is 'L' or not, `l` is 2 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 4`, `c` is 3, `k` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1.
- If `s[k]` is 'L', `r` was initially `n - 1`, so after decrementing, `r` is now `n - 2`.
- If `s[k]` is not 'L', `r` was initially `n - 3`, so after decrementing, `r` is now `n - 4`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
