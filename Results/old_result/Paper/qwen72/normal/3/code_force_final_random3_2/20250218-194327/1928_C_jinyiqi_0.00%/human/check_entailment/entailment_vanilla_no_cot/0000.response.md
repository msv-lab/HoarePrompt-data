Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the divisors of a given number `x`, but it does not handle the case where `x` is a perfect square correctly. When `x` is a perfect square, the square root of `x` should only be added once to the list of divisors, but the current implementation adds it twice.
   - The function `func_1` should return a list of divisors, but it is not used correctly in the main logic. The function should return all divisors of `x`, not just a reversed list of divisors.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is trying to find the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` and then check if they fit the constraints. However, the logic for checking if a divisor `s` is a valid `k` is incorrect.
   - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` is not necessary. The correct condition should be checking if `s` is a valid `k` based on the problem's constraints.
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is also not correct. The correct condition should be checking if the number Vasya received (`x`) is within the valid range for the given `k`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program appends valid `k` values to the `output` list, but it does not print the final result for each test case. The `output` list should be printed or the length of the `output` list should be printed after processing each test case.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def find_divisors(x):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != x // i:
                divisors.append(x // i)
    return divisors

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    valid_ks = set()
    
    # Check for k in the form of (n + x - 2) / (2 * k - 2)
    for k in find_divisors(n + x - 2):
        if k > 1 and (n + x - 2) // k == 2 * k - 2 and (n + x - 2) % k == 0:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    # Check for k in the form of (n - x) / (2 * k - 2)
    for k in find_divisors(n - x):
        if k > 1 and (n - x) // k == 2 * k - 2 and (n - x) % k == 0:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    print(len(valid_ks))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `find_divisors`**:
   - This function correctly finds all divisors of a given number `x` and ensures that each divisor is added only once.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program finds the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
   - It then checks if each divisor `k` is greater than 1 and if the equation `(n + x - 2) // k == 2 * k - 2` or `(n - x) // k == 2 * k - 2` holds true. This ensures that `k` is a valid number for the given constraints.
   - Valid `k` values are added to a set to avoid duplicates.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
