Postcondition: ***`maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0), `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0), `minn` is 0, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `arr` is less than or equal to 0. If the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to this absolute value.***
