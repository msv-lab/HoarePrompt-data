Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` greater than 5, `minn` is the minimum value between 1 and `same`, `i` is 6, `num` is `ar[6]`.**

Explanation: The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (1) and the value of `same`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`) remain unchanged.
