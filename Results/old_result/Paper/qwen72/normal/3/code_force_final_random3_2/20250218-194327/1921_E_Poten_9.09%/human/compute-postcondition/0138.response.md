Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` is a list that includes the string 'Draw' as its last element. Otherwise, `answers` is a list that contains the string 'Bob'.***
