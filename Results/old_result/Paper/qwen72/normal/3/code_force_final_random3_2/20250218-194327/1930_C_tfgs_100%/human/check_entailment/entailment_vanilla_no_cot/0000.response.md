Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Set Operations**:
   - The problem requires inserting `a[i] + i` into a set `S` and then deleting `a[i]` from `a`. However, the program directly modifies the elements of `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element and then converting `a` to a set. This does not simulate the correct sequence of operations as described in the problem.

2. **Incorrect Construction of `b`**:
   - The program attempts to construct the array `b` by sorting the set `a` in reverse order and then filling in gaps. However, this approach does not ensure that the elements are inserted and removed in the correct order to maximize the lexicographical value of `b`.

3. **Incorrect Use of `Counter`**:
   - The `Counter` is used to track the frequency of elements in `a`, but it is not necessary for this problem. The problem can be solved by directly manipulating the set and ensuring the correct order of operations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. Simulate the operations as described: for each element `a[i]`, insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S` and remove `a[i]` from `a`.
2. After all operations, sort the set `S` in decreasing order to form the array `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    S = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        S.add(a[i] + i + 1)
    
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

This program correctly simulates the operations and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` as required.
