### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and increments the count of each element in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if the count of `0` in `cntl` is `0`. If so, it prints `0` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX of the final array `c` will be `0`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program initializes a variable `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is because Alice can pick at most two `0`s to maximize the score, and Bob can pick at most one `0` to minimize the score.
   - The program then iterates through the elements from `1` to `n`:
     - If the count of the current element `j` is less than `2`, it means that Bob can pick this element to prevent Alice from picking it twice.
     - The program decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last element. If either condition is true, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct MEX value for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
  - The program correctly identifies that if `0` is not in the array, the MEX is `0`. This is accurate based on the problem description.

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The program correctly initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`, which accounts for the fact that Alice can pick at most two `0`s and Bob can pick at most one `0`.
  - The loop that iterates from `1` to `n` correctly identifies the smallest index `j` where the count of `j` is less than `2`. This is because if the count of `j` is less than `2`, Bob can pick this element to prevent Alice from picking it twice, thus minimizing the MEX.
  - The program decrements `c` each time it finds such an element and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last element. If either condition is true, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the MEX is correctly determined based on the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4`, `0 0 1 1`
  - `cntl` after counting: `[2, 2, 0, 0]`
  - `c` is initialized to `2` (since `cntl[0]` is `2`).
  - The loop finds `1` has a count of `2`, so it continues.
  - The loop finds `2` has a count of `0`, so `c` is decremented to `1` and the loop continues.
  - The loop finds `3` has a count of `0`, so `c` is decremented to `0` and the MEX is `2`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4`, `0 1 2 3`
  - `cntl` after counting: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `c` is initialized to `1` (since `cntl[0]` is `1`).
  - The loop finds `1` has a count of `1`, so `c` is decremented to `0` and the MEX is `1`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `2`, `1 1`
  - `cntl` after counting: `[0, 2]`
  - `c` is initialized to `0` (since `cntl[0]` is `0`).
  - The program prints `0` and moves to the next test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic for determining the MEX value is sound. It ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the counts of elements and the constraints of the game.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
