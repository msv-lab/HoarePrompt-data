Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `best_y = y` assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`.
- Since `y` is `x - 1`, `best_y` is now also `x - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
