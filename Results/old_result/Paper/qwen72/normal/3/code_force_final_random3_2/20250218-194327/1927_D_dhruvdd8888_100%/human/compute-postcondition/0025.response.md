Output State: **`i` is `N + 1`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, `s` is `N`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`**

The code snippet calculates the length of the list `arr` and assigns it to `LA` after subtracting 1. The values of `i`, `num`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged.
