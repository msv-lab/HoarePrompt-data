Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1), `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is equal to `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is equal to `a % y`, `current_pair` is equal to `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `count` is `freq[rx, ry] + freq[rx, ry] + 1`. Otherwise, `count` is `freq[rx, ry] + 1` and `freq` now contains the key `current_pair` with the value 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `count += freq[rx, ry]` increments the value of `count` by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.
- If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `count` was initially `freq[rx, ry] + 1`, so after the increment, `count` becomes `freq[rx, ry] + freq[rx, ry] + 1`.
- If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `count` was initially 0, and `freq[rx, ry]` was 1, so after the increment, `count` becomes `freq[rx, ry] + 1`.
- The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
