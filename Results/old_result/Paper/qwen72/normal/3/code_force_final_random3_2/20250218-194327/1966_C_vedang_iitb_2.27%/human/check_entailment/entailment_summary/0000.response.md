### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves removing a positive integer \( k \) from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list `a` of pile sizes and returns a new list `a_new` containing the unique, sorted pile sizes.
   - Each element in `a_new` (except the first one) is modified to be the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list.
   - This transformation effectively reduces the problem to a simpler form where the pile sizes are the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function determines the winner based on the transformed list `a` and the number of unique pile sizes `n`.
   - If `n` is 1, Alice wins because she can remove all stones from the single pile.
   - If `n` is 2, Alice wins if the first element of `a` is even, otherwise Bob wins. This is because if the first element is even, Alice can always choose a \( k \) that leaves an even number of stones in the second pile, forcing Bob to lose.
   - For `n` greater than 2, the function recursively calls itself with the list `a` excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1.
   - The recursive call returns 2 (indicating Bob wins) or 1 (indicating Alice wins). If the recursive call returns 2, or if it returns 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Combining the Functions:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the pile sizes `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to transform the pile sizes.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2` to determine the winner based on the transformed list and prints the result.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The transformation in `func_1` is correct because it reduces the problem to a simpler form where the pile sizes are the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes. This transformation preserves the game's logic.
   - The recursive logic in `func_2` is correct because it handles the base cases (1 and 2 piles) correctly and uses the result of the recursive call to determine the winner for more than 2 piles. The conditions for winning are based on the optimal play strategy.
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case and prints the winner.
