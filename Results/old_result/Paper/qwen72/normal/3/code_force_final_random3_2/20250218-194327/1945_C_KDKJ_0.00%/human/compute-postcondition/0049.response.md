Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lsum` is updated to `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `left`, `right`, `rsum`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions (`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`, and `ans` is 0) are still valid.
