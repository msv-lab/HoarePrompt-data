### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the end of the array.

3. **Building the `arr` List:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and groups consecutive equal elements into tuples `(start, end, value)`.
   - Each tuple in `arr` represents a segment of the array where all elements are equal.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if a pair of different elements exists within the range `(l, r)`:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it prints the indices of the last element of the previous segment and the first element of the current segment.
     - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` because the segment covers the entire range and all elements are the same.
     - If the end of the segment is less than `N`, it prints the indices of the first element of the current segment and the first element of the next segment.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

5. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program includes a special case for `ppp == 23` where it prints the array `nums` and the query `(l, r)` if `tc > 5`. This is likely for debugging purposes and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `sys.stdin.readline`:**
  - The function `func_1()` redefines `input` to `sys.stdin.readline` inside the function, which is not necessary and can lead to confusion. It should use `sys.stdin.readline` directly or stick with the built-in `input` function.
  
- **Incorrect Logic for Query Handling:**
  - The logic for determining the indices of different elements is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for checking the segment boundaries are not correctly implemented.
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where the segment starts at `l` and ends before `r`, but there are different elements in the next segment.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly handle all query cases, especially when the segment boundaries are not straightforward.
- The special case handling for `ppp == 23` is not relevant to the problem and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has logical errors in the query handling section and does not correctly identify pairs of different elements in all cases.
