Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. Additionally, `count` is exactly 2. If the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is not '1', then the program retains the initial state. Otherwise, if the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is '1', the program also retains the initial state.**
