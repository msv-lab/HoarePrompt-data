Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
   - `arr` is `[0]` or `[1]` or `[0, 1]`.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `0` or `1`.
   - `res` is '<' or '=' or not '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - `arr[0]` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `maxi` is printed again.
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - Since `arr` can be `[0]`, `[1]`, or `[0, 1]`, let's consider each case:
     - If `arr` is `[0]`, then `arr[0]` is `0`.
     - If `arr` is `[1]`, then `arr[0]` is `1`.
     - If `arr` is `[0, 1]`, then `arr[0]` is `0`.

   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'. Since `arr` can only be `[0]`, `[1]`, or `[0, 1]`, and `res` is either '<' or not '<':
     - If `res` is not '<', `maxi` is undefined or irrelevant in this context.
     - If `res` is '<', `maxi` would be the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'. However, since `arr` can only have 1 or 2 elements, and `i` is 2, `maxi` would be 0 or 1.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `? maxi arr[0] maxi 2`.
   - Since `arr[0]` is either `0` or `1`, and `maxi` can be `0` or `1` (or undefined if `res` is not '<'), the output will depend on the specific values of `maxi` and `arr[0]`.

Given the constraints and the possible values, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where [maxi] is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', and [arr[0]] is the first element of `arr` which is either 0 or 1)**
