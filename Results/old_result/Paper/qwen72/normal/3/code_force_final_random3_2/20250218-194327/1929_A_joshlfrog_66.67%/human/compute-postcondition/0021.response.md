Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is set to the value of `nums[2]`, `x` is set to the value of `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0. If `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, `x` is updated to the value of `nums[1]`. If `nums[2]` is greater than `x`, `x` is updated to the value of `nums[2]`.**
