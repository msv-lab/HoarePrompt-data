Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a list of characters from an input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
2. The length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
3. `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 3.
4. `j` is `n // 2` (integer division of `n` by 2).
5. `k` is 2.
6. If `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 0.
7. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(count * 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `j`**:
   - `j` is calculated as `n // 2`.
   - Since `n` is at least 3, `j` will be at least 1 (for `n = 3`, `j = 1`; for `n = 4`, `j = 2`; etc.).

2. **Determine `k`**:
   - `k` is explicitly given as 2.

3. **Check the conditions for `count`**:
   - We need to check the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`.
   - `s[k]` is the element at index 2 of the list `s`.
   - `s[k + j]` is the element at index `2 + j` of the list `s`.

4. **Evaluate the conditions**:
   - If `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 3.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

5. **Determine the value of `count`**:
   - Since `count` is either 3 or 0, and it is explicitly stated that `count` is not equal to `j`, `count` cannot be `j` (which is at least 1).
   - Therefore, `count` can only be 3 or 0.

6. **Calculate `count * 2`**:
   - If `count` is 3, then `count * 2` is 6.
   - If `count` is 0, then `count * 2` is 0.

### Final Output:
- The value of `count` is determined by the conditions given. If any of the conditions are met, `count` is 3, and if none are met, `count` is 0.
- The print statement will output `count * 2`.

Output: **6 or 0 (where 6 is printed if `s[2]` is a question mark, or `s[2 + j]` is a question mark, or `s[2]` is equal to `s[2 + j]`; otherwise, 0 is printed)**
