Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of `x` and `y` minus 2. All other variables (`y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `chosen_vertices`, `ii`, and `tt`) remain unchanged. The conditions that `tt` must be greater than `ii` and that `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user are still valid.
