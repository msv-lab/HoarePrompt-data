Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9), `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9) and must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - F[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `l` is assigned the result of `bisect_right(D, left - F[0])`, which finds the index in the sorted list `D` where the first element is greater than `left - F[0]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `ans`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
