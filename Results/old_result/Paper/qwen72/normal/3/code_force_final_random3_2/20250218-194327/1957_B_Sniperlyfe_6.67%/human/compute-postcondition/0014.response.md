Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of `n` elements. Each element in the list, except the last one, is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. The last element is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 + k`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `k` is modified during the function execution but its final state is not relevant to the user. **
