Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is `n + r`.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` remains the input integer.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

3. **Calculating `r`:**
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > i \cdot n
     \]
     Dividing both sides by `n` (assuming `n > 0`):
     \[
     \frac{n + 1}{2} > i
     \]
     Therefore, `i` must be less than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).
   - The last value of `i` that satisfies this condition is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\).

4. **Calculating `sum`:**
   - For each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, the sum includes `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - For each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, the sum includes `i * n`.

5. **Iterating Over `i`:**
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.
   - For `i` from 1 to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\), the sum includes `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - For `i` from \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\) to `n`, the sum includes `i * n`.

6. **Sum Calculation:**
   - Let \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1 \).
   - The sum for the first part (where `i` is from 1 to `k`):
     \[
     \text{sum1} = k \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)
     \]
   - The sum for the second part (where `i` is from `k + 1` to `n`):
     \[
     \text{sum2} = \sum_{i=k+1}^{n} (i \cdot n)
     \]
     This can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum2} = n \cdot \sum_{i=k+1}^{n} i
     \]
     The sum of integers from `k + 1` to `n` is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=k+1}^{n} i = \frac{(n - k) \cdot (n + k + 1)}{2}
     \]
     Therefore:
     \[
     \text{sum2} = n \cdot \frac{(n - k) \cdot (n + k + 1)}{2}
     \]

7. **Total Sum:**
   - The total sum `sum` is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \text{sum1} + \text{sum2}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{sum} = k \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right) + n \cdot \frac{(n - k) \cdot (n + k + 1)}{2}
     \]

8. **Final Output:**
   - `sum` is the total sum calculated as described.
   - `n + r` is `n + \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1 \right)`.

Given the complexity of the sum calculation, let's summarize the output:

Output: **sum, n + r (where sum is the total sum of the specified conditions and r is the last value of i for which n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n, which is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\))**
