Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the construction of the sequence `nums` in the function `func_1`. The program attempts to set each element in `nums` to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k` (i.e., `2^(bit_length of k) - 1`), and then subtracts this value from `k`. This approach can lead to an incorrect distribution of values and can cause `k` to become negative, which is not allowed.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 5`. The program will set both `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` to `3` (since `3` is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `5`), and then subtract `3` from `k` twice, resulting in `k` becoming `-1`. This is incorrect because the sum of the sequence should be `5`, and the values should be non-negative.

A correct approach would be to distribute the bits in such a way that the sum is `k` and the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s. One way to achieve this is to distribute the bits across the sequence as evenly as possible, ensuring that the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    bit = 1
    while k > 0:
        if k >= bit:
            for i in range(n):
                if k >= bit:
                    nums[i] |= bit
                    k -= bit
                else:
                    break
        bit <<= 1
    return nums
```

This function iterates through each bit position, starting from the least significant bit (1), and distributes the bits across the sequence `nums` until `k` is exhausted. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.
