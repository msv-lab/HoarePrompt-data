Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2`, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2. `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` has been removed from `vx`. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `v1` is now `len(vx) - 2`. `v2` is now the second value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.**
