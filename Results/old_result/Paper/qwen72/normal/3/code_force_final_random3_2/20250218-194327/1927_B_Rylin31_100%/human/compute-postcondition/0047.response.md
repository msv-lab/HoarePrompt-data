Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
4. `i` is 2.
5. `l` is an input integer greater than 2.
6. `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except for the elements corresponding to the indices in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`.
7. `array` is a list of integers read from input.
8. `j` is the last element in `array`.
9. `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`array`**: This is a list of integers read from input. The exact values of the integers in `array` are not provided, but we know that `j` is the last element in `array`.

2. **`s`**: This is a list of `l` integers where each element is initially 0. The elements corresponding to the indices in `array` are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`. For example, if `array` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`, then `s[1]` will be incremented by 2, `s[2]` will be incremented by 1, and `s[3]` will be incremented by 1.

3. **`j`**: This is the last element in `array`. For example, if `array` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`, then `j` is 3.

4. **`ans`**: This is a string constructed by taking each element `j` in `array`, looking up the value `s[j]`, and converting `s[j] + 97` to its corresponding ASCII character. The ASCII value 97 corresponds to the character 'a'. Therefore, `s[j] + 97` will shift the character 'a' by `s[j]` positions in the ASCII table.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `array` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]` and `l` is 4 (since `array` has 4 unique indices).

- `s` will be initialized as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- After processing `array`, `s` will be `[0, 2, 1, 1]` because:
  - `1` appears 2 times, so `s[1]` is incremented by 2.
  - `2` appears 1 time, so `s[2]` is incremented by 1.
  - `3` appears 1 time, so `s[3]` is incremented by 1.

- `j` is the last element in `array`, which is 3.
- `ans` will be constructed as follows:
  - For `j = 1`, `s[1] + 97` is `2 + 97 = 99`, which corresponds to 'c'.
  - For `j = 2`, `s[2] + 97` is `1 + 97 = 98`, which corresponds to 'b'.
  - For `j = 1`, `s[1] + 97` is `2 + 97 = 99`, which corresponds to 'c'.
  - For `j = 3`, `s[3] + 97` is `1 + 97 = 98`, which corresponds to 'b'.

Therefore, `ans` will be the string `'cbcb'`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the `print(ans)` statement will print a string where each character is determined by the value of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string constructed by converting the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array` to characters, in the order they appear in `array`)**
