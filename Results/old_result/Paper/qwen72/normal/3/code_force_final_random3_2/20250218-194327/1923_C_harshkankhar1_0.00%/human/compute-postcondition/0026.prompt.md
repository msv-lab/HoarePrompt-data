You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. However, based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `c`, `q`, and a list of queries. `c` is a list of positive integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), and the list of queries is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [a1, a1 + a2, a1 + a2 + a3, ..., a1 + a2 + ... + an] (where each element is the cumulative sum of the original `a` list up to that index)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list, `q` is 0, and for each pair of input integers `x` and `y` provided, the program has printed 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise it has printed 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `c` of positive integers, a non-negative integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list of queries, each query being a tuple of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a query and is based on some computation or property of the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
