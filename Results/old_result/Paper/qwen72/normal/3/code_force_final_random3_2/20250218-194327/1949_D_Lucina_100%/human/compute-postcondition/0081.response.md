Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n`, `x` is the new input string, `a[j]` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` is incremented by 1, and if the second character of `x` is 'F', `a[j]` and `a[n]` are incremented by 1. If the second character of `x` is not 'F' and the first character of `x` is 'S', `b[j]` and `b[n]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b[1]` and `b[n]` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `a[j]` is incremented by 1, so `a[3]` is incremented by 1.
- The initial state specifies that `a[i]` is incremented by 1, and since `i` is `n`, `a[n]` is incremented by 1.
- The conditions for `x` and the increments of `a[j]`, `a[n]`, `b[j]`, and `b[n]` remain the same as specified in the initial state.
