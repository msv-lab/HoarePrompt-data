Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are the second and third integers input by the user, respectively, and `n` is an odd number. If `2 * a` is less than `b`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. Otherwise, if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.**
