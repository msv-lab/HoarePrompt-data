Postcondition: **`i` is `len(paths)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` from index 0 to `len(paths) - 1` that were processed before `k` became less than `i + 1`, `ress` is the maximum value between the initial `ress` and the values of `curr` calculated during the loop, `curr` is the last calculated value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` before the loop terminated, and `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`.**
