Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated as described. If `b[1]` is greater than 0 and `a[1]` is equal to 0, `sa` is an empty list and `sb` is a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, `sa` is a list containing `[1]` if `a[1]` is greater than 0 and `b[1]` is equal to 0, and `sb` is an empty list.***
