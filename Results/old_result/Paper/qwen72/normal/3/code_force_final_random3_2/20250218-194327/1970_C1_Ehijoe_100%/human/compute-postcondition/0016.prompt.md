Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is expected to take input through standard input, where the first line contains two integers `n` and `t`, with 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5 and `t` = 1. The next `n-1` lines contain two integers `u` and `v` each, representing edges of the tree, with 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`. The last line contains a single integer `u_1`, representing the starting node, with 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ `n`. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `n` and `t` are now integers, with `t` = 1 and `n` in the range 2 to 2×10^5. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is `True`. `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    nodes[u].append(v)
    nodes[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements, and `u` has been appended to `nodes[v]` again.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements, `u` has been appended to `nodes[v]` again, and `v` has been appended to `nodes[u]` twice.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
