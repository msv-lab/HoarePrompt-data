The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the elements from index 0 to index `n-2` are calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element of `ans` is set to \(10^9\).
