Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`N` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline`, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(start, end, value)` represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of `nums` that had the same value, and the value itself, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is 23, the variables retain their values as described in the precondition.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `ppp` remains unchanged. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. If `s` is greater than `l`, `s` retains its value or is set to 1. If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, `s` remains less than or equal to `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, `e` remains greater than or equal to `r`. If `e` is less than `r`, `e` remains less than `r`. If `e` is less than `N`, `e` remains less than `N`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, `e` remains greater than or equal to `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`, `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains greater than or equal to `r`. If `s` is greater than `l`, the postcondition remains the same as described. If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, `e` remains less than `N` if it was originally less than `N`, and remains greater than or equal to `N` if it was originally greater than or equal to `N`. `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(l, 0, 0)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `l` and `r` are updated with new integers provided by the user input, `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is 23, `s` is less than or equal to the new `l`, `e` is greater than or equal to the new `r`, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(new l, 0, 0)`. If `s` > `l`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s` <= `l` and `e` >= `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s` <= `l` and `e` < `N`, the state of the variables also remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
