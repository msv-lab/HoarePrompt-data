You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the elements from index 0 to index `n-2` are calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element of `ans` is set to \(10^9\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
   - We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
     - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
     - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \( 10^9 \).
   - It then iterates backward from \( n-2 \) to \( 0 \) and sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

3. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - The condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) must be satisfied.
   - For \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) to hold, \( a_i \) must be such that when divided by \( a_{i-1} \), the remainder is \( x_i \).
   - The solution sets \( a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i \). This ensures that \( a_{i+1} \) is greater than \( a_i \) and \( a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = x_i \).

4. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The first element \( a_1 \) is set to \( 10^9 \), which is a valid value within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).
   - The loop starts from \( n-2 \) and goes to \( 0 \), ensuring that all elements \( a_i \) for \( 2 \le i \le n \) are correctly calculated.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly. For \( n = 2 \), the array `arr` will have only one element \( x_2 \), and the solution will set \( a_2 = 10^9 - x_2 \), which satisfies \( x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1 \).

6. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the array `ans` for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
