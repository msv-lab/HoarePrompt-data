The value of `res` is updated to the input provided by the user. The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `item` remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', `arr` is `[2]` and `item` is `2`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', `arr` is `[0]` or `[1]` or `[0, 1]` and `item` is `0` or `1`. If `res` is '=', `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]` or `[0, 2]` or `[1, 2]` and `item` is `0` or `1`. `res` is the user input.**
