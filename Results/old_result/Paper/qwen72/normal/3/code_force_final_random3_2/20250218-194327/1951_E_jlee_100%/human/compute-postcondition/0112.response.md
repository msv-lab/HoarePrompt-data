Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `count2` is equal to `count`, and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
