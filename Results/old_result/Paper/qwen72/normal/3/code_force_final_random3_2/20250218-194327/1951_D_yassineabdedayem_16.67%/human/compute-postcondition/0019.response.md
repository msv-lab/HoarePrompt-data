Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` after being updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `number`, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The variables `Min` and `Max` are updated to the new values `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively.
- The initial state already specifies that `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`, so the values of `Min` and `Max` are consistent with the initial state.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
