Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 1, and `eta` is a list. If `q[j]` (i.e., `q[1]`) is greater than 0, `eta` contains the element 1. If `q[0]` is greater than 0, `eta` contains the element 0. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.***
