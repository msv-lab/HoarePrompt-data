Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array for each test case. However, this approach does not account for the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array is to sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the largest possible differences are achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation sorts the array and then computes the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which correctly maximizes the beauty of the array.
