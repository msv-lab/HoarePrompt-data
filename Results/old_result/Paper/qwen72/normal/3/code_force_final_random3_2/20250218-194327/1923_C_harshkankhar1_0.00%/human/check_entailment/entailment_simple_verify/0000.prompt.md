You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. However, based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `c`, `q`, and a list of queries. `c` is a list of positive integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), and the list of queries is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    n, q = map(int, input().split())

        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [a1, a1 + a2, a1 + a2 + a3, ..., a1 + a2 + ... + an] (where each element is the cumulative sum of the original `a` list up to that index)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list, `q` is 0, and for each pair of input integers `x` and `y` provided, the program has printed 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise it has printed 'YES'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has a length of 1. According to the problem description, a subarray is considered good if there exists an array `b` such that the sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray of `c`, and each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray of `c` and greater than 0. However, for a subarray of length 1, it is impossible to find such an array `b` because the only element in the subarray cannot be different from itself. The program incorrectly prints "NO" for all subarrays of length 1, which is not always correct. For example, if the subarray is `[2]`, it is not possible to find a `b` such that `b[1] > 0`, `b[1] != 2`, and `b[1] = 2`, so the output should be "NO". However, if the subarray is `[1]`, the program should also print "NO" because `b[1]` cannot be different from 1 and still equal 1. The program fails to handle this edge case correctly.
