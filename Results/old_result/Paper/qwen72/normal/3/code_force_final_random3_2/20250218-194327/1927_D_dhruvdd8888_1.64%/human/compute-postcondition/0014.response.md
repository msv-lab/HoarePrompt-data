The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `N` must still be greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`**
