Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`.** 

The initial state of `_` remains unchanged. The input is split into two integers, `n` and `m`, which are now assigned specific values based on the input. Both `n` and `m` must be positive integers within the range of 1 to 10,000.
