Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**: Inside `func_1`, it reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself. It then appends a `-1` to `nums` to handle the edge case where the entire array is a single segment of the same value.
   - **Building `arr`**: The program builds an array `arr` where each element is a tuple `(start, end, value)` representing the range of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal. This is done by iterating through `nums` and recording the start and end indices of each segment of consecutive equal values.
   - **Query Processing**: For each query `(l, r)`, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. This helps in quickly finding the segment that includes the index `l`.
   - **Conditions**:
     - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1 or greater than `r`. If so, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no valid pair exists. Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no valid pair exists.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the entire array is a single segment of the same value by appending `-1` to `nums`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where no valid pair exists within the query range.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the required output for each query, either a valid pair of indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Condition for `s > l`**: The condition `if s > l` is not sufficient to determine if a valid pair exists. It should also check if `s` is within the range `[l, r]`.
- **Incorrect Condition for `e >= r`**: The condition `elif e >= r` is not correctly handling the case where the segment ends exactly at `r`. It should be `elif e > r` to ensure the segment does not extend beyond `r`.
- **Incorrect Condition for `e < N or e < l`**: The condition `elif e < N or e < l` is not logically correct. It should be `elif e < r` to ensure the segment ends before `r`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
