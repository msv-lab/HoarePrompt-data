Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `i` is now 4, `num` is now `ar[3]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is set to 1.**

The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` since it was already set to 1 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
