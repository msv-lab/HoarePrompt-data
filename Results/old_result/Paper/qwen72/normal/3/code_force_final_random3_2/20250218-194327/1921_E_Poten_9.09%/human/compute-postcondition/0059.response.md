Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Alice', `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases, `clues` is a list of integers input by the user. The third element of `clues` is not greater than the fifth element, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element, and the fourth element of `clues` is less than the fifth element. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1. If either `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Alice'.***
