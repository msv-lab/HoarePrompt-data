Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- The first element in the `print` statement is the string `'?'`.
- The second and third elements are the value of `mak`, which is 0.
- The fourth and fifth elements are the value of `i`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
