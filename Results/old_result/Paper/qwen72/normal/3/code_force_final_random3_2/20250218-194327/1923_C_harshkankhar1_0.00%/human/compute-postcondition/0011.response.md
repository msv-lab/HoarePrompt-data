Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 3), `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x` (where `x` was 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` was 2), `b[2]` is `b[1] + x` (where `x` was 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` was 2), `b[3]` is `b[2] + x` (where `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2).**

Explanation:
- The code `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the value of `b[3]` to `b[2] + x`.
- `x` is determined based on the value of `a[3]`: if `a[3]` is greater than 1, `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2.
- `b[2]` is already defined as `b[1] + x` (where `x` was 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` was 2).
- `b[1]` is already defined as `b[0] + x` (where `x` was 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` was 2).
- The values of `n`, `i`, and the conditions for `x` based on `a[3]` remain unchanged.
