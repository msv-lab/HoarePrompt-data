To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 250\).
2. `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
3. `k` and `q` are assigned integer values from the input.
4. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element.
6. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
7. `n` is the first element of `qs`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n` and `res`:**
   - `n` is the first element of the list `qs`.
   - `res` is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element of `qs` and `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.

2. **Function `func_1(n, p)`:**
   - The function `func_1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we can only infer that it takes two arguments: an integer `n` and a list of integers `p`.
   - The result of `func_1(n, p)` is stored in the list `res`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement converts each element of the list `res` to a string using `map(str, res)`.
   - It then joins these string elements with a space character using `' '.join`.
   - Finally, it prints the resulting string.

### Output Determination:
- Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`.
- However, we know that `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element of `qs` and `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- The `print` statement will output the elements of `res` as a space-separated string.

### Final Output:
Output: **[space-separated string of elements in res] (where res is the result of func_1(n, p) and n is the first element of qs)**

This output description is as precise as possible given the information provided in the initial state.
