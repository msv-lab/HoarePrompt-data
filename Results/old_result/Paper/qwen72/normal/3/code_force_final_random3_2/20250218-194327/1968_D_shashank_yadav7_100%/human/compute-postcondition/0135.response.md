Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is 2, `k` is -3, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since `k` was initially -2 or -1, it is now -3.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `p`, `sp`, `bp`, `i`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
