Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

The code snippet `median_index = n // 2` reassigns the value of `median_index` to be the integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, and `median_index` was already assigned this value in the initial state, the value of `median_index` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state.
