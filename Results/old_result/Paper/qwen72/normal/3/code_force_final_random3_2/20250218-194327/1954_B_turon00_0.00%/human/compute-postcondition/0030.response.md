Let's break down the initial state and the code to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful (the exact definition of "beautiful" is not provided, but it implies some specific structure or property of the list).
   - `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the list `a`).
   - `tmp` is equal to `a[0]` (the first element of the list `a`).
   - `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n`.
   - `tmp` is the first element of `a`, i.e., `a[0]`.
   - `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`.

4. **Understanding `cnt` and `ans`:**
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`.
   - `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`.

5. **Possible Values:**
   - Since `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, it likely has some specific structure. However, without the exact definition of "beautiful," we can only infer that `a` has some property that ensures `cnt` and `ans` are well-defined.
   - `cnt` can be any integer from 0 to `n` (but since `a` is beautiful, it is likely to be a non-zero value).
   - `ans` will be the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of n and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to a[0] found in the list a)**
