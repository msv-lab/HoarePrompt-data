#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds played in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains a trump suit (one of "CDHS") and a list of 2n[i] unique card descriptions (each card description is a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the card, which is one of "23456789", and the second one is the suit of the card, which is one of "CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `card` will have processed each card description in the list generated by `input().split()`. `rank` and `suit` will be the rank and suit of the last card description processed. `trumps` will be a list containing the ranks of all cards that matched the `trump` suit. `answers` will be a list containing strings for each pair of cards of the same suit (but not the trump suit) that were encountered, where the strings are the concatenation of the sorted ranks with the suit appended to each, separated by a space. `suits` will be a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `suits` will still be a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit. `trumps` will be an empty list, as all its elements have been popped. `answers` will be a list containing strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. If `trumps` was not long enough to match all non-`None` ranks in `suits`, the loop will have printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned early.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `trumps` will be an empty list, and the `answers` list will contain the strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. The `suits` dictionary will remain unchanged from its initial state, as the loop does not modify it.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `trumps` is a list with at least one element for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, `answers` is a list containing all strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each such suit, and `suits` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of card descriptions to form pairs of cards, where each pair consists of one card from a non-trump suit and one card from the trump suit. It reads the trump suit and a list of card descriptions from user input. The function then pairs cards of the same non-trump suit and sorts the trump cards in descending order. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-`None` ranks in the `suits` dictionary, the function prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. Otherwise, it prints the pairs of cards, with each pair on a new line, and the trump cards paired with the remaining non-`None` ranks in the `suits` dictionary. The function does not return any specific value, and the state of `suits`, `suit`, `rank`, `trumps`, and `answers` is not preserved or returned.
