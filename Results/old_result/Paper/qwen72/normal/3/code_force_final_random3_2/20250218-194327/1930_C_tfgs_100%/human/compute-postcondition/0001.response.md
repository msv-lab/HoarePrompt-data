Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The initial state specifies that `n` is the number of integers in the list `a`, and each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9. The value of `t` and the constraint on the sum of `n` over all test cases remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `a` and retains the other conditions from the initial state.
