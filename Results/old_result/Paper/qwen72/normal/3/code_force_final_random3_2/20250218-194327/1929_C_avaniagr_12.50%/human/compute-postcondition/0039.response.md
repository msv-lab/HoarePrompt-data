Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the condition `a >= x + 3` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < x + 3` holds.***
