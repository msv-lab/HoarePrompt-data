Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive. `ops` is a list containing tuples based on the value of `v2` for each iteration. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` for each such iteration. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` for each such iteration. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**
