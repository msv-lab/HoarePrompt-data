Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` must have at least one element, each element in `array` is greater than 0, `j` is the first element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` (which is 'a' since `s[j]` is 0).**
