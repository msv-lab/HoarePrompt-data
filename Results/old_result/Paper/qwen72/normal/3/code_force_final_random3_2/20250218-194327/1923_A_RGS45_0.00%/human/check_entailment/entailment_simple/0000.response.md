### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the ribbon state `arr` as a string.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - The program finds the index of the first chip (`x`) using `arr.find('1')`.
   - The program finds the index of the last chip (`y`) by reversing the string and using `arr[::-1].find('1')`.

3. **Extracting the Substring:**
   - The program extracts the substring `z` from the first chip to the last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the substring `z` and prints this count.

### Analysis:

- **First Chip Index (`x`):**
  - `arr.find('1')` correctly finds the index of the first chip. If no chip is found, it returns `-1`, but the problem guarantees at least one chip, so this is not an issue.

- **Last Chip Index (`y`):**
  - `arr[::-1].find('1')` correctly finds the index of the last chip in the reversed string. This index is then used to calculate the position of the last chip in the original string. However, this calculation is not straightforward and can be simplified.

- **Substring Extraction (`z`):**
  - The substring `z` is extracted from the first chip to the last chip. The slicing `arr[x:n - y]` is intended to get the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips. However, this slicing might not always be correct because `n - y` is not the correct way to find the end index of the last chip in the original string.

- **Counting Free Cells:**
  - The program counts the number of `0`s in the substring `z`, which represents the number of free cells between the first and last chip. This is the correct approach to find the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

### Correctness:

- The program's logic for finding the first and last chip is correct.
- The substring extraction logic is flawed because `n - y` does not always give the correct end index for the last chip. Instead, the correct end index should be `n - y - 1` or `n - 1 - y` to account for the 0-based indexing and the reversed string.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y - 1]  # Corrected slicing
        
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Conclusion:

- The original program has a minor issue with the slicing logic, but the overall approach is correct.
- The corrected program should work as expected for all valid inputs.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False** (due to the slicing issue)
