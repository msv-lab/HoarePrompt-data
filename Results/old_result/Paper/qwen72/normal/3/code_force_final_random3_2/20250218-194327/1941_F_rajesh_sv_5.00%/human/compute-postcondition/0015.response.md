The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2
- `n` must still be greater than `i`, so `n` must be greater than 2

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, A is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), D is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9), F is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9), `max_diff` is -infinity, `next_max_diff` is -infinity, `index` is None, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]` and `index` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]`.**
