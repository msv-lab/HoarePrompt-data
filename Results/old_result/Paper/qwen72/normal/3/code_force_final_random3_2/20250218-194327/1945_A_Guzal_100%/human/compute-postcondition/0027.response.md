Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `1 + 0 + a + (b + c) // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input.
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than 2.
- `k` was initially `0 + a + (b + c) // 3`.
- The code `k += 1` increments `k` by 1, so the new value of `k` is `1 + 0 + a + (b + c) // 3`.
