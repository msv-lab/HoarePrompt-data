Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the requirement that no permutation of scenarios should have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. Specifically, the logic for assigning 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transitions is flawed.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Input Example:**
   ```
   5
   .?F??
   ?.???
   F?.S?
   ??S.?
   ????.
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   .FFFF
   F.FFF
   FF.SF
   FFS.F
   FFFF.
   ```

   **Actual Output:**
   The program might produce an output like:
   ```
   .FFFF
   F.FFF
   FF.SF
   FFS.F
   FFFF.
   ```

   This output is correct, but let's consider a different input where the program fails.

2. **Input Example:**
   ```
   6
   .?????
   ??.????
   ??.????
   ??.????
   ??.????
   ??.????
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   A valid output could be:
   ```
   .FSFSF
   F.FSFS
   SFS.FS
   FSFS.F
   SFSFS.
   FSFSF.
   ```

   **Actual Output:**
   The program might produce an output like:
   ```
   .FFFFF
   F.FFFF
   FFFFF.
   FFFFF.
   FFFFF.
   FFFFF.
   ```

   In this output, the sequence of transition videos for any permutation of the scenarios will have 5 consecutive 'F' videos, which exceeds \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 6}{4} \rceil = 5\).

### Explanation of the Flaw:
The program's logic for assigning 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transitions is based on the number of already decided 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario. However, this approach does not guarantee that the final transition plan will meet the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.

The program should have a more sophisticated approach to ensure that the transition plan is balanced and meets the requirement for all permutations. For example, it could use a backtracking algorithm to try different assignments and check if the requirement is satisfied for all permutations.
