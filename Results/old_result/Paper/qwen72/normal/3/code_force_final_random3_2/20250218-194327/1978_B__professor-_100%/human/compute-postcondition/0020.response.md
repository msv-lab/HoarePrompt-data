Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input, `t` is greater than 2, and `_` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer, assigning these integers to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b` as provided by the input, and the unchanged values of `t` and `_`.
