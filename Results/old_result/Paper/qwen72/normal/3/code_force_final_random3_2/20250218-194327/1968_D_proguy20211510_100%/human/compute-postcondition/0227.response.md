Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1, and `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end. `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The code `paths.append(a[ps - 1])` adds the element `a[ps - 1]` to the end of the list `paths`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as described in the initial state. If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1, the loop or if statement is broken, but this does not affect the variables mentioned.
