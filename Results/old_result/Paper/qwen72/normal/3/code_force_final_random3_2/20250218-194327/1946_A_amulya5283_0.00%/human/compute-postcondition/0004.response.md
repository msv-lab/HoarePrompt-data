Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`.**

The code calculates the `median_index` by performing integer division of `n` by 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The `median_index` is now set to the integer part of `n` divided by 2.
