Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except for the elements at indices that were in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appeared in `array`.
- `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0.
- `j` is the last element in `array`.
- `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appeared in `array`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and List Initialization:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 1. This is likely the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the `print(ans)` statement.
   - `l` is an input integer greater than 0. This is the length of the list `s`.
   - `s` is a list of `l` integers, initially all set to 0.

2. **Array and List Modification:**
   - `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0.
   - For each index `j` in `array`, the element at index `j` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`.

3. **String Construction:**
   - `ans` is constructed by iterating over each element `j` in `array` and converting the value `s[j] + 97` to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The ASCII value 97 corresponds to the character 'a'. Therefore, `s[j] + 97` will map to characters starting from 'a' and increasing based on the value of `s[j]`.

### Example to Illustrate:
- Suppose `l = 5` and `array = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]`.
- Initially, `s = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- After processing `array`, `s` will be modified as follows:
  - `s[1]` is incremented 3 times: `s[1] = 3`.
  - `s[2]` is incremented 2 times: `s[2] = 2`.
  - `s[3]` is incremented 1 time: `s[3] = 1`.
  - `s[4]` remains 0.
  - `s[5]` remains 0.
- Therefore, `s = [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.

- Now, `ans` is constructed by converting `s[j] + 97` to characters for each `j` in `array`:
  - For `j = 1`: `s[1] + 97 = 3 + 97 = 100` -> 'd'.
  - For `j = 2`: `s[2] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99` -> 'c'.
  - For `j = 1`: `s[1] + 97 = 3 + 97 = 100` -> 'd'.
  - For `j = 3`: `s[3] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98` -> 'b'.
  - For `j = 2`: `s[2] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99` -> 'c'.
  - For `j = 1`: `s[1] + 97 = 3 + 97 = 100` -> 'd'.

- Therefore, `ans = 'dcbdcd'`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print a string where each character corresponds to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appeared in `array`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string of characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appeared in `array`)**
