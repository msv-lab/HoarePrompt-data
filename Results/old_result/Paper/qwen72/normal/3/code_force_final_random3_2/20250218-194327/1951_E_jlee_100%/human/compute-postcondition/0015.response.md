Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the loop control flow is affected.
