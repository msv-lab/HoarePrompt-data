To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. Since `test_cases` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the first index of the range.

The state of `answers` and the function `func` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the sake of completeness, we can mention that `answers` is an empty list and `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the actual implementation should handle multiple test cases.

State: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is an empty list, `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases**
