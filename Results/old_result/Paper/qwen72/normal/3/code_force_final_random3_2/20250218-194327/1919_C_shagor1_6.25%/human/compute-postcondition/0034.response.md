Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `x` and `y` are the smallest and second smallest unique integers from the list `inp`. If no such integers exist, both `x` and `y` are set to `n + 1`.
   - `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `inp` is a list of integers.
   - `x` and `y` are determined based on the unique integers in `inp`. If `inp` contains at least two unique integers, `x` will be the smallest and `y` will be the second smallest. If `inp` contains fewer than two unique integers, both `x` and `y` will be set to `n + 1`.
   - `ans` is calculated by counting how many integers in `inp` are greater than both `x` and `y`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.

4. **Determining the Value of `ans`**:
   - If `inp` contains at least two unique integers, `x` and `y` will be the smallest and second smallest unique integers, respectively.
   - The value of `ans` will be the count of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.
   - If `inp` contains fewer than two unique integers, both `x` and `y` will be set to `n + 1`, and `ans` will be 0 because no integer in `inp` can be greater than `n + 1`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be the value of `ans`, which is the count of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`, and `x` and `y` are the smallest and second smallest unique integers from `inp` or both are `n + 1` if no such integers exist)**
