Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is `True`.** 

The variable `is_already_stairs` is now set to `True`, while all other variables (`i`, `arr`, `start_index`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
