Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer in the fourth line of the file, `x` is the second integer in the fourth line of the file and `x` must be at least `k - 3`, `a` is the third integer in the fourth line of the file, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 4 lines, `s` is the fourth line of the file, `z` is the result of the loop after `x - k + 3` iterations, where each iteration updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is `x - k + 2`. Additionally, `a` is less than `z`.**
