The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the new `s` is '<', `mak` is 1 and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If the new `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. If the new `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.**
