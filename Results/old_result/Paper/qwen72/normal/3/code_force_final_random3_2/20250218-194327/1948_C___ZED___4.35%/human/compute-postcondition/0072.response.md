Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 4.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is 3.
   - If the character at index 1 of `a` is not `>`, `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of the variable `k`.
   - According to the initial state, `k` is explicitly defined as 3.

Therefore, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be the value of `k`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
