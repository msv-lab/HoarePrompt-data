Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `card` will have processed each card description in the list generated by `input().split()`. `rank` and `suit` will be the rank and suit of the last card description processed. `trumps` will be a list containing the ranks of all cards that matched the `trump` suit. `answers` will be a list containing strings for each pair of cards of the same suit (but not the trump suit) that were encountered, where the strings are the concatenation of the sorted ranks with the suit appended to each, separated by a space. `suits` will be a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit, and `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. `rank` is `None`, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, and `answers` is a list that has been appended with a string in the format `'None{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`, where `{suit}` is a key from the `suits` dictionary and `{popped_trump}` is the last element of the `trumps` list before the pop operation.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit, and `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. If `trumps` is not empty, `rank` is the rank of the next suit in the dictionary that is not `None`, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, and `answers` is a list that has been appended with a string in the format `'None{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` if `rank` is `None`, otherwise it has been appended with a string in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit, and `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. `suit` is the next suit in the dictionary, `rank` is the value associated with that suit in the dictionary. If `trumps` is not an empty list, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, and `answers` is a list that has been appended with a string in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` if `rank` is not `None`, or `'None{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` if `rank` is `None`. If `trumps` is an empty list, the program returns without providing any specific value, leaving the state of `suits`, `suit`, `rank`, `trumps`, and `answers` unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
