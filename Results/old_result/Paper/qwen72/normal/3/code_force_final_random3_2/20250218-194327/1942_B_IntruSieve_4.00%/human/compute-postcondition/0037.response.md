To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `itm` and `mex`. The loop will execute if `mex` is not an empty list. Let's break down the requirements step by step:

1. **`mex` must be a non-empty list**: The loop will only execute if `mex` contains at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `mex`.

2. **`itm` is the current element in `mex` during the first iteration**: Before the loop starts, `itm` is not defined, but it will be set to the first element of `mex` during the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for all `arr[i] <= 0` in the list `arr`.
- `func_1` is not properly defined (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mex` is a list containing the values `0` for each `arr[i] > 0` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each `arr[i] <= 0`.
- `minn` is the number of positive elements in `arr` plus 1 if the last positive element was equal to the current `minn` value.
- `i` is `n-1`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `mex` is non-empty and `itm` is set to the first element of `mex`.

State: **`mex` is a list containing at least one element, `itm` is the first element of `mex`**
