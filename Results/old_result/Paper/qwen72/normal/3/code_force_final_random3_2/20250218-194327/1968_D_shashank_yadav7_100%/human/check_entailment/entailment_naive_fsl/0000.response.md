Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores and positions of the players. According to the problem, the score should be updated at the beginning of each turn, and then the player can either stay or move to the position specified by the permutation. However, the program updates the scores and positions in a way that does not match this logic.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
The expected output should be:
```
Bodya
```
However, the program will produce an incorrect output. The issue lies in the way the program updates the scores and positions. The program incorrectly decrements `k` and updates the scores and positions in a loop that does not accurately simulate the game's rules. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where a player can choose to stay at their current position, and it incorrectly calculates the maximum possible scores for each player.

To correctly simulate the game, the program should:
1. Initialize the scores of both players.
2. For each turn, update the scores based on the current positions.
3. Allow each player to either stay or move to the position specified by the permutation.
4. Compare the final scores after `k` turns to determine the winner.

The current implementation does not follow these steps accurately, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
