Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` and must have at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- `done` remains `False` unless the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`.
- Additionally, the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides several conditions and variable values, but none of these conditions or values affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
