Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list where each key (node) has a list of its connected nodes (edges), and each node `u` and `v` that were input during the loop execution are appended to each other's lists. `empty` remains `True` since it is not modified within the loop. `ends` is an empty list.**
