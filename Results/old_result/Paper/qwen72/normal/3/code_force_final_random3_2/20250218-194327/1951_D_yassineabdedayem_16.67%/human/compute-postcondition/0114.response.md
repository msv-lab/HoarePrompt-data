Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

The value of `number` is now equal to `Max`, which is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
