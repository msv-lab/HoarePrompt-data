Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1, and if `q[j]` > 0, `eta` is a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list or a list containing the value 0, depending on whether `q[j]` was greater than 0.***
