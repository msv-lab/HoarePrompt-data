Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not consider the actual vertices Bessie has chosen to form the diagonals. Instead, it simply prints `x - 2` for each test case, which is the number of triangles that can be formed by connecting all `x` chosen vertices in a convex polygon. However, the problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake, and this can be influenced by the specific positions of the chosen vertices.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

1. **Identify the segments**: Determine the segments (or arcs) between the chosen vertices.
2. **Count the triangles**: For each segment, count the number of triangles that can be formed by adding diagonals within that segment.

Here is a more detailed approach to solve the problem correctly:

1. **Read the input**: Parse the number of test cases, the number of sides `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the chosen vertices.
2. **Sort the chosen vertices**: Sort the vertices to easily identify the segments.
3. **Calculate the segments**: Calculate the lengths of the segments between the chosen vertices. Remember to consider the wrap-around segment from the last chosen vertex to the first.
4. **Count the triangles**: For each segment of length `L`, the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `L - 2` (if `L > 2`).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
            arr.sort()
            
            # Add the wrap-around segment
            segments = [(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) % n for i in range(x)]
            segments.append((n - arr[-1] + arr[0]) % n)
            
            # Count the number of triangles
            triangles = 0
            for segment in segments:
                if segment > 2:
                    triangles += segment - 2
            
            print(triangles)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program correctly identifies the segments and counts the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed within those segments.
