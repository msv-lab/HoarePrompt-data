Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, and `nx` is updated as follows: If the character at position `i-1` in the string `xx[i]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` if it is not '?', or 'F' if the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` is '?' and either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'S' otherwise, concatenated with the character at position `i-1` in the string `xx[i]`. If the character at position `i-1` in the string `xx[i]` is '?', `nx` is the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` if it is not '?', or 'FF' if the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` is '?' and either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'FS' if the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'SF' if the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` is '?' and either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'SS' otherwise.**
