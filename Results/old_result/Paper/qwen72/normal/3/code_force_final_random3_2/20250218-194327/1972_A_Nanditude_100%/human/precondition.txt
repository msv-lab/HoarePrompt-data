t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a and b are lists of integers of length n, a is sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, and b is sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9.
