The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute again as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, but it must still be greater than 0.

State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]`**

After adjusting:
State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]`**

However, to clarify the adjustment more precisely:
State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]`**
