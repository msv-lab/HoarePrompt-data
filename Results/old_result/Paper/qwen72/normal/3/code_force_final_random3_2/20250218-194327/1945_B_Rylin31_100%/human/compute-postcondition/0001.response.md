The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer provided by user input, but it does not specify the value of `t`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
