The code snippet `mex.append(minn)` appends the current value of `minn` to the list `mex`. Based on the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `[0, 0]`, `minn` is 2, and `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`.
- If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1) if it is greater than the current `maxx`, and `mex` contains the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus `minn` and `0`.

In both cases, `minn` is either 0, 1, or 2. The value of `minn` will be appended to `mex`.

Output State: **`maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn`, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0, minn]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` and `0` and `minn`, `minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2.**
