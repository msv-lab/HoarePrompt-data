Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0.**

The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, and `len_b` remain unchanged. The variables `count_a` and `count_b` are both initialized to 0.
