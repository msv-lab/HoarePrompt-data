Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being '>'.
   - `k` will be set to 1 by the loop.
   - `no_path` is True.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `k` is explicitly stated to be set to 1 by the loop.
   - Since `k` is set to 1, the `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the integer value 1.

Output: **1**
