Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, and `mid` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the list `cliquess` at the index `left + i`.
- The value of `clique` remains a positive integer.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The value of `arr[left + i]` is still `left + 1 + i` because `i` has been incremented.
- The values of `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `mid` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid.
