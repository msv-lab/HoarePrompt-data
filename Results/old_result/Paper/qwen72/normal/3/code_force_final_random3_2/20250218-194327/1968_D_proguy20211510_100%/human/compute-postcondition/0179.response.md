Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `curr`, `paths`, `ps`, `preb`, `resb`, and `ress` are as described in the precondition. If `k < i + 1`, `curr` is updated to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is updated to the maximum of `ress` and `curr` from the previous iteration, `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1, ensuring `paths` still has at least `i + 1` elements.***
