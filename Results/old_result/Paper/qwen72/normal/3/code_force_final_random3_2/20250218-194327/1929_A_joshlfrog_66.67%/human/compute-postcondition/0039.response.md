Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is 100000000 if `nums[0]` >= 100000000, otherwise `y` is `nums[0]`, `x` is `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` > 0 and `nums[1]` > `x`, otherwise `x` remains 0 if `nums[1]` <= 0 or `nums[1]` <= `x`.***
