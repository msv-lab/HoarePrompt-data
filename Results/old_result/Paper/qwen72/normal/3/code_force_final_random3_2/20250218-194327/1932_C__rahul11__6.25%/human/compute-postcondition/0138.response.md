Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, and `r` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The value of `res[c]` remains updated to `ans % m % MOD` as it was in the initial state.
- The condition for updating `ans` and `r` is met, as the initial state indicates that `s[k]` is not 'L'.
