Output State: **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, and `sm` remain unchanged; `s` is now `p[s] - 1`; `bm` is now `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp);` `sm` is now `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)` if `k` is not 0, otherwise all variables remain unchanged and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`.
- Since `s` is already updated to `p[s] - 1` in the initial state, the expression `a[s] * k + sp` becomes `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp`.
- If `k` is 0, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `p`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `k` is not 0, the value of `sm` is updated as described, and the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.
