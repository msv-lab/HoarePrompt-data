### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of cliques such that every pair of vertices (i, j) with \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is connected.
   - We need to print the assignment of integers to vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n, k)`**:
     - Calculates the number of cliques as \( \text{ceil}(n / k) \).
     - Initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
     - Calls `make_array` to fill `arr` and `cliquess` for each clique.
     - Prints the elements of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the elements of `cliquess`.

   - **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - Fills the `arr` list from index `left` to `right` with a sequence of integers.
     - The first half of the sequence is in ascending order starting from `left + 1`.
     - The second half of the sequence is in descending order starting from `right + 1`.
     - Sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to the value of `clique`.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Distinct Integers**: The function `make_array` ensures that the integers assigned to vertices are distinct and within the range 1 to n.
   - **Clique Calculation**: The number of cliques is calculated as \( \text{ceil}(n / k) \), which is a reasonable approach to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - **Clique Assignment**: The function `make_array` assigns vertices to cliques in a way that ensures the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), the function should correctly assign the vertices to a single clique.
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \), the function should correctly partition the vertices into 2 cliques.
   - For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \), the function should correctly assign all vertices to a single clique.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The output format matches the problem description: it prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions `func_1` and `make_array` together correctly solve the problem as described. They ensure that the vertices are assigned distinct integers, the number of cliques is minimized, and the graph is partitioned correctly.

Correctness: **True**
