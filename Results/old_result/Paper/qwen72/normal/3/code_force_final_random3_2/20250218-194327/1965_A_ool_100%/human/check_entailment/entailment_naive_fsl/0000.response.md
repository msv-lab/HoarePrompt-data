Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones correctly. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by choosing \( k \) equal to the number of stones in each pile, which will empty all piles at once. However, the function `func_1` does not account for this scenario. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```

The program should output "Alice" because Alice can choose \( k = 3 \) and win immediately. However, the current implementation of `func_1` will incorrectly return "Bob" because it checks if the smallest element is 1, and since it is not, it returns "Alice" without considering the possibility of all elements being the same. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected.
