Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and provide output through standard output (stdout). The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The value of `t` is now the integer input provided by the user. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    e = set(l)
    m = len(l)
    if 1 in l:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`. If `1` is in the list `l`, the list `l` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `l`, and `m` is the length of the list `l`. If `1` is in the list `l`, the set `e` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in the set `e`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `l`, and `m` is the length of the list `l`. If `1` is in the list `l`, the set `e` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in the set `e`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
