To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `tmp`.

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, and if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is further incremented by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.
   - If `y < i - 1`, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged.
   - `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`.
   - `i` is the second element of `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least two elements.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in tmp:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop head iterates over the elements of `tmp`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second element of `tmp`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `tmp`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` should be the third element of `tmp` (assuming `tmp` has at least three elements).
   - `tmp` must have at least three elements for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, and if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is further incremented by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y < i - 1`, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the third element of `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least three elements.**
