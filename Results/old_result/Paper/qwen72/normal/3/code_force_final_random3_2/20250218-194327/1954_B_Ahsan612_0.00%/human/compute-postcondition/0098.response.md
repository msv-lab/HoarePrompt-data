The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len(ar)`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar` (`num`), then `same` is 2 and `minn` remains `inf`, and `i` is now 3. Otherwise, `i` is now 3, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `same` remains 1, and `minn` is set to 1.**
