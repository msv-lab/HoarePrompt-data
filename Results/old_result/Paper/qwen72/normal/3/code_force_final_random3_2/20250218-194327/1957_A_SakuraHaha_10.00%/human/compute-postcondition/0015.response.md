The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `cnt`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `cnt`. If there are more values in `cnt.values()`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the next value in `cnt.values()`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must now be the subsequent value in `cnt.values()`, and `cnt` must still have at least one more value to iterate over.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is increased by `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`, `x` is the next value in `cnt.values()`**
