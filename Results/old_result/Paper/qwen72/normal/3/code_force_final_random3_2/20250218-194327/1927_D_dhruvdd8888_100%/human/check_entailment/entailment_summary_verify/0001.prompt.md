You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads a list of integers and processes a series of queries. Each query is a tuple `(l, r)` representing a range within the list. The function outputs a pair of integers for each query, indicating the boundaries of a segment where the segment can be split into two parts such that the first part is strictly less than the second part. If no such segment exists within the query range, it outputs `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it directly prints the results of the queries. The state of the input list and the queries remains unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It appends `-1` to the array `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It iterates through the array to group consecutive equal elements into a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the number of the group.
   - For each query, it reads the query boundaries `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index of the group is just greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It retrieves the start and end indices of the group at `eli` or the last group if `eli` is out of bounds.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists within the query range:
     - If the start index of the group is greater than `l` and the start index is not 1 and not greater than `r`, it prints the indices `s-1` and `s`.
     - If the end index of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
     - If the end index of the group is less than `N` or less than `l`, it prints the indices `s` and `e+1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly groups consecutive equal elements in the array.
   - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate to find the start of the group that might contain the query range.
   - The conditions to check if a valid pair exists within the query range are logically sound:
     - If the start index of the group is greater than `l` and not 1 or greater than `r`, it means there is a valid pair just before the start of the group.
     - If the end index of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it means the group extends beyond the query range, and no valid pair exists.
     - If the end index of the group is less than `N` or less than `l`, it means there is a valid pair just after the end of the group.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it means the group is entirely within the query range and all elements are the same, so no valid pair exists.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the query range is entirely within a single group of equal elements.
   - The program also handles the case where the query range spans multiple groups.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to efficiently find the start of the group, which is `O(log N)` per query.
   - The overall complexity is `O(N + Q log N)`, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct and handles the problem as described. It correctly groups consecutive equal elements and efficiently checks for valid pairs within the query range.

Correctness: **True**
