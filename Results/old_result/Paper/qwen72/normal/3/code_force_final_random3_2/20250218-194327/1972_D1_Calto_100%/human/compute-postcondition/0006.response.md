Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) - 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`.
- Since `i` is 2, `i * i - i` equals `2 * 2 - 2`, which is 2.
- Therefore, `x` becomes `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, `i`, `y`) remain unchanged.
