Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `1 + (t * (n + 1))`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing all the elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, where `n` and `a` are updated according to the input data for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `input` variable still refers to the `sys.stdin.read` function, and the `data` list remains unchanged as it contains the strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`. The `idx` variable is calculated based on the final value of `t` and `n`, but since `t` is always 0, `idx` will be `1`. The `t` variable remains 0 throughout the loop. The `results` list contains all the results from the function `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, with each result corresponding to the respective values of `n` and `a` updated according to the input data for each iteration.
