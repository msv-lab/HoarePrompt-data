The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (`k`, `ratings`, `a`, and `wins`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
