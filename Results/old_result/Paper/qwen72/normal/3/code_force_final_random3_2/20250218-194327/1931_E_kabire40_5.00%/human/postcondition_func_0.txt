The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It reverses each integer in the list, concatenates those that have the same length as their original form, and sorts the reversed integers that have a different length. It then concatenates these sorted integers, alternating between their reversed and original forms. Finally, it compares the resulting concatenated integer to 10 raised to the power of `m` and prints 'Sasha' if the result is greater, otherwise it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value.
