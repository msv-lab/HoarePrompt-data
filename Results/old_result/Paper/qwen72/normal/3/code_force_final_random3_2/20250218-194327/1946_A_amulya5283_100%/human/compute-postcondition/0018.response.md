The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `mdx` to `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases.
- `t` is an input integer minus 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user.
- `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `i` is `mdx + 1`.
- If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is set to 2. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is `mdx + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mdx + 2`.

State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is 2 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[mdx + 1]`, otherwise `res` remains 0.**
