Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n`, `ans` is -1**

The code snippet `right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` updates the value of `right` to be the difference between the second element of the last sublist in `S` and the second element of the sublist at index `i` (which is 1). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
