### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string` and converts it to a list of characters `s`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the function correctly prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome.
   - If the first and last characters of the string `x` and `s[-1]` are different, the function correctly prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition, as the string is already non-palindromic.

3. **Uniform Character Check**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the function correctly prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.
   - If all but one character are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the function checks if the middle character is different. If the string length is odd and the middle character is different, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

4. **General Case**:
   - The function iterates through the string to find the first pair of characters that are not the same (`s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`). If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.
   - If no such pair is found, it uses `count` and `count2` to track positions where characters differ from the first character `x`. It then attempts to partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings based on these counts.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions.
   - If "YES" is printed, it also prints the number of parts and the partitioned substrings.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the edge cases and general cases correctly. However, there is a potential issue in the logic for partitioning the string when `s.count(x) == n - 1` and the string length is odd. Specifically, the condition `s[(n - 1) // 2] != x` is not sufficient to determine if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, the string "ababa" should be partitioned into "ab" and "aba", but the current logic might incorrectly print "NO".

### Correctness: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings even when `s.count(x) == n - 1` and the string length is odd. We can do this by always checking if the string can be split into two parts where at least one part is non-palindromic.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        
        s = list(string)
        
        n = len(s)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        x = s[0]
        
        if x != s[-1]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        
        if s.count(x) == n:
            print('NO')
            continue
        elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(string[0], string[1:])
            continue
        
        for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
            if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
                print('YES')
                print(1)
                print(string)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version ensures that if all but one character are the same, the string is split into two parts where the first part is a single character and the second part is the rest of the string, which is non-palindromic.
