Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
2. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
3. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
4. `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
5. `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

### Conditions:
- If `s` > `l`, then:
  - `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or
  - `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`.
- If `s` â‰¤ `l`, then:
  - `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or
  - `e` is less than `r`.
- Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, then:
  - `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`.
- Otherwise, `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
- The initial state and conditions provided do not affect the values being printed by the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the variables `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, and `arr`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print `-1` and `-1` regardless of the initial state and conditions.

Output: **-1, -1**
