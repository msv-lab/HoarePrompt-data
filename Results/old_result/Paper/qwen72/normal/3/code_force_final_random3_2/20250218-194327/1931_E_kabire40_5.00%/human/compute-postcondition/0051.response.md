Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a string that contains all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` (which is currently empty) and the reversed form of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val` (which is currently empty). If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the integer value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`.**
