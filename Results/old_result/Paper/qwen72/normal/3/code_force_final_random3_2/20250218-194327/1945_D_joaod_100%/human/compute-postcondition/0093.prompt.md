Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is 0, and `best` is `sys.float_info.max`.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, and `best` is `sys.float_info.max`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is no longer greater than the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to the minimum of `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 2`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
