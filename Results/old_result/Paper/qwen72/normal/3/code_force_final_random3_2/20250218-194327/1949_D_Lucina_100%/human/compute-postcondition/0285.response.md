Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` includes the index `i`, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 3, `nx` is either the first character of `xx[3]` (if it is not equal to '?') or 'S' if the first character is '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'F'. If `xx[3][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is now the original `nx` value plus the character at index 1 of `xx[3]` followed by 'S'. If `xx[3][1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is either 'FSS' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or 'FS' if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.**
