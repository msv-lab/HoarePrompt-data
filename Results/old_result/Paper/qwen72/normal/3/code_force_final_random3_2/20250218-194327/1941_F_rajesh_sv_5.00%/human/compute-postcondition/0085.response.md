Postcondition: ***`l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, and `l` is equal to `h`. `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.***
