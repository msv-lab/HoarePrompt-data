Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `nodes[u]` now contains the list [v].** 

The code snippet `nodes[u].append(v)` adds the integer `v` to the list associated with the key `u` in the `nodes` defaultdict. The other variables remain unchanged.
