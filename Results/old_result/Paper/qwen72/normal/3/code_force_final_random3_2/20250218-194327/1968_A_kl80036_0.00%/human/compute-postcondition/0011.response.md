Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - `y` is defined as `x // 2`, which means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(y)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `y`:**
   - Since `y` is defined as `x // 2`, `y` will be the integer part of the division of `x` by 2.
   - For example, if `x` is 10, then `y` will be 5. If `x` is 9, then `y` will be 4.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is the integer division of `x` by 2.
   - Given the range of `x` (2 to 1000), `y` will be an integer in the range from 1 to 500.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2, and x is an integer in the range 2 to 1000)**
