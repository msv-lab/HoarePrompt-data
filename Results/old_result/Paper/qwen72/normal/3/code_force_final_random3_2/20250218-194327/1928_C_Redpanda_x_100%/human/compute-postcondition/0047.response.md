Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factorization of `n`, `nn` is 1, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime factor of `n` such that `i * i` > `n`, `primes` is a list of the keys from the `factors` dictionary, and `generate(0)` has returned an iterable containing the second prime factor of `n`. The generator has yielded the second prime factor of `n`.**
