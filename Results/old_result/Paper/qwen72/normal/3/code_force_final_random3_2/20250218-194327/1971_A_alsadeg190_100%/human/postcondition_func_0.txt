The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `x` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, and prints them in ascending order. The function performs this action for each of the `x` test cases. After the function concludes, the input values have been processed and printed, but no data is returned or stored.
