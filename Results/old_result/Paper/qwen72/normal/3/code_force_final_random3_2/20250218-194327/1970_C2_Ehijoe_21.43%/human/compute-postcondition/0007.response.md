Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `nodes[u]` now contains the list [v], `nodes[v]` now contains the list [u].** 

The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the list stored in `nodes[v]`. Therefore, `nodes[v]` now contains the list `[u]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
