Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` is `[1]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [i]` updates the value of `arr` to a list containing the value of `i`, which is 1.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- The value of `maxi` remains the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
- The value of `mini` remains the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
- The value of `item` remains the last element of `arr` that was processed.
- The value of `res` remains an input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'.
