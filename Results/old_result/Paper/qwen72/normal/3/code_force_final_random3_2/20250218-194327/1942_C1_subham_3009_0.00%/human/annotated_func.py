#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a regular polygon with `n` sides, where `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and a set of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie, where `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is fixed at 0. The vertices chosen by Bessie are represented as a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The function should return the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `x` is the second last input integer, `y` is the third last input integer, `arr` is a list of integers containing the last `x` elements converted from the original list of strings.
    #State: *If the script is executed as the main module, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `x` is the second last input integer, `y` is the third last input integer, and `arr` is a list of integers containing the last `x` elements converted from the original list of strings. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of the number of sides `n` of a regular polygon, the number of vertices `x` chosen by Bessie, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, the function prints the value `x - 2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. If the script is not executed as the main module, no changes are made to the variables.
