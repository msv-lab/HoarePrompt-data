The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it is expected to handle a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, a number `n` representing the number of special characters required in a string. Since the function signature does not include these parameters, it is likely that the function is designed to generate or return a string with a specified number of special characters, but the details of how it receives `t` and `n` are not provided in the function signature. Assuming the function is designed to return a string with `n` special characters for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function generates and returns a string containing a specified number of special characters for each test case. The number of test cases and the number of special characters required per test case are not explicitly passed as parameters but are expected to be handled within the function.**
