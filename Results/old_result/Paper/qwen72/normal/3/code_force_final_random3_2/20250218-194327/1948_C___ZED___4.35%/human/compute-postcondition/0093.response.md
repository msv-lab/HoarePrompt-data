The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `no_path`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
