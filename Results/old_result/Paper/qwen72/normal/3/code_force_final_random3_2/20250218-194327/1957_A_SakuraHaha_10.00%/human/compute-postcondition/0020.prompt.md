You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all values `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each key being an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of \(x // 4\) for all values \(x\) in `cnt.values()`, and `cnt` is a dictionary with each key being an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided output description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
