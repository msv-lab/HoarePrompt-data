### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Monocarp has `n` friends.
   - Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`.
   - A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the first line contains `n`, the number of friends.
   - The second line contains `n` integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n`, where `p_i` is the best friend of friend `i`.
   - The output should be the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`:
     - It reads the number of friends `n`.
     - It initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, where `v[0]` is unused and `v[1]` to `v[n]` are the best friends of friends `1` to `n`.
     - If `n == 2`, it prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come.
     - Otherwise, it iterates through each friend `i` from `1` to `n`.
     - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, which means that the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself. This indicates a cycle of length 3 or a direct mutual best friend relationship.
     - If such a cycle is found, it prints `2` and returns.
     - If no such cycle is found, it prints `3`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 2` by printing `2`.
   - For `n > 2`, the program checks for cycles of length 3 or direct mutual best friend relationships. If such a cycle is found, it prints `2` because inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure both come to the party.
   - If no such cycle is found, it prints `3` because inviting three friends will ensure at least two of them come to the party. This is because in the worst case, the friends are arranged in a way that no two friends are mutual best friends, and inviting three friends will cover at least one mutual best friend pair.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 2`.
   - For `n > 2`, the program should correctly identify cycles of length 3 or mutual best friend relationships, and it does so by checking `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.

6. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The program assumes that the input is valid and follows the constraints.
   - The program does not handle cases where there might be cycles of length greater than 3, but the problem only requires ensuring at least 2 friends come to the party, and the program's logic is sufficient for this purpose.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the given problem and all test cases. It ensures that the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to the party is calculated correctly.

Final: **True**
