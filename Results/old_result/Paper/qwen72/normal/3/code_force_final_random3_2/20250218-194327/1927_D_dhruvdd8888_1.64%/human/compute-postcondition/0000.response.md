Output State: **The initial state remains unchanged, but the `input` function now refers to `sys.stdin.readline`.** 

This means that `t` is still a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is still an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `a` is still a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `q` is still an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5), and for each query, `l` and `r` are still integers (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. However, the `input` function is now set to read input from `sys.stdin.readline`.
