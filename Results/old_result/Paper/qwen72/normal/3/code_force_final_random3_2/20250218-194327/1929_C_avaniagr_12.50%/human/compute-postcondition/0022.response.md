To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(x + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter.
   - The expression `x + 1` determines the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x + 1` is greater than 1.
   - `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Adjust the Loop Counter `i`:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.

4. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `x + 1`.
   - Since `x + 1` is greater than 1, and `i` is now 2, the loop will execute if `x + 1` is greater than 2.

5. **State of `z`:**
   - The state of `z` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, it is updated in the loop body, and this update will be reflected in the next iteration.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- `x + 1` must be greater than 2.
- `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`.

State: **`i` is 2, `x + 1` is greater than 2, `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**
