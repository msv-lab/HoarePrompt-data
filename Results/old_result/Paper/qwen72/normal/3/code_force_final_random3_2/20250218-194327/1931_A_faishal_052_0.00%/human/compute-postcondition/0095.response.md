Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`, `lex` is an input integer less than or equal to 25.**

The value of `lex` is decreased by 1, so the new value of `lex` is now an integer less than or equal to 25. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
