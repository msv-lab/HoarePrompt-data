The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the input integer `n`. The loop depends on the value of `t` and the input integer `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`b` is a list where the elements at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` are incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the integer in `s`. `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least `n` integers between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `r` is the string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the integers in `s`, repeated according to the number of times each integer appears in `s`. `i` is the last integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`.**
