To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `array`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `array`.
   - For the loop to execute, `array` must contain at least one element.

2. **Given States**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is a list of `l` zeros.
   - `array` is a list of integers, each greater than 0.
   - `ans` is an empty string.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute if `array` has at least one element.
   - The variable `j` will take the value of the first element in `array` during the first iteration.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `s` is a list of `l` zeros.
- `array` must have at least one element, and each element must be greater than 0.
- `j` is the first element in `array`.
- `ans` is an empty string.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` must have at least one element, each element in `array` is greater than 0, `j` is the first element in `array`, `ans` is an empty string**.
