The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that outputs a string literal `'STAIRS'`. The initial state describes variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal provided.

Output: **STAIRS**
