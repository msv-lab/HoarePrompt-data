Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is increased by `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`, `x` is the next value in `cnt.values()`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is increased by `x // 4`.
- The value of `x` is the next value in `cnt.values()`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `x` is not provided, but it is the next value in the sequence of values from the dictionary `cnt`.
- The updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the integer division of `x` by 4.
