Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input.

2. **Calculation of Fireworks Visibility**:
   - The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m + 1` minutes using `A = int(m / a) + 1`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period `m + 1` minutes using `B = int(m / b) + 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of `A` and `B` for each test case, which is the total number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

4. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - The formula `int(m / a) + 1` is used to determine how many fireworks from the first installation are visible within the `m + 1` minute window.
   - The formula `int(m / b) + 1` is used to determine how many fireworks from the second installation are visible within the `m + 1` minute window.
   - These formulas are correct because they count the number of multiples of `a` and `b` within the range `[0, m]` and add 1 to include the initial launch.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1. In this case, the number of fireworks visible at the same time is `m + 2` because each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes, and both installations launch fireworks every minute.
   - The program also handles large values of `a`, `b`, and `m` up to \(10^{18}\), which is within the specified range.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `(6, 7, 4)`, the program calculates `A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 1` and `B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 1`, so the output is `2`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the input `(3, 4, 10)`, the program calculates `A = int(10 / 3) + 1 = 4` and `B = int(10 / 4) + 1 = 3`, so the output is `7`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the input `(7, 8, 56)`, the program calculates `A = int(56 / 7) + 1 = 9` and `B = int(56 / 8) + 1 = 8`, so the output is `17`, which matches the expected output.
   - For the input `(5, 6, 78123459896)`, the program calculates `A = int(78123459896 / 5) + 1 = 15624691979` and `B = int(78123459896 / 6) + 1 = 13020576650`, so the output is `28645268629`, which is close to the expected output but not exact. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with the formula or the understanding of the problem.

7. **Potential Issue**:
   - The formula `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` might not correctly account for the visibility period `m + 1` minutes. Specifically, it should consider the visibility period starting from the launch time and ending at `x + m`.

8. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula should be `A = (m + 1) // a + 1` and `B = (m + 1) // b + 1` to account for the visibility period correctly.

Given the potential issue with the formula, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
