Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`.
- Initially, `ans` is either 0 or Decimal('Infinity'), and `cnt` is either 0 or 1.
- If `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be updated to 0 because 0 is less than Decimal('Infinity').
- If `cnt` is 1, `ans` will remain 0 if it was already 0, or it will be updated to 1 if it was Decimal('Infinity').
- Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is 0 if `cnt` is 0, the final value of `ans` will be 0 regardless of whether `cnt` was 0 or 1.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `flag`, and `val` remain unchanged.
