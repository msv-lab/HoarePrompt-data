Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. This is a reasonable approach since it ensures that the vertices are divided into the minimum number of groups (cliques) based on the value of `k`.
   - The function initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`. `arr` is intended to store the assigned integers to the vertices, and `cliquess` is intended to store the clique index for each vertex.
   - The function iterates over the range of `cliques`, and for each clique, it calls `make_array` to assign values to the vertices and update the clique indices.
   - After all cliques are processed, the function prints the `arr` list, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` list. The `cliquess` list is printed as a list of zeros, which is incorrect because it should reflect the actual clique assignments.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function `make_array` is responsible for assigning values to a segment of the `arr` list and updating the corresponding segment of the `cliquess` list with the clique index.
   - The function calculates `small_element` and `big_element` as `left + 1` and `right + 1`, respectively. This is correct because it ensures that the values assigned to the vertices are distinct and within the range [1, n].
   - The function then divides the segment into two parts: the first half is filled in ascending order, and the second half is filled in descending order. This is a valid approach to ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for vertices within the same clique.
   - The function updates the `cliquess` list with the `clique` index for the segment. This is correct and ensures that the vertices are assigned to the appropriate cliques.

3. **Output Issues**:
   - The main issue is that the `cliquess` list is printed as a list of zeros, which is incorrect. The `cliquess` list should reflect the actual clique assignments, as calculated by `make_array`.
   - The `arr` list is correctly printed, and the number of cliques is also correctly printed.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for assigning values to vertices and creating cliques is correct.
   - However, the final output of the `cliquess` list is incorrect, which means the program does not meet the problem's requirements fully.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it prints the `cliquess` list as a list of zeros instead of the actual clique assignments. This needs to be fixed to ensure the program meets the problem's requirements.
