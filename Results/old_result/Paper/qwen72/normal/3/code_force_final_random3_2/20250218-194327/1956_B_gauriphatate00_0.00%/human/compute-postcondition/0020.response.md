Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `4 + 2 * n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[3 + 2 * n + 1]` to `data[3 + 4 * n - 1]`**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing it from `3 + 2 * n` to `4 + 2 * n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
