### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves `n` piles of stones.
   - On each turn, a player can choose a positive integer `k` that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove `k` stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list `a` of pile sizes and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The transformation is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and then subtracting each element from the previous one, effectively reducing the problem to a simpler form.
   - **Example:**
     - Input: `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
     - Output: `a_new = [3]`
     - Input: `a = [1, 7]`
     - Output: `a_new = [1, 6]`
     - Input: `a = [1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`
     - Output: `a_new = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 92]`
   - **Correctness:**
     - The function correctly identifies the unique pile sizes and transforms them into a list of differences.
     - This transformation is crucial for the recursive logic in `func_2` to work correctly.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function determines the winner of the game given the transformed pile sizes `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - **Base Cases:**
     - If `n == 1`, Alice wins because she can always remove all stones from the single pile.
     - If `n == 2`, the winner depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd. If it's even, Alice wins; if it's odd, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - For `n > 2`, the function recursively checks the outcome of the game if the smallest pile is removed.
     - If the recursive call indicates that the next player (Bob) will lose (`winNext == 2`), or if the smallest pile size is not 1 and the next player will win (`winNext == 1`), then Alice wins.
     - Otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Example:**
     - `a = [3]`, `n = 1` → `func_2([3], 1) = 1` (Alice wins)
     - `a = [1, 6]`, `n = 2` → `func_2([1, 6], 2) = 2` (Bob wins)
     - `a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 92]`, `n = 6` → `func_2([1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 92], 6) = 1` (Alice wins)
   - **Correctness:**
     - The base cases are correctly handled.
     - The recursive logic is correct because it considers the smallest pile and the outcome of the game without it.
     - The condition `if winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1)` ensures that Alice wins if Bob is forced to lose or if the smallest pile size is not 1 and Bob wins.

4. **Combining the Functions:**
   - The main logic of the program involves transforming the pile sizes using `func_1` and then determining the winner using `func_2`.
   - The transformation in `func_1` ensures that the problem is reduced to a simpler form where the recursive logic in `func_2` can be applied.
   - **Example:**
     - Input: `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
     - `func_1(a) = [3]`
     - `func_2([3], 1) = 1` (Alice wins)
     - Input: `a = [1, 7]`
     - `func_1(a) = [1, 6]`
     - `func_2([1, 6], 2) = 2` (Bob wins)
     - Input: `a = [1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`
     - `func_1(a) = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 92]`
     - `func_2([1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 92], 6) = 1` (Alice wins)

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Base Cases:**
     - For `n == 1`, Alice wins, which is correct.
     - For `n == 2`, the winner is determined by the parity of the smallest pile size, which is correct.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - The recursive logic correctly handles the game's dynamics by considering the smallest pile and the outcome of the game without it.
     - The transformation in `func_1` ensures that the recursive calls are made on a simplified version of the problem, which is essential for the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The transformation and recursive checks are appropriate for the game's rules and constraints.

Final: **True**
