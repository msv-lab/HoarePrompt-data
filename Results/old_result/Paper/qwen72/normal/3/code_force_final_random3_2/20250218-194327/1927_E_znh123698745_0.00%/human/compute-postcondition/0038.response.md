The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, so `a[0]` is 1. After the increment, `a[0]` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and the first element of `array`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.**
