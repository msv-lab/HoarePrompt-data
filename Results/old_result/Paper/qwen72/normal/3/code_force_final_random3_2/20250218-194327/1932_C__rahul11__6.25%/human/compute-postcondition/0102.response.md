Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers, each initialized to 0, `ans` is 1, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` from the beginning to `n-2`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `c` is `n`, `k` is `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

The code snippet `ans = 1` sets the variable `ans` to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
