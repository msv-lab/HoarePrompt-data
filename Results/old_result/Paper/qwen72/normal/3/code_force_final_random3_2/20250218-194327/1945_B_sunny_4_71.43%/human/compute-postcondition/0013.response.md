Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user, `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is undefined.**

The value of `A` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `a` plus 1. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged, and `B` is still undefined.
