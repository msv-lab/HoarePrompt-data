Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`**

Explanation:
- `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value. Since `sum` was initially 0, the new value of `sum` is `i * n`.
- The values of `j`, `t`, `_`, `r`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n` still holds true.
