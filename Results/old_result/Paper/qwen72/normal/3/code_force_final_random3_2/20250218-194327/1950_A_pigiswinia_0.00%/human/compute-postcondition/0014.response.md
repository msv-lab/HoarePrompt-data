Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`.
- Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true.
- Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` is false, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('STAIRS')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'STAIRS'`.
- The initial state provides conditions for the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'STAIRS'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **STAIRS**
