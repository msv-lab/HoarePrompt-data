Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `range(30)` remains a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. If the bit at position 1 of `x` is set (i.e., `x` is an odd number when considering the bit at position 1), `s` now contains the string `'1'` as its last element. Otherwise, `s` now contains the string `'0'` as its last element. Additionally, if the bit at position 0 of `x` was set (i.e., `x` is an odd number), `s` contains the string `'1'` as its second-to-last element. If the bit at position 0 of `x` was not set (i.e., `x` is an even number), `s` contains the string `'0'` as its second-to-last element. If the bit at position 2 of `x` is set, `'1'` is appended to `s`. Otherwise, `'0'` is appended to `s`.**
