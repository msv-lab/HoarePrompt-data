Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1`, `log2(n)` must be greater than `power`, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

The value of `power` is decremented by 1, so `power` is now the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
