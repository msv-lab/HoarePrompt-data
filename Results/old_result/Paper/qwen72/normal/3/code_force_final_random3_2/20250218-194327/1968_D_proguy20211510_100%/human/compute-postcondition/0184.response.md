Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, and `ps` remain unchanged; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1; and `resb` is greater than `ress`.**
