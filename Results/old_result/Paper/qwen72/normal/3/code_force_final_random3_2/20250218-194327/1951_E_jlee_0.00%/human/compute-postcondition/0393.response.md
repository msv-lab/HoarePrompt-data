Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, and `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` is greater than `count`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 1 or less and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `count` remains greater than 0. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1 and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is now 1. Otherwise, `count` remains greater than 0.***
