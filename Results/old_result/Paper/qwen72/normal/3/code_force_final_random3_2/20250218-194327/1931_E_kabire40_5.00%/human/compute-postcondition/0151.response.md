The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers in the list, an integer `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6) determining the winning condition, and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the result of each test case based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (the number of integers in the list), an integer `m` (the winning condition), and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns the result for each test case based on the given parameters.**
