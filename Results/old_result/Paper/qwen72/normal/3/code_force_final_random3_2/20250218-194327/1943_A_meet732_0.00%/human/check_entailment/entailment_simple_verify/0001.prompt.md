You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`, and the array `a` itself, which contains `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program retains all initial conditions. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is the smallest index in the range 1 to `n` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists, and `c` is 0 if `j` is less than `n` and `cntl[j]` is less than 2, otherwise `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and increments the count of each element in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if the count of `0` in `cntl` is `0`. If so, it prints `0` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX of the final array `c` will be `0`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program initializes a variable `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is because Alice can pick at most two `0`s to maximize the score, and Bob can pick at most one `0` to minimize the score.
   - The program then iterates through the elements from `1` to `n`:
     - If the count of the current element `j` is less than `2`, it means that Bob can pick this element to prevent Alice from picking it twice.
     - The program decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last element. If either condition is true, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct MEX value for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case where `0` is not in the array.
- The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element and uses this information to determine the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.
- The logic for determining the MEX value is sound, as it ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the counts of elements and the constraints of the game.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
