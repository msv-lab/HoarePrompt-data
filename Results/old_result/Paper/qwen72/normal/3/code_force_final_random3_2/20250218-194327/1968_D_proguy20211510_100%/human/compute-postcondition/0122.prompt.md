Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` or `k`, whichever is smaller, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `curr` is the value of `pres + paths[i-1] * (k - (i-1))` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged, `ress` is the maximum value encountered during the loop, which is the maximum of the initial `ress` and all values of `curr` computed in each iteration, and if `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to `resb`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, except `vis[pb - 1]` which is now 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `pathb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged; `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged. If `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `pathb` is updated to include `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged. If `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `pathb` is updated to include `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
