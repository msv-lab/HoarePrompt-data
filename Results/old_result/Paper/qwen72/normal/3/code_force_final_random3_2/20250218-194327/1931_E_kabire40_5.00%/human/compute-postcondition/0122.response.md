Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `y` remains 2.
- The condition `int(input())` is greater than 2 remains true.
- `list_len` and `max_power` remain the same as the first and second parts of the input string, respectively.
- `operational_list` remains the list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string.
- `rev_val` is a list that contains the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string.
- `rev_res` is a string that contains the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string.
