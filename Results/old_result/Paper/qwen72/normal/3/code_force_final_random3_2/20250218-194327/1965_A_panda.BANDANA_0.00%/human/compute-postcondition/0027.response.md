Output State: **`t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `l`, and `m` is the length of the list `l`. If `1` is in the list `l`, the set `e` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in the set `e`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, an integer in the range 1 to 10^4.
- The loop index `i` is now `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- For each iteration, `n` was an input integer representing the number of piles.
- `l` was a list of integers provided by the user for each test case.
- `e` was a set containing the unique elements from the list `l` for each test case.
- `m` was the length of the list `l` for each test case.
- For each test case, if the list `l` contained the integer 1, the output was "Bob". Otherwise, the output was "Alice".
