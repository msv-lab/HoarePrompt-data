Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 250\).
   - `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
   - `k` and `q` are assigned integer values from the input.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times.
   - `n` is the third element of `qs`.

2. **Understanding the Code:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`.
   - This statement will convert each element of the list `res` to a string, join them with a space, and then print the resulting string.

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - `res` is a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times.
   - `n` is the third element of `qs`.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `func_1(n, p)` is a function that takes two arguments: `n` (an integer) and `p` (a list of integers). The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we can only describe its output in terms of the function itself.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the elements of `res` separated by spaces.
   - Since `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, the output will be three values, each the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Given the initial state and the code, the output will be:

Output: **func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p) (where n is the third element of the list `qs` and `p` is the list of integers provided by the user)**

This means that the `print` statement will output three identical values, each being the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the third element of the list `qs` and `p` is the list of integers provided by the user.
