Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 2`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.***
