Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `max(len_a, len_b)` is greater than 1. If `len_b` > 2, and if `len_a` > 2 and `a[1]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 2, and `count_b` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `b[1]` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `count_a` and `count_b` remain 1 or 0 and 1 or 2 based on the initial conditions. If `len_b` is not greater than 2, `count_a` and `count_b` remain 1 or 0 and 1 or 2 based on the initial conditions.***
