Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and for each element `a`, it calculates:
     - `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` to handle negative remainders correctly.
     - `ry` as `a % y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency to the count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads the input from standard input.
   - It splits the input into lines and processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, extracting the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` from the input.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - After collecting all test cases, it calls `func_1` to process them and get the results.
   - It prints each result on a new line.

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs based on the given conditions:
- `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
- `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

The use of remainders and the frequency dictionary ensures that the pairs are counted efficiently. The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
