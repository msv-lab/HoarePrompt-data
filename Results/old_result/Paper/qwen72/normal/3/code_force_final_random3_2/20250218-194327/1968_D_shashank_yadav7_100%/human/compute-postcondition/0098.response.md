Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1` if `k` was greater than 0 initially and the loop executed fully, otherwise `i` is the value at the time `k` became 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is 0 if the loop executed fully or the value at the time `k` became 0.
   - `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran.
   - `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `p` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `sp` is the sum of the initial `sp` and all values of `a[s]` added during the loop.
   - `bp` is the sum of the initial `bp` and all values of `a[b]` added during the loop.
   - `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` computed during the loop.
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` computed during the loop.
   - `bm` is less than `sm`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('Sasha')
   ```

The print statement simply prints the string `'Sasha'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement, as it is a static string.

Output: **Sasha**
