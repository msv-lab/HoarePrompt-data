The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `2`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the value `2` that is explicitly provided in the statement.

Output: **2**
