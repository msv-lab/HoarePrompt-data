Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are the second and third integers input by the user, respectively. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.***
