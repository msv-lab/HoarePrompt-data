Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer minus 2, `b` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `p` minus 1, `s` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `p` minus 1, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` value and the value of `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` value and the value of `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are still valid.
- The value of `b` is now the integer value at the index `b` in the list `p` minus 1.
