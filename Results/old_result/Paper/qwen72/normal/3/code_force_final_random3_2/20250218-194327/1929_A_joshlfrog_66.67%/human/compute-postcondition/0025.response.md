The only variables in the loop head are `e` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `e` relative to `t`. If `e` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is 0 and `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500. At the start of the next iteration, `e` will be incremented by 1, so `e` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**
