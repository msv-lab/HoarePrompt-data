You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), trump_suit (a character from "CDHS"), and cards (a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards from `user_input` whose suit matches `trump`, `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, with each rank followed by the suit. The `suits` dictionary has keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are set to `None`.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to a non-`None` value. The `trumps` list is empty, and `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, and each string is in the format 'rank suit trumps.pop() trump' for each non-None rank in `suits` that had a corresponding trump card. If `trumps` was empty before the loop finished, the program would have returned `None` and the loop would have terminated early.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is now empty, and all elements that were in `trumps` have been printed in pairs, each followed by the `trump` suit. The `answers` list remains unchanged, containing the strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, and each string is in the format 'rank suit trumps.pop() trump' for each non-None rank in `suits` that had a corresponding trump card. The values of `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `user_input`, and `trump` remain unchanged, and the `suits` dictionary also remains unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is now empty, and all elements in the `answers` list have been printed. The `answers` list remains unchanged, and all other variables (`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `user_input`, and `suits`) remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 16), `trump_suit` (a character from "CDHS"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing card ranks and suits). The function does not return any value in most cases, and in one specific case, it returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: The program returns `None`.
