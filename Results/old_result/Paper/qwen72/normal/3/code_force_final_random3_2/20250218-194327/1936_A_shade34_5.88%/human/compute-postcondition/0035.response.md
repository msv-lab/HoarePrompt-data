Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is either '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is an empty list.
   - `s` is the input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the input string `s` during the loop execution. If `s` was '<' at any point, `mak` will be the largest integer `i` for which this condition was true. If no such input was provided, `mak` will be 0.
   - The value of `mak2` is explicitly given as equal to `mak`.
   - The value of `pans` is not directly printed in the statement, so we don't need to consider it for the output.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `s` was '<' at any point during the loop execution, `mak` and `mak2` will be the largest integer `i` for which `s` was '<'.
   - If `s` was never '<' during the loop execution, `mak` and `mak2` will both be 0.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 1 [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided)**
