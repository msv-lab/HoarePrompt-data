Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing the value 2.
   - If `res` is '=', `arr` now includes the value 2 as its last element.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - The next value is `maxi`, which is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - The next value is `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the list `arr`.
   - The next value is `maxi` again.
   - The final value is `i`, which is 3.

4. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since `res` is an input string, we need to consider the two possible cases:
     - **Case 1: `res` is '<'**
       - `arr` is a list containing the value 2.
       - `arr[0]` is 2.
       - `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'. Without more specific information about the comparisons, we can only say that `maxi` is some index in the list.
     - **Case 2: `res` is '='**
       - `arr` now includes the value 2 as its last element.
       - `arr[0]` is 2 (since the list starts with 2 and 2 is added as the last element).
       - `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'. Again, without more specific information, we can only say that `maxi` is some index in the list.

5. **Output:**
   - In both cases, `arr[0]` is 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `maxi` is some index in the list, but we don't have a specific value for it.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [maxi] 2 [maxi] 3 (where [maxi] is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<')**
