You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` such that `1 <= x < q <= 10^9`. It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` (including `q` itself) that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `q` is a perfect square and its square root is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the square root is also included in the list. The list `M` may be empty if no such divisors exist.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - For \( k = 2 \), the pattern is \( 1, 2, 1, 2, \ldots \).
   - For \( k = 3 \), the pattern is \( 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, \ldots \).
   - For \( k = 5 \), the pattern is \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, \ldots \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received must fit the pattern.
   - The pattern can be described by the sequence \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, \ldots, 2 \).
   - The length of one complete cycle is \( 2k - 2 \).
   - Vasya's position \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should give a valid position in the cycle.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls `func_1` with \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It also checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and if so, calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two arguments \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates \( w = \sqrt{q} \).
   - If \( w \) is an integer and \( w \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( w \) to \( M \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \lfloor w \rfloor \) and checks if \( q \) is divisible by \( i \).
   - If \( q \) is divisible by \( i \), it adds \( i \) to \( M \) if \( i \geq x - 1 \).
   - It also adds \( q // i \) to \( M \) if \( q // i \geq x - 1 \).
   - It returns the list \( M \).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - The calculation of \( q \) and the use of `func_1` to find divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) is a valid approach to find possible \( k \) values.
   - The additional check for \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and the second call to `func_1` is necessary to cover all possible \( k \) values.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates and the final length calculation is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
