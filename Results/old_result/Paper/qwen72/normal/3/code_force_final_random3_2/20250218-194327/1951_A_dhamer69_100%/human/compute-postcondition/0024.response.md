The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `s`) remain unchanged. The specific values of `start`, `end`, and `t` are not affected, and `s` is still the input string.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string.**
