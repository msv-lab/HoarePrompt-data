Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list that now includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is the input string. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 of list `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1 and `b[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes are made to `a` or `b`.***
