Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print(k)` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `m` are input integers where both `n` and `m` are greater than 0.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `k`**:
   - `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - Mathematically, this is expressed as \( k = |n - m| \).
   - Since `n` and `m` are both positive integers, the absolute difference will always be a non-negative integer.

2. **Values of `n` and `m`**:
   - The exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, but we know they are positive integers.
   - Therefore, `k` will be a non-negative integer representing the difference between `n` and `m`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
