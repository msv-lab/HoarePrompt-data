Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `a` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is the value of `freq[rx, ry]` (which is 0 because `freq` is an empty dictionary), `results` is a list containing the value 0, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, and the tuple `(rx, ry)` is a key in the dictionary `freq`.**

Explanation:
- The code `count += freq[rx, ry]` increments the value of `count` by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.
- Since `freq` is an empty dictionary, `freq[rx, ry]` is 0.
- Therefore, `count` is incremented by 0, so `count` remains 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
