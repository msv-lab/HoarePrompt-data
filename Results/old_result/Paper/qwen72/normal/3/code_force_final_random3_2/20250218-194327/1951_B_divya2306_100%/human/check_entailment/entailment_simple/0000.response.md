### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined, but it does not match the problem description. The correct function should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):`.
   - The input handling is correct for reading the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` iterates through the list of ratings to count how many cows your cow can defeat before encountering a stronger cow.
   - The condition `if a[i] > a[k - 1]: break` correctly stops the loop when a stronger cow is found.
   - The variable `wins` is incremented correctly for each cow your cow can defeat.

3. **Optimal Swap Calculation:**
   - The condition `if (wins >= k):` checks if your cow can already win at least `k-1` matches without any swaps. If so, it prints `wins - 1` and returns, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `wins - 1` if `wins > 1`, otherwise `0`.
   - The variable `win_with_swap` is initialized to `wins + 1`, which is the number of wins if the cow is swapped to the position right after the initial wins.
   - The loop `for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):` iterates from the position after the initial wins to the position just before your cow's original position to count additional wins if the cow is swapped.
   - The condition `if a[i] > a[k - 1]: break` correctly stops the loop when a stronger cow is found in the new position range.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is `print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))`, which is intended to print the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.
   - However, the expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is incorrect. It should be `win_with_swap - 1` to correctly represent the number of wins after the swap.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
- The program incorrectly handles the case where `wins >= k`. It should print `wins - 1` if `wins > 1`, otherwise `0`.
- The final output expression is incorrect. It should be `print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - 1))` to correctly represent the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

### Corrected Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        wins = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
                break
            wins += 1
        
        if wins > 1:
            print(wins - 1)
            continue
        
        win_with_swap = wins + 1
        for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
            if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
                break
            win_with_swap += 1
        
        print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - 1))
```

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output.
