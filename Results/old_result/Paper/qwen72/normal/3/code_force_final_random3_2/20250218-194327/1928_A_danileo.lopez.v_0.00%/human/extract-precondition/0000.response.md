Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def can_form_another_rectangle(a, b):
```

Precondition: **a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.**
