Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (this is likely a condition for the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the print statement).
   - `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required).
   - `n` is an input integer, representing the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, with each element in the range \(1 \leq a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b` up to the last element of `b`.
   - `j` is `n-1` (this is the index of the last element in the list `a`).
   - `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` up to the last element of `b`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(cnt)`.

3. **Determine the Value of `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is defined as the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a`.
   - Since `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is the smallest element in `a`.
   - `cnt` will count how many elements in `b` are less than `a[0]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `cnt`.

Given the initial state, the value of `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element of `a`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element of `a`)**
