Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `i` is `t - 1`, `l` is an input integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except for the elements corresponding to the indices in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers read from input, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `i` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The variable `l` will be the last input integer read for the length of the list `s`, and `s` will be a list of `l` integers, where each element is 0 except for those indices that were present in the corresponding `array` for each iteration, which will be incremented by the number of times their index appeared in `array`. The variable `array` will be the list of integers read from input for the last iteration, and `j` will be the last element in this `array`. The variable `ans` will be a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from the initial state.
