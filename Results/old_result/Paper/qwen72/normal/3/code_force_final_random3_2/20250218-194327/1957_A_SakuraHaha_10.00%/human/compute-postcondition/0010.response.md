Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer within the range 1 to 100, representing the length of the list `a`.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers, each within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `ans` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The dictionary `cnt` contains keys that are the unique integers from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.
