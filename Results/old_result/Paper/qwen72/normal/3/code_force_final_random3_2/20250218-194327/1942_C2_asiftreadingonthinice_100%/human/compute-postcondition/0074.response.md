Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 1`. `y` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `tmp` is an empty list or a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, then `ans` was initially `x + y - 1`, and now it is `x + y - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `x + y`.
- Otherwise, `ans` was initially `x + y - 2`, and now it is `x + y - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `x + y - 1`.
- The values of `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged.
- `ii` is still `tt - 1`, and `tt` is still greater than `ii`.
- `i` remains 3.
- `tmp` remains an empty list or a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number.
