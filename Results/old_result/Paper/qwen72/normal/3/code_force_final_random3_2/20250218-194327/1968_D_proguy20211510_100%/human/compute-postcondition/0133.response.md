Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` remain unchanged; `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to its end; `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` remain unchanged. The list `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to its end. The variable `ps` is updated to be equal to `p[ps - 1]`. If the value of `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
