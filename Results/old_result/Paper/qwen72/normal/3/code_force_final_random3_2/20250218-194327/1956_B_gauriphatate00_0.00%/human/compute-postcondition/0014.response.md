Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `3 + n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `3 + n`.
- The states of the other variables (`input`, `data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
