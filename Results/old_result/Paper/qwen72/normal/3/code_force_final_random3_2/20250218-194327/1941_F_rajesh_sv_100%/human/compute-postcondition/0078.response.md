Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `f` is the first value in `F`, and the other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) retain their values from the initial state. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value `max_diff` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. Otherwise, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value `max_diff` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, and `h` is updated to `mid`. In both cases, `l` must be less than `h`.**
