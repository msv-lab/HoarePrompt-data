Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
2. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
3. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
4. `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
5. `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
6. The value of `s` is greater than `l`.
7. `s` is not equal to 1.
8. `s` is less than or equal to `r`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input**: The user provides two integers, `l` and `r`, and it is assumed that `int(input())` is greater than 0. This means `l` and `r` are valid integers.
2. **Index Calculation**: `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order. This implies that `arr` is a sorted list of tuples.
3. **Tuple Extraction**: `s` and `e` are extracted from the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Here, `LA` is the length of `arr`.
4. **Conditions on `s`**:
   - `s` is greater than `l`.
   - `s` is not equal to 1.
   - `s` is less than or equal to `r`.

### Output Determination:
- The `print` statement will output the values of `s - 1` and `s`.
- Since `s` is greater than `l` and less than or equal to `r`, `s - 1` will be a value that is greater than or equal to `l` and less than `s`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `s - 1` and `s`, where `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `s` is greater than `l`, not equal to 1, and less than or equal to `r`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and s is greater than l, not equal to 1, and less than or equal to r)**
