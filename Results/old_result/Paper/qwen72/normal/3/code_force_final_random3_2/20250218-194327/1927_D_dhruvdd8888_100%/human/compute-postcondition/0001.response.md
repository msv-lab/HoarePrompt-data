The value of `N` is assigned the integer value read from the input using `sys.stdin.readline`. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)`. The list `a` contains integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the length of `a` is 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each query `(l, r)` satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The number of test cases `t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the total number of queries across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The `input` function is now `sys.stdin.readline`. `N` is an input integer.**
