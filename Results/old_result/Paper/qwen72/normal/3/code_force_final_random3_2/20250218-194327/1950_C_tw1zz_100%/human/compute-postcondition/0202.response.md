Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to the minute part of the input string, `_` is incremented by 1, `h1` and `time` remain as determined based on the value of `h`**

Explanation:
- The input string `s` is split by the colon `:` and the resulting hour and minute parts are assigned to `h` and `m` respectively.
- `m1` is updated to be equal to the minute part of the input string.
- The values of `t`, `h1`, and `time` remain unchanged.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1.
