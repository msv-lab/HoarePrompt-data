### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track whether Alice or Bob will win.
   - It creates a sorted list `set_` of unique elements from `arr`.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - If the smallest pile size in `set_` is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. Hence, the function returns 'Alice'.

4. **Consecutive Differences Check:**
   - The program then checks if the differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are all 1.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - If the differences are all 1, it toggles `A` for each element in `set_`.

5. **Final Toggle:**
   - If `not_c` is `True` (i.e., all differences are 1), it toggles `A` one more time.

6. **Return Statement:**
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise 'Bob'.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: Smallest Pile Size is Not 1:**
  - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. This is correctly handled by the initial check.

- **Case 2: Smallest Pile Size is 1:**
  - If the smallest pile size is 1, the game becomes more complex. The key is to check if the differences between consecutive pile sizes are all 1.
  - If the differences are all 1, the game can be reduced to a sequence of moves where each player can only choose `k=1`. The number of moves required to empty all piles is the maximum pile size, and the winner depends on whether this number is odd or even.
  - The program toggles `A` for each element in `set_`, which is equivalent to checking if the number of unique pile sizes is odd or even. This is a correct approach because if the number of unique pile sizes is odd, Alice will win, and if it is even, Bob will win.

- **Final Toggle:**
  - The final toggle of `A` when `not_c` is `True` is necessary to account for the initial state where `A` is `False`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the winner based on the initial pile sizes and the optimal play strategy.
