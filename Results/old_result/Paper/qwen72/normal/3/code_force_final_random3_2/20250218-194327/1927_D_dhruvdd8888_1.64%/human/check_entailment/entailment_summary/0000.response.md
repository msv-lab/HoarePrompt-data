Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by identifying contiguous segments of the same value in the input array `nums` and then using binary search to quickly find the relevant segments for each query. However, there are several issues with the implementation that affect its correctness:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is called within a loop that iterates `tc` times, but `func_1` itself reads input from `sys.stdin` without considering the test case context. This can lead to incorrect input handling, especially when multiple test cases are provided.
   - The `input` function should be defined outside of `func_1` to avoid redefining it in each call, and the input should be handled correctly to ensure each test case is processed independently.

2. **Segment Identification**:
   - The program correctly identifies contiguous segments of the same value and stores them in `arr` as tuples of the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`.
   - However, the program appends a `-1` to `nums` to handle edge cases, which is unnecessary and can cause issues if `-1` is a valid value in the input.

3. **Binary Search and Query Handling**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or just after the query range `l`.
   - The logic for determining whether a valid pair of indices exists within the query range is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for checking if the segment boundaries are within the query range are not correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program has some conditional logic that seems to be for debugging or special cases (e.g., `if ppp == 23` and `if tc > 5`). These conditions are not part of the problem specification and should be removed to ensure the program works correctly for all inputs.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program should print the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the query range. If no such pair exists, it should print `-1 -1`. The current logic does not always ensure this condition is met.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
