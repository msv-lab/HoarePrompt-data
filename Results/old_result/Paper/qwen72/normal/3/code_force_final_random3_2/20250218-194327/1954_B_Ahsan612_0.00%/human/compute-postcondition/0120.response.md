Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique number in the list `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list, and `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, then `minn` is updated to the value of `same`. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.***
