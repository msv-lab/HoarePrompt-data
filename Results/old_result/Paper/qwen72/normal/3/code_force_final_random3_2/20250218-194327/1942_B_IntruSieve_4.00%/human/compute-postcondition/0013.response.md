Output State: **`maxx` is 0, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` (which is less than or equal to 0) minus `minn` (which is 0), `minn` is 0, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `arr` is less than or equal to 0.**

In natural language: The variable `mex` now contains a single element, which is the absolute value of the element at index `i` of the list `arr` (since `i` is 0 and `minn` is 0, this is simply the absolute value of the first element of `arr`). All other variables remain unchanged.
