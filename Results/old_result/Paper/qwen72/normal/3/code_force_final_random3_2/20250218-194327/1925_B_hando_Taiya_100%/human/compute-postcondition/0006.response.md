Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). If `n` <= `x // i`, `ans` is the maximum value between 0 and 1 (which is 1), and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
