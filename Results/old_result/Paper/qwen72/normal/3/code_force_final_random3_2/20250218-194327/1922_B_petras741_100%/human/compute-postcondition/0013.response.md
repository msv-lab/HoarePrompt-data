Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer, which is greater than or equal to 3.
- The list `w` is unchanged and still contains the integers input by the user.
- The list `q` is now a list of `n + 1` integers, where each element at the index corresponding to the elements in `w` has been incremented by 1. Specifically, for each index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, the element `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1.
- The loop index `j` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
