The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the initial state for the loop to begin its first iteration. The state of `buffer` and the description of the input format do not affect the loop head directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
