The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `mdx`, `i`, `res`) remain unchanged. Since `t` must be greater than 0, the new value of `t` is the previous value of `t` minus 1, which is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 1 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
