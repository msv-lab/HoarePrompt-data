Postcondition: **`maxx` is 0, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` (which is less than or equal to 0) minus `minn` (which is 0), `minn` is 0, `i` is 0, and the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` is greater than `maxx`.**
