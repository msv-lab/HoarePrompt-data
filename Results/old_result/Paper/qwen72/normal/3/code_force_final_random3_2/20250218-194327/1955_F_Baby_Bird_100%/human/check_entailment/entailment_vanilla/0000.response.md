### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Condition Analysis:**
   - For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
   - For Alice to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be non-zero.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - The key is to balance the counts of the numbers to achieve this.

5. **Count Analysis:**
   - Let \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) be the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The XOR of the sequence can be simplified by considering the parity of the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - Specifically, the XOR of the sequence is zero if and only if the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all even or all odd.

6. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by summing the results of the expression \( 3 * (x // 2) + x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) for each count \( p_i \).
   - The expression \( 3 * (x // 2) \) counts the number of pairs of the same number that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - The expression \( x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) adds an extra 1 if there is an odd count of 1, 2, or 3, which helps in balancing the sequence to achieve a zero XOR.
   - The sum is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

7. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic of the program aligns with the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

### Correctness:
