The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned based on the user input, and the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are no longer relevant. The condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` will be evaluated based on the new values of `a` and `b`. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The parity of `n` (whether it is odd or even) does not affect the final conditions, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the input.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n`, `a`, and `b` are the new integer values input by the user, and the condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` holds based on the new values of `a` and `b`.**
