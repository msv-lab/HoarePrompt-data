Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing the second element of the reversed `ops` list, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, `p1` or `p2` has been appended with the new `v1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)` appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.
- If `p1[-1]` (the last element of `p1`) is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `vx`, `ops`, `int(input())`, and the initial conditions for `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the condition and the value of `v1`.
