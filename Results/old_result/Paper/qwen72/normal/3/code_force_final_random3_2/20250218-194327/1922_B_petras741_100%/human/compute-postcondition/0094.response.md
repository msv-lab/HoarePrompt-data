Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `j` is `n + eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is equal to the sum of all elements in `q` at indices in `eta`, and `res` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for all `j` in `eta` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` in `eta` except the first one.***
