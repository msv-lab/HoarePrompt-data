### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing stones from piles.
   - On each turn, a player must remove the same number of stones \( k \) from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a list `a` of positive integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It first sorts and removes duplicates from `a` to get a new list `a_new` of unique elements.
   - Then, it modifies each element in `a_new` to be the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the list of pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes the transformed list `a` and its length `n`.
   - It uses a recursive approach to determine the winner.
   - If `n` is 1, the function returns 1 (Alice wins) because Alice can always remove all stones from the single pile.
   - If `n` is 2, the function returns 1 if the first element of `a` is even (Alice wins) and 2 if it is odd (Bob wins). This is because if the first element is even, Alice can always choose a \( k \) that will leave an even number of stones in the second pile, ensuring Bob will be forced to leave an odd number of stones for Alice to win.
   - For `n` greater than 2, the function recursively calls itself with the list `a` excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1. It then checks the result of the recursive call:
     - If the recursive call returns 2 (Bob wins), or if it returns 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1, the function returns 1 (Alice wins).
     - Otherwise, it returns 2 (Bob wins).

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The transformation in `func_1` is crucial for simplifying the problem. By sorting and removing duplicates, and then computing the differences, the function effectively reduces the problem to a simpler form where the game can be analyzed based on the unique pile sizes and their differences.
   - The recursive logic in `func_2` correctly handles the base cases and the recursive step. It ensures that the game is analyzed optimally by considering the smallest pile and the remaining piles.
   - The program correctly prints "Alice" or "Bob" based on the result of `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
