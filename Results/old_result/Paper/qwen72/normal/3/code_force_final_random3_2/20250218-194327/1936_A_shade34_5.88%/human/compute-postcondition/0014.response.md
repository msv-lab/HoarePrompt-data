The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 0 or 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the input string is '<', `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
