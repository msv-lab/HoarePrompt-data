Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` and must have at least 4 characters.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 3.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`string` and `s`**:
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string` and must have at least 4 characters.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, and `n` must be greater than 3.

2. **`j`**:
   - `j` is set to 2.

3. **`string[:j]`**:
   - This will print the first 2 characters of `string`.

4. **`string[j:]`**:
   - This will print the characters of `string` starting from the 3rd character (index 2) to the end.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the first 2 characters of `string` followed by the rest of the characters in `string` starting from the 3rd character.

Output: **[first 2 characters of string] [rest of the characters in string starting from the 3rd character]**
