To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer provided by user input and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by user input.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(m // a + m // b + 2)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `m // a` performs integer division of `m` by `a`, which means it returns the quotient without the remainder.
   - `m // b` performs integer division of `m` by `b`, which means it returns the quotient without the remainder.
   - The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` adds the results of these two integer divisions and then adds 2 to the sum.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(m // a + m // b + 2) (where `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is added to the sum of these two results)**
