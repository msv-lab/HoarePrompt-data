Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being `lex` (where `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially, or between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially, or `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially), `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**

In natural language, the loop has completed all its iterations, and the variable `k` has reached the value 3. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The loop printed the characters corresponding to the first three elements of the `arr` array, each converted to a character by adding 96 to the array element and then converting it to a character using `chr`.
