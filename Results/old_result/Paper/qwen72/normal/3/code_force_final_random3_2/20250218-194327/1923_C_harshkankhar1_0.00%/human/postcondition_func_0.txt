The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `q`, where `n` is the length of a list `a` of positive integers and `q` is the number of queries. It then reads the list `a` and initializes a list `b` of the same length. The function computes the cumulative sum of a modified version of `a` (where each element is 1 if greater than 1, otherwise 2) and stores it in `b`. It also computes the cumulative sum of the original `a` list and prints it. For each query, which consists of two integers `x` and `y`, the function prints 'NO' if the sum of elements in `a` from index `x` to `y` is less than the corresponding sum in `b` or if `x` equals `y`; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all queries, the function concludes with the cumulative sums of `a` and `b` computed and the results of the queries printed.
