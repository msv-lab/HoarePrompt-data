You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`, where `2 <= n <= 100` and each element in `arr` is an integer such that `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`. It returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a new list `new_arr`, which is constructed by rearranging the elements of the sorted `arr` in a specific pattern: the last element is appended first, followed by the first element, then the second-to-last element, followed by the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended last. The final state of the program includes `arr` being sorted, `new_arr` containing the rearranged elements, and `max_beauty` holding the computed sum of absolute differences.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` for constructing `new_arr` is flawed. The algorithm alternates between appending the largest and smallest remaining elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The expected output is 6, as the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, where the beauty is calculated as:
```
(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 6
```

However, the program constructs `new_arr` as `[4, 1, 3, 2]` and calculates the beauty as:
```
(1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2
```

This is clearly incorrect, as the beauty should be maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
