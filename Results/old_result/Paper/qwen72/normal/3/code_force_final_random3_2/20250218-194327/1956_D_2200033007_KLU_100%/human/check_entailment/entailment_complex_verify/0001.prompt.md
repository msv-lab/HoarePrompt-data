You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `start_index` and `end_index` and a list `arr` of integers, and returns the maximum value based on a recursive computation.

Otherwise, it computes the maximum value among several recursive calls and the length of the subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.

The final state of the program is that `res_dict` contains the computed values for the given `start_index` and `end_index` ranges, and the function returns the maximum value for the specified range.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(`arr`), and `arr` is a list of integers. The function returns a list of tuples, each representing a range within `arr`. The function's behavior is as follows:

1. If the length of the sublist `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` is 1 and the single element in this sublist is greater than 0, the function returns an empty list.
2. If the length of the sublist is 1 and the single element is less than or equal to 0, the function returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`.
3. If the length of the sublist is greater than 1 and the maximum value in the sublist is equal to the square of the length of the sublist, the function returns a list containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function searches for an index `i` within the range `(start_index + 1, end_index)` such that the sum of `func_1(start_index, i - 1)`, `func_1(i + 1, end_index)`, and `arr[i]` equals the maximum value in the sublist. If such an index is found, the function returns the concatenation of the results from `func_2(start_index, i - 1)` and `func_2(i + 1, end_index)`.
5. If no such index `i` is found, the function checks if the sum of `arr[start_index]` and `func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` equals the maximum value. If it does, the function returns the result of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)`.
6. If the above condition is not met, the function checks if the sum of `arr[end_index]` and `func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` equals the maximum value. If it does, the function returns the result of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)`.
7. If none of the conditions are met, the function does not return anything, resulting in `None` being returned.

If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, the function `make_stairs` is called with `i - 1` as the argument. Otherwise, for all indices `k` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive), `arr[k]` is `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, with `i` now being `i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and modifies the list `arr` and the list `res` based on the values in `arr` starting from `start_index`. If the elements in `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i` form a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`, the function returns `None` without making any changes. Otherwise, it appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to `res` and sets all elements in `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i` to `i`. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index]` using dynamic programming.
   - It uses a dictionary `res_dict` to memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the function returns the maximum of 1 and the single element in the subarray.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it recursively computes the maximum sum by considering different splits of the subarray and the MEX value of the subarray.
   - However, the function does not correctly compute the MEX value. It seems to be using a heuristic that is not aligned with the MEX definition.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum value and then tries to backtrack to find the operations that lead to this value.
   - The function has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the maximum value is equal to `length ** 2`. This condition is not aligned with the MEX operation and the problem's requirements.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - The function checks if the subarray is already a staircase and returns if it is.
   - If the subarray is not a staircase, it recursively transforms the subarray.
   - The function updates the subarray and appends the operation to the result list `res`.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the MEX transformation and the updates to the array are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX value.
   - The backtracking logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly reconstruct the sequence of operations.
   - The `make_stairs` function does not correctly transform the subarray into the desired MEX values.
   - The program does not meet the problem's requirements for maximizing the sum and constructing the sequence of operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program contains logical errors in the computation of the MEX value and the construction of the sequence of operations, leading to incorrect results.
