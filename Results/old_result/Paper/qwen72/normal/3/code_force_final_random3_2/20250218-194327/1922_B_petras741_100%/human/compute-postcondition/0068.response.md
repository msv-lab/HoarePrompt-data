Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing the integer 0, and `eta` now contains the integer 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` (which is 1) is appended to the list `eta`.
- If `q[1]` was greater than 0, `eta` initially contained the integer 0. After appending `j` (which is 1), `eta` now contains the integers [0, 1].
- If `q[1]` was not greater than 0, `eta` was initially an empty list. After appending `j` (which is 1), `eta` now contains the integer [1].
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `q`) remain unchanged.
