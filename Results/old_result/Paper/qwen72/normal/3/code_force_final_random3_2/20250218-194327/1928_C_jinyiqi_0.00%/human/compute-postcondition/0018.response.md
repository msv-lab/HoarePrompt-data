Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 and returns a list that combines two sublists: `output2` and `output1`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in decreasing order. The resulting list is a combination of `output2` followed by `output1`.**
