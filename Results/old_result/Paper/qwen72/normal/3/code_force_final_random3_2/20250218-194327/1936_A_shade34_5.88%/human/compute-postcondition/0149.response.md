The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence from 1 to `n-1`, and this sequence must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is set to start at 1, which is already correct for the loop to begin.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
