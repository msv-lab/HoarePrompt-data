The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop decrements `j` by 1 for each iteration, starting from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 3`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` which is now `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` if `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)` if `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n])` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now `max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1)`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now `max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1, dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n])`. `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 3`.**
