The value of `t` is assigned the integer value of the input provided by the user, which is expected to be an integer between 1 and 1000. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). Additionally, at least one cell in each test case contains a chip. The number of test cases `t` is an integer provided by the user and is between 1 and 1000.**
