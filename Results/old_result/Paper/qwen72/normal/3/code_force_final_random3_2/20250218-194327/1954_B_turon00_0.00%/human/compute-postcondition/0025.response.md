Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 2, `cnt` is either 2 or 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
- If `a[0]` is equal to `tmp` and `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`. After the code, `ans` will be the minimum of `n` and 2.
- If `a[0]` is equal to `tmp` and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is `n`. After the code, `ans` will be the minimum of `n` and 0, which is 0.
- If `a[0]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and 1. After the code, `ans` will be the minimum of 1 and 0, which is 0.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
