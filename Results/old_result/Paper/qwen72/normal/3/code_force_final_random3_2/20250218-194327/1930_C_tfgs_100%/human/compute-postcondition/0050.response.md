The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the last value in the range of `adv`, which means `j` was `adv - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `adv`. However, for the loop to continue, `adv` must be greater than `j`, so `adv` must be at least `j + 1`.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than `j + 1`, `ans` has a new element appended which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`**
