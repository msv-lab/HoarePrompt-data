Output State: **`mex` is a list containing all its elements, and the loop has printed each element of `mex` exactly once, separated by spaces.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, every element in the list `mex` has been printed out, one by one, with each element separated by a space. The list `mex` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed its execution by printing all the elements in `mex`.
