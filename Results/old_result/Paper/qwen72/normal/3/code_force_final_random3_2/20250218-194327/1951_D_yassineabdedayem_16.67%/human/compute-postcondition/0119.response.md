The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, but the previous values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**
