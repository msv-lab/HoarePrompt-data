### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `arr` as arguments.
   - The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good starting point because sorting helps in understanding the distribution of the elements.

3. **Rearranging the Array**:
   - The function then creates a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array `arr`.
   - This approach ensures that the difference between consecutive elements in `new_arr` is maximized, which is crucial for maximizing the beauty of the array.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Beauty**:
   - The function calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
   - The use of `abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` ensures that the differences are always positive, which is correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Output**:
   - The results of each test case are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Sorting the Array**:
  - Sorting the array is a valid step because it helps in identifying the largest and smallest elements, which are crucial for maximizing the beauty.

- **Rearranging the Array**:
  - The rearrangement strategy (alternating between the largest and smallest elements) is optimal for maximizing the sum of differences. This is because the largest difference between any two elements in a sorted array is always between the largest and smallest elements, and this strategy ensures that these differences are used as much as possible.

- **Calculating the Beauty**:
  - The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array. This is correct because the problem requires the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and rearranging the elements as described. The output for each test case is calculated and printed correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
