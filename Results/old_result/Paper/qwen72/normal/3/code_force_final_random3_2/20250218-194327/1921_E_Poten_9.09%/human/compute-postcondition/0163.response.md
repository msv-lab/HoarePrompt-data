Output State: **`i` is `test_cases` - 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' for each test case.**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `test_cases - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged and is still an integer greater than or equal to 1, representing the total number of test cases. The list `answers` will contain one of the strings 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' for each test case, based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each set of input values. Each string in the `answers` list corresponds to the result of the respective test case, as determined by the logic in the loop.
