The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n
- `_` is 0
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `i` is 2

After the loop head is evaluated:
- `i` is incremented to 3
- `n` remains the same

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
