Output State: **`j` is `n + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and `n + r` otherwise. `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`. `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and `2 * n + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`. `r` is 3, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to 3, as `i` is 3.
- The values of `j`, `t`, `_`, `sum`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` is still valid, and the values of `j` and `sum` are still determined based on this condition.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.
